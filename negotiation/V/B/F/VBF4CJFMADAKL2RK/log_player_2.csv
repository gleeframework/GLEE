"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents your absolute maximum price.  While there's a chance Alice will reject it, you've laid out your budget clearly and made it known that you're not willing to pay more. This puts the pressure on her to decide if she wants to sell or not."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still significantly more than what you're willing to pay.  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price in another counteroffer. There's always a chance she might accept your next offer or that the negotiation process might lead to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer but still lower than Alice's latest price. It shows you're willing to pay more than $800,000 but you're not willing to go above $900,000. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a price closer to your budget or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While the negotiation has been successful in getting the price down, it's unlikely she'll come down further.  It's now more beneficial to buy the product from John for my maximum price than to continue negotiating with Alice, who may not be willing to meet my budget."
