"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope you find this offer appealing and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high for Bob, who values the product at $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is limited.  Would you be willing to consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $85, which is still higher than his ideal price but lower than Alice's offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is trying to be reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback and understanding your current budget constraints. To accommodate your situation while still valuing our product, I am willing to consider a price of $95 for the product. I hope this revised offer better aligns with your financial considerations. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still trying to save as much money as possible. He can potentially get the product for $80 from John.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a price even lower than $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $95 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap. He's offering $90, which is a small compromise from his initial counteroffer but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows he's willing to be flexible and hopes to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. To further address your concerns, I'm proposing a price of $92 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value and quality of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $92 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, he can still get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting the offer gives him a chance to try and negotiate a price closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his last offer of $90. This shows persistence and a willingness to compromise. He's confident he can secure the deal at this price, especially since he has the alternative of buying from John for $80."
