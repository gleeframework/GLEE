Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the product's value to Bob. I'm hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate but also to make it clear that I'm not willing to sell it for less than its worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, as that's the minimum value I've set for the product. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give the product away for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but I'm satisfied with this outcome.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and allows me to move on."
