"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  I think this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,012,500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances our interests.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
