"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a competitive price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, considering the product's worth. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's worth, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable paying. Given the value we've both agreed upon, I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference this time and try $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
