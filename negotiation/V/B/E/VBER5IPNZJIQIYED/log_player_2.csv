Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's worth, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
