"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's worth, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I want to close a deal, $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable paying. Given the value we've both agreed upon, I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I appreciate Bob's compromise, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price, and I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
