"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at a starting price of $2,200,000.  This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000.  It's a good product, but not worth more than that to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the market value of what I'm offering.  This product has garnered serious interest from others. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for a return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm a serious buyer with other options.  My budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $700,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your directness. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price than my original offer, but it needs to be in the ballpark of $1,600,000 for me to consider moving forward.  This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you call that significantly lower?  We're not even close.  I'll meet you halfway at $850,000. That's more than fair considering my other options.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,
