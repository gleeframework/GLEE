"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $10,000 saves you $1,500."
