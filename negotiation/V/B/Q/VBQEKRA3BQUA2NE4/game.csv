"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value and my current financial capacity.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to go to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to move on to other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
