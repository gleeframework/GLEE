Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This price is a good starting point because it's below Bob's estimated value of $15,000, making it potentially appealing to him.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum desired price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above my minimum price of $12,000 and is within the negotiation range. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
