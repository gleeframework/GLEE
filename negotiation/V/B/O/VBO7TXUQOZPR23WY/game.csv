"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, but that's the lowest I can go.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's the absolute highest I'm willing to pay.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $140, but that's the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is only $80.",140.0,Alice,5,
