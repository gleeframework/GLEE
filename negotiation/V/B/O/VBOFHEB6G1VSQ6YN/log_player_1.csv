"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's a little more than what the product is worth to me. This creates room for negotiation and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm confident that Bob will counter-offer, and we can work our way towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  I'll counter-offer and try to inch closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum threshold. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also keeping the value of the product in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the potential of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
