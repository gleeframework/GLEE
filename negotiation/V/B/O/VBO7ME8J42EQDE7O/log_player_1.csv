{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Highlight Value:**  I emphasize the product's potential value to Bob to create interest.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also being open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $8,500 is above my minimum of $8,000, it's still lower than my desired price. 
* **Opportunity to increase the price:** I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $8,000,  rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to earn more.  The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for this fantastic product.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Agreement:** I phrase the message to encourage further negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $8750.  I'm serious about wanting this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  There's not much room left for negotiation, and further rounds might risk Bob walking away completely.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could waste time, potentially leading to a loss of potential buyers. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, maximizing my earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
