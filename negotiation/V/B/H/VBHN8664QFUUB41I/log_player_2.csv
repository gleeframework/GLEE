"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer and try to get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has rejected his counteroffer, and her offer of $10,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to stick with the guaranteed price from John."
