"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere, Alice.  However, to be honest, $11,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could you do $9,500?  That would really help me out.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do a bit better than that. How about $10,200?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make this deal happen, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $9,800. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. If not, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",9900.0,Alice,9,
