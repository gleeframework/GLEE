Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'll be ready to counter his offer if he rejects mine, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $750,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low.  I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is still a good price for Bob since the product is worth $800,000 to him. It's also a fair compromise considering my original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $800,000. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to go lower than my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, the negotiation is taking longer than I'd like, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him.  John is a guaranteed sale at a fair price, and I'm happy to take it."
