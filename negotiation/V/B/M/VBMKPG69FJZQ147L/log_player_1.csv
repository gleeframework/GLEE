Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's a unique piece and I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward. 
* **Optimistic Tone:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, allowing me to end the negotiation with Bob if his offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** Even though Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* **Potentially Higher Price:**  If I can convince Bob to pay closer to my initial asking price, I'll make more money.
* **Backup Plan:** John is a backup, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting more than $12,000 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this deal work. This reflects the unique value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my profit margin.
* **Re-emphasize Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's unique value can justify the higher price.
* **Open Door for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and potentially a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is only $500 less than my previous counter-offer, and it's significantly closer to my goal than John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be stuck with John's offer, which is my absolute minimum.
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation could take more time and there's no guarantee it will result in a better price.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,500, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice in this situation. It ensures a sale at a price that is close to my target and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
