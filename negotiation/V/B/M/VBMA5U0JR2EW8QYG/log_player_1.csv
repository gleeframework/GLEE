Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $9,500, but that's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is a decent deal.  It's more than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my desired price."
