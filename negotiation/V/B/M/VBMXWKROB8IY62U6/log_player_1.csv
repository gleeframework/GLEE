Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking $1,500,000 for it. It's a high price, but I'm confident you'll see the incredible potential it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product with great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to get closer to $1,500,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,350,000?  This reflects the value and potential of the product, and it also allows for some room for you to secure a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more,  $1,300,000 is a good price and it's getting close to my desired range. There's always the risk of further negotiation going south, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a sale altogether."
