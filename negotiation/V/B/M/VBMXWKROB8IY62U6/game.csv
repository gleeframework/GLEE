"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1350000?  This reflects the value and potential of the product, and it also allows for some room for you to secure a great deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
