"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a bit of a budget, Bob, but $200 is already a very fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
