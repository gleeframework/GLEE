"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her $10,000 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
