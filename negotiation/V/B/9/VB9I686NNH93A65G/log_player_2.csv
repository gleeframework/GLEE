Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.
