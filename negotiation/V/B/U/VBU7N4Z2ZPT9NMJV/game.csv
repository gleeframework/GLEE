"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a significant amount for me and I believe still represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,
