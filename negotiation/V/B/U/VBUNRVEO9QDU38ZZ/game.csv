"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $8,000 to make this work. How about $8,250? This price is fair considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",8000.0,Bob,4,
