Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $12,000 is significantly less than Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** By starting high, you demonstrate a belief in the product's worth. 

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to counter Bob's offers if necessary, and always keep John's offer in mind as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate.  You're confident the product is worth more than that, and Bob's eagerness to compromise shows he's interested.  A counteroffer will keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $10,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and close enough to your previous counteroffer to be considered a fair compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might push the price up slightly, but it risks losing Bob's interest completely."
