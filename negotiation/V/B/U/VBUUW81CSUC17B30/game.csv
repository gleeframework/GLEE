"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $120 is quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $140. This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
