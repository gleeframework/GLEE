{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. This can help build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and can potentially secure a better price. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make an offer of $120 for the product. I think it's a more reasonable price, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, given that John is willing to pay $150. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $120 is quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $140. This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $140, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing my need for a higher price.  I'm also trying to frame the offer as a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

By reducing my price slightly and emphasizing the benefits for both of us, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, keeping in mind that John is a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's only $20 away.  Considering that:

* I've already rejected Bob's lower offer and countered, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* John is willing to pay $150, but there's no guarantee he'll be available if I reject Bob's offer.

It's a strategic decision to accept Bob's offer at $130. It secures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation and potential lost time with a possibility of no sale."
