"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum, and it's a fair price for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  It's a fair compromise and still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $11,500? It's a good middle ground, and it allows me to keep the value of the product while still offering you a great deal.  Let's close this deal, I believe we're close!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,250, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,400? It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen in the next few rounds!",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,300, which is a small increase but gets us closer to a deal. With only two rounds left, let's see if we can make this happen!",11300.0,Bob,8,
