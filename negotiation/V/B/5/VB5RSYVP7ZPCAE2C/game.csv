,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this moment. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $100.50. It's still a good deal, and I think it's worth considering.",100.5,Alice,5,
