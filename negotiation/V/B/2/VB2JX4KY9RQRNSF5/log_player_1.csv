Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit. I want to see if he values the product higher than that. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind the $1,000,000 floor from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my first offer, but still above Bob's current proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it still leaves me a decent profit and keeps the negotiation moving forward. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer.  While I could try to counter again, I'm starting to think that getting $100,000 more from John is a better use of my time. I'm going to sell to John."
