"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate with you, Alice. However, I believe $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product extends far beyond its base cost to me.  It holds significant potential for future growth and innovation. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,225,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product has potential for growth and innovation, but I'm still not convinced that $1,225,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that reflects the product's true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards his perceived value, but we're still significantly above your minimum.  We have room to negotiate and the potential to secure a much better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer doesn't reflect the  product's true potential. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose $1,180,000. This recognizes its value while offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I still believe $1,180,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where further negotiation might not yield significant gains. Bob is consistently halving the difference, but we're still above $1 million. It's worth pushing a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,115,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1115000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to signal firmness and set a clear boundary. By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency. We're still aiming for a significantly higher price than John's offer, but we're also acknowledging the need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,115,000, but I'm still not willing to pay that price. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is signaling that he's reached his limit. While we could push further, the risk of him walking away and losing out on a $250,000 profit is too great. Accepting his offer secures a good deal for us and avoids potentially missing out on both Bob and John."
