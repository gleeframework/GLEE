"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is below both our valuation and his own perceived value.  There's room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer to signal that we're aiming higher while still being open to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is undeniably high. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to let it go for $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($750,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, we're subtly reminding Bob of what he stands to gain and justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While our new offer is a significant drop, we're still leaving ourselves space to negotiate further in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for a higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or the negotiations could stall. Accepting now secures a healthy profit.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:** We always had John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net. Since Bob's offer exceeds that, it makes sense to take it."
