"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to earn a significant amount. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price would still allow me to recover a substantial portion of my investment and you would get a great deal on a valuable product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
