"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  While buying from John is more expensive, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Within your budget:**  $700,000 is still well within your budget of $1,500,000.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still space for Alice to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** While buying from John is more expensive, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** This counteroffer is a bit higher than your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise. 
* **Still within your budget:**  $750,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer and well within your budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.** While still higher than your last counteroffer, it's a significant decrease from her initial asking price. 
* **Negotiating further might not yield much more savings.**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to more rounds of back-and-forth, potentially wasting time and potentially leading to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still a more expensive option.**  Accepting Alice's offer is a better deal than buying from John, even though it's not your absolute ideal price."
