"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand its worth to you is $1200000. As the seller, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. After careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market conditions. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
