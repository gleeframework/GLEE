Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and his perceived value.  It's too early to settle for such a low price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000.  I think this is a very fair price and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. If you can't accept this, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
