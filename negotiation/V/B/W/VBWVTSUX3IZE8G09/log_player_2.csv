Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unwilling to go below $100, and has even gone slightly above her last offer.  It's unlikely she'll budge significantly from here.  You can get the product for $100 from John, making it the best option."
