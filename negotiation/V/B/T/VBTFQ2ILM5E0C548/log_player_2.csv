It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You're not desperate yet, and there's a chance you can get it for less than $1,000,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it still leaves room for us both to be happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
