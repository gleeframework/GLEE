Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum desired value ($100) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the product and the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware of John's offer of $100, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. John's offer of $100 provides a strong benchmark.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $90 is closer, I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem fair.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to make my offer more appealing.
* **Openness to Finality:**  The message suggests that I'm open to reaching a final agreement, which might encourage Bob to accept. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, so I have a solid backup if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a lower price.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Selling to John is the most time-efficient option, allowing me to move on without engaging in more rounds of negotiation.

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of getting a price lower than my minimum is too high. John's offer provides a safe and efficient way to maximize my earnings."
