Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price lower, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated Alice down $175,000 from her initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative:** John's offer is only $25,000 less, and you've already invested time in negotiating with Alice. 

While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal."
