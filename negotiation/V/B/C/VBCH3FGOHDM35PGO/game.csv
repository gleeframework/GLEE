"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price lower, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
