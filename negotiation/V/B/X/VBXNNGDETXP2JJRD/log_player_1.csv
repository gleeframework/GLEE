{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I have a floor of $10,000 from John. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some leverage and is more likely to engage. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to create interest and make him think about its worth to him.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for it. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my floor price:**  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, or that I could get a higher offer in a subsequent counter-offer. 
* **No immediate urgency:** I have a guaranteed sale with John, so I don't need to accept Bob's offer immediately.

By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go below $12,000 at this time. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than his. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the uniqueness and value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I use an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation and allow Bob to propose a counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation ongoing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the uniqueness of the product, but based on my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $12000. Could we possibly negotiate towards $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my floor:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  I've already lowered my price once and it's likely Bob won't budge much further.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I'd be left with only the $10,000 offer from John.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of getting nothing."
