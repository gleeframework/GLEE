"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a win-win for both of us, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This still allows you a healthy profit and is within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
