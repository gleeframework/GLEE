"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me. While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're still too far from Bob's perceived value. While $1,250,000 is a significant amount, accepting now would mean losing out on a potential $250,000 or more. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. However,  $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to us both, I propose $1,600,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you consider $1,350,000?  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. At this stage, accepting his offer would mean a loss of $150,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
