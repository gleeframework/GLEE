"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me. While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. However,  $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to us both, I propose $1,600,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you consider $1,350,000?  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
