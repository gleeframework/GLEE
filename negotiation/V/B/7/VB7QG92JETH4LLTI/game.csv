"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding my value for the product. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your position. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're able to meet me in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
