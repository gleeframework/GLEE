Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to take Bob's offer and avoid further negotiation,  I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $14,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his price. Since John is also willing to pay $12,000, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's best to sell to John and secure the sale."
