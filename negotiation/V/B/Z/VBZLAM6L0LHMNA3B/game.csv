"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own costs and value the product at a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my best price for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your minimum price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway in the last round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'll make one more concession: I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services worth $50,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $1,100,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000, and include the $50,000 in services for free. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
