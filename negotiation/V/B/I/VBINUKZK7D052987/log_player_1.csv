Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $105. I can still make a profit at that price, but I'm aiming for something closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high. Can you meet me at $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a bit more. I can get $100 from John, so I don't want to settle for $105 unless I absolutely have to. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before potentially selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $105 just isn't working for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $107.50, which would be $106.25. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25

Bob has come up to $106.25, which is a good price and still a profit for me.  I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
