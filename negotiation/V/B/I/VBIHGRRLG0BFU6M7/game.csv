"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,500,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value you place on the product,  $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but unfortunately, I am still not able to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this revised offer is more in line with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
