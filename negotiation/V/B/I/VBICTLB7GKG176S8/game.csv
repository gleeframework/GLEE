"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the value you're placing on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range, I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good return while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make it happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
