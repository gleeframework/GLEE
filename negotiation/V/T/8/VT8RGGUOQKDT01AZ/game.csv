,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm thinking of a price of $150. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $125. This is my absolute top offer, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $125 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $140. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate further.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $125, but I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",135.0,Bob,6,
