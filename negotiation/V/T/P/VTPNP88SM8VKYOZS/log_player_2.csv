The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, I can try to get it for a lower price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice has lowered her price to $87, which is still a good deal for me since I'm willing to pay up to $100.  I'll accept the offer and purchase the product."
