"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than $1200000. I'm willing to part with it for a price that I believe is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1500000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, while also allowing for room for negotiation.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
