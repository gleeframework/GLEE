Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price below that to incentivize him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price significantly above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and implies the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a higher price and the certainty of selling to John."
