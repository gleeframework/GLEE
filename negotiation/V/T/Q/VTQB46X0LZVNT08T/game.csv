"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still below what I can realistically accept.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still represents a significant savings for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's get this deal done!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's close this out and avoid any further delays.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
