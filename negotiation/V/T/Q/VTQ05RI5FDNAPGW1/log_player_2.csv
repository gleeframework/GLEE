"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be very beneficial for your business. I'm asking for $950,000 for it, reflecting its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value while still being within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob wants to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $890,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm still confident in the value of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is just slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to purchase from John at $800,000 is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
