Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with an offer higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we want to maximize profit, we also want to offer a price that's enticing enough for Bob to consider. $11,500 is a significant markup from his perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for him to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  We know we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so we shouldn't go below that price in our negotiations with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How we proceed will depend on Bob's response. We can always negotiate down if needed, but we've anchored the negotiation at a point favorable to us."
