"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'll also be prepared to accept John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm hoping for, but it's still closer to my minimum than John's offer. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500. This is still significantly higher than John's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $9,000. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price range, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try to get a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $10,000. This is a slight compromise, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
