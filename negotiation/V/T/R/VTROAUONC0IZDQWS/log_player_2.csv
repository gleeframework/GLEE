"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is a perfect match for your needs. Given its high value to us, we're willing to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $1300000. We understand its worth to you might be higher, but we hope this offer presents a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her product's worth to her but still within your acceptable range. However, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price is fair given your value for it, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $1250000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our valuation and your willingness to pay, aiming for a mutually satisfactory outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,250,000, which is still within your budget and closer to your desired price of $1,100,000.  Accepting this offer means you save $50,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers and ultimately forcing you to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
