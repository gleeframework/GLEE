"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a bold move, but it's a reasonable starting point given that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  This gives Alice a chance to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is only a slight improvement over her previous offer. Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price point.  While buying from John for $15,000 is always an option, it's still not the most favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His previous offer of $9000 was rejected, so he's increasing his offer to $10,000. This is still significantly lower than Alice's $12,500 offer, but it shows that he is willing to negotiate and meet her halfway. This gives Alice a good opportunity to close the deal, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if she wants to push for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
