{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $13,500 is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to find a price that works for both parties.

By starting with a slightly higher price and framing it as a win-win scenario, you create an opportunity for Bob to negotiate while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value. You're better off trying to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a price closer to your $15,000 valuation. 

* **Why not accept?**  Accepting Bob's offer means you'd be selling for less than your minimum, leaving money on the table. 
* **Why not sell to John?** You have a chance to get a better price from Bob, and the negotiation process is still ongoing.  There's no guarantee that John will still be interested if you wait too long.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's higher than his offer but still within his range of acceptability."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above his price point. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message frames the price as ""fair"" for both parties. This emphasizes the win-win potential of the deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving you room to potentially negotiate further. 

By keeping the offer close to Bob's but maintaining your desired profit, you aim to secure a deal that meets both your and Bob's needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? That's as close as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You have a few reasons to reject this offer:

* **Potential for Better Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. You can try to get closer to your $15,000 target by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum.  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's not worth risking losing the chance for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's stated his limit, try a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $13,000. You could frame it as a final offer or as a compromise to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I'm trying to be reasonable.  How about $13,000? It's just a little higher than your offer, but it's the best I can do. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is framed as a final offer to encourage Bob to accept. It indicates a willingness to compromise, but also sets a firm limit.
* **Focus on Closing:** The message emphasizes the desire to ""make this deal happen."" It creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to finalize the transaction.
* **Small Increment:** The price is slightly higher than Bob's offer but still within his potential range. It's a minimal increase designed to incentivize Bob to accept without pushing him away.

By using a final offer strategy and emphasizing the desire to reach an agreement, you hope to convince Bob to accept your counteroffer and close the deal at a price that's closer to your desired value."
