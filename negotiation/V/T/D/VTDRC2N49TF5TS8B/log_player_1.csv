Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept it and make some money, it's not worth sacrificing the potential for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a higher offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already spent two rounds negotiating and haven't been able to secure a higher price.  John is offering the same amount, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
