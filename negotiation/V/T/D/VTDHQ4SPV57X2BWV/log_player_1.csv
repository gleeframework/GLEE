I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit above my minimum value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will counter-offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counter-offers again."
