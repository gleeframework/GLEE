Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive price for its worth."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information about his level of interest and his perceived value of the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to sell below her minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust her asking price based on his response and the negotiation dynamics."
