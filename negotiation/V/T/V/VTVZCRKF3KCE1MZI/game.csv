"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to come in a bit lower. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
