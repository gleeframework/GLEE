"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have a clear upper limit of $1,200,000 with John, so you have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to come in a bit lower. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $825,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential benefit of squeezing out a few more dollars."
