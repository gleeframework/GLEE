# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer. There's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money. It's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000, which is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is within your budget and is getting closer to your desired price.  While you could try to counteroffer again, it's risky. If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  

This offer is a good compromise, allowing you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
