Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start things off, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it holds.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
