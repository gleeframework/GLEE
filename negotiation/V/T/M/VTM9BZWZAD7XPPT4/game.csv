"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start things off, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it holds.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,110,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,080,000, which is a reasonable price for the product's value.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position and am willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,095,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,095,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a reduction. How about we settle at $1,090,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
