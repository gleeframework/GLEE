{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to its perceived worth. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $95 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $100 to him.  I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a middle ground. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
