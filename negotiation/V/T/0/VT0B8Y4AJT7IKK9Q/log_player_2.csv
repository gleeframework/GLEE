Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, so how about we try $937,500?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but in smaller increments now.  The potential savings from further haggling are getting smaller. 
* **Time is Money:** Each round spent negotiating is an opportunity cost. You could be using this time to implement the product and see its benefits.
* **Solid Deal:** $937,500 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. 

While there's a slim chance you could get it cheaper, accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away later."
