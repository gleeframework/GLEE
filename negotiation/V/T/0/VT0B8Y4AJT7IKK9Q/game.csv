"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $900,000 for this product.  If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can see the value of the product is clear to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is close, but I need to stay disciplined with my budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, so how about we try $937,500?",937500.0,Alice,7,
