"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
