Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have a strong fallback position. Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially maximize your profit if Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high starting price gives you room to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Psychological Impact:** A higher initial offer can make Bob perceive the product as more valuable.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there is a calculated risk involved in aiming higher."
