"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a potential profit margin.
* **Framing:**  The message highlights the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Openness:**  The message also invites Bob to share his thoughts, creating a sense of collaboration.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can still sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk by rejecting Bob's offer. 

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't accept $750,000.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Maintain Profit:**  This price still allows me to profit from the sale while being more realistic than my initial offer.
* **Show Flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to reciprocate. 

**Next Step:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially push him closer to my desired price.
* **John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John for $800,000 is still a viable option if we don't reach an agreement.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap while staying above my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go below $800,000. This is my absolute minimum price considering the value of this product. I hope you understand. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my absolute minimum price, making it clear that I won't budge further. This shows determination but also fairness, as it's my floor price. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him into accepting my price.
* **No Compromise:**  At this point, I'm not willing to compromise further. 

**Next Step:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $800,000."
