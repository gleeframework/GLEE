"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1050000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a decent profit.  It's unlikely we'll get a better offer from Bob in future rounds.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize my earnings in this scenario."
