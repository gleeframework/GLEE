"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's still a significant savings compared to buying from John and represents a fair price considering the product's value to you. There's always a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially increasing the price is too high.  It's better to secure the deal at this price and avoid the uncertainty."
