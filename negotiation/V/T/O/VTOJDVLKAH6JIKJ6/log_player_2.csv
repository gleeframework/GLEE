Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to sell at $120, Bob. I think I can do better than that. How about we try $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for Bob, especially with the limited rounds remaining. The negotiation is going in the wrong direction, and there's a risk of getting stuck in a stalemate.  Therefore, Bob chooses to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring he gets a good deal without further risk."
