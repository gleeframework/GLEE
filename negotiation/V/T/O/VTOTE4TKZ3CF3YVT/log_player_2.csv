"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown flexibility.  There's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is tempting, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to compromise and Alice has shown flexibility.  It's worth trying to get a price closer to his $9,750 counteroffer."
