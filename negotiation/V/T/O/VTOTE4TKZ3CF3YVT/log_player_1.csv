"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly hinting at the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  I'm setting a high starting price because I know John is a backup option, providing a safety net. However, I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price, especially since Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob.

**Next Step:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Middle Ground:** $10,500 is a fair midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Value Reminder:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to keep the negotiation focused on a higher price. 
* **Direct Question:** Ending with a direct question encourages a response and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Important Note:**  I'm still aware of the potential to sell to John, but I'm pushing for a better price with Bob. This counteroffer shows flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another round.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm still comfortable taking a calculated risk to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $10,000 and $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm showing further flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $10,250 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm ending with a clear call to action to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is a calculated move. It's a significant concession, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects it again.  I'm aware that selling to John is a safe option, but I'm committed to maximizing my profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering we're both trying to meet in the middle.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $250 away from my last offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. There's only a $250 gap, and Bob seems committed to closing the deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While selling to John is always a safe option, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price close to $10,000.  I will emphasize the value of the product and the fact that we are getting closer to an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to meet you in the middle.  Let's close this deal at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise to show my commitment to reaching a deal. $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting the fact that $10,000 is a fair price for both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and encourages him to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using strong language like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a risky move. I'm sacrificing a bit of my profit, but I believe the likelihood of Bob accepting this final offer is high. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John, but I'm giving Bob one last chance to get the product at a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,875. This is a fair price, considering the negotiations we've had. Let's close this deal and call it a day. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Bob's offer is only $125 away from my minimum acceptable price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We're now in Round 8, and I only have 2 rounds left. If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk of not reaching an agreement and losing the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Profit Maximization:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $7,000, which is a substantial amount.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking the deal with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  I've reached a point where the potential gains from continued negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not closing a deal.  Selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision at this time."
