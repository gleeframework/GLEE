"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, but Alice's offer is $1,450,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.  Even though you would save money by accepting Alice's offer, it is still more expensive than your target of $1,500,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price with John or find another seller."
