{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for the product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's not entirely unreasonable. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your profit margin and the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $8,500. This price respects both our financial needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer and is still within my acceptable range.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk him walking away entirely or prolonging the negotiation."
