"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll consider a price of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,,
