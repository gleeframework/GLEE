"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8750?  I'm confident this is a fair price, and it gives you a chance to acquire a valuable product.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $7250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $8250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
