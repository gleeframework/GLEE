"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
This is a good starting point. While $1,100,000 is a somewhat reasonable offer, there's room for negotiation to get closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($900,000), we establish a strong bargaining position and leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  Alice's value is $1,200,000, and your maximum is $1,000,000. This offer leaves a decent margin for potential compromises.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and still within your stated value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting or trying to buy from John, as they are both offering the same price. Take the deal!"
