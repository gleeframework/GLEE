Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above Alice's minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is the only other one) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification for Price:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value, using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the idea of a premium product worth a higher price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  She knows her walk-away price ($800,000 from John), which gives her leverage. 
* **Understanding Bob:**  If Alice had more information about Bob's negotiating style or financial situation, she could tailor her offer more effectively."
