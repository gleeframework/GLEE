Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value but still gives me a profit well above my minimum.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to negotiate by asking for his thoughts on the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to counter if needed, but I'm confident that my initial offer is attractive enough to start the negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $10,000 gives me the confidence to be firm during negotiations."
