{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Framing:** I'm using friendly language to open the negotiation and emphasize a potential mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves room for me to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I'll be prepared to accept a counteroffer if it's reasonable, or make another counteroffer if necessary. However, I'll keep the minimum price I'm willing to accept in mind ($150) and also consider if it's worth it to continue negotiating or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I need to make it worthwhile. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer of $150. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $130, but I'll be willing to negotiate further if needed. I'll continue to monitor the situation and decide when it's best to either accept Bob's offer, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $120. I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $120 splits the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive and friendly language to encourage further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for a potential final counteroffer:**  I expect Bob may make one final counteroffer. I'll be prepared to accept a price close to $120, but I'll also be prepared to reject and sell to John if necessary.
* **Monitor the situation:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response and decide whether to accept his offer, make a final counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I would like to propose a final price of $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:** While I could try to negotiate a slightly higher price, I don't think Bob is likely to budge further.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer of $150.

**Next Steps:**  

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $110. While it's not ideal, it's still a reasonable profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
