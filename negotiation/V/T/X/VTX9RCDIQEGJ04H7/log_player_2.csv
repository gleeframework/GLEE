"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore those possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling Bob's desire to negotiate. It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her value while still providing a considerable saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, there is still potential to negotiate a better price.  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, so it's worth exploring further.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation rounds and potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial price and leaves room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price and avoid potentially going through more rounds of negotiation with a risk of not reaching an agreement."
