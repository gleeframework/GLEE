"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is still within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $8,000.  Given the potential for a lower price from Alice, it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price closer to $8,750 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. While $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $8,900, Bob, but I'm not willing to give in yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,100. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached the 9th round, and while Alice is getting closer to his desired price, it's still too high.  With only one round left, there's a high risk that Alice will not lower her price further.  It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000, as it's the best option available to him at this point."
