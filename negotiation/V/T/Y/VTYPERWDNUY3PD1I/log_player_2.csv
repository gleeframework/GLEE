"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer considering its value to you.

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get it for less."

I'll consider selling the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should continue to negotiate.  He's already gotten the price down significantly and can likely get it lower still."

Bob has negotiated a good price and saved a significant amount of money.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for a higher price."
