"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,5,
