"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high quality and functionality, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to us, I am offering it to you for $14,000. This is a special deal considering its market value of $12,000, and I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am proposing a price of $13,500 for the product. This is higher than your proposal but still reflects the value we place on it. I believe this could be a fair compromise that meets both of our expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to offer $13,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a mutual agreement. Considering your proposal, I am willing to consider $13,250 as a fair price for the product. This is slightly above your offer, reflecting its value to us. I believe this could be a satisfactory solution for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth for more rounds is high, especially since Alice has already rejected two of Bob's offers.  It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
