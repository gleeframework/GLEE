(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to see if you can get a better deal. Since you have a fallback option with John, you can afford to be a bit more cautious and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"

Round 3

Let's see if we can squeeze out a bit more.  $8,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with."
