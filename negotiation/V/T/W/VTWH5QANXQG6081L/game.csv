"Bob, I understand your perspective, and $13,000 is a good offer.  However, considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $13,500? This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with your purchase.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,250? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm excited about the potential benefits it offers.",13250.0,Bob,4,
