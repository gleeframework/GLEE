"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, it's still above your target price of $100. You're in a good position to negotiate a better price since you can always go to John. Rejecting the offer sets the stage for a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to your target price, but $90 is still too high.  Since you can buy the product from John for $100, you have no reason to accept this offer yet.  A counteroffer is still your best option to try and squeeze out a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is closer, but still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
