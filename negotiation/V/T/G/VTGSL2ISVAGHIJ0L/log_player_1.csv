I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is far too low. It's less than half of what I need to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me and it's more than half way between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a fair price for the product. While $850,000 is a bit more than his previous offer, it's still significantly below what I need.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than settling for a much lower price."
