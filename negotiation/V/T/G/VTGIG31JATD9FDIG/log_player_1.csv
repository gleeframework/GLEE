Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $925,000 is a good price and significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  It's important to be realistic and close the deal when I have a strong offer."
