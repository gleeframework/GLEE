"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
