"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm excited about the potential of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
