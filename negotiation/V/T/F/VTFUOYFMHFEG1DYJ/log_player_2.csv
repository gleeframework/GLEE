"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's a significant investment, but it's worth every penny. I believe this product can be incredibly valuable to you and your business. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be happy to sell it to another buyer for the same price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. While she presents it confidently, stating she has other buyers, you have a guaranteed option with John at the same price.  There's no reason to accept immediately. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her reducing the price to secure the sale over potentially losing you to another buyer."
