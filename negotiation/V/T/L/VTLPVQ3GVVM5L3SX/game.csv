"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my value.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our goals. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10500, which is a good middle ground.  If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
