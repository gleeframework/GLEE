"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to go that low?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
