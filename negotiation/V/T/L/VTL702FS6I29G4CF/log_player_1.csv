Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still within my desired price range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a little less than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, so I've left some wiggle room. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value for Bob to make the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  If Bob counteroffers, I'll consider his offer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **John's Offer:** If the negotiations with Bob stall, I can always accept John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's still a starting point for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer of $10,000 as a backup option, so I can afford to be firm with Bob and potentially walk away if the negotiations don't go in my favor.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal for him, and highlighting the fact that I'm making a significant concession.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll sell him the product.
* **Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or walk away and accept John's offer."
