"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left to try and get a deal closer to your desired price point.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice before going that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. This establishes a clear baseline and hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above my desired price point. While it's closer to my budget, I still have rounds left to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal. I'll continue to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $250,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. My hope is that this counteroffer will encourage Alice to come down further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm confident that with some further negotiation, I can secure a better deal.  I still have 5 rounds to go, and I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves me with less negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by only $50,000. I'm trying to signal to Alice that I'm getting close to my limit but still have room for compromise.  My goal is to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us, and I believe this offer positions us well for a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
