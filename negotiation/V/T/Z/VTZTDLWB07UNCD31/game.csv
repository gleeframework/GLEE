"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $120, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $155. It's a fair price that's closer to my original price, and I think you'll still get a great deal!",155.0,Alice,5,
