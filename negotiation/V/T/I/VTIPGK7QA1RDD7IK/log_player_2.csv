"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. How about we meet in the middle at $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we're aiming to create room for negotiation and understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message is still polite and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning a ""limited budget"" provides a reason for the counteroffer without revealing our absolute maximum price.

This strategy aims to find a price that works for both parties while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved towards a compromise, $9,000 is still above our maximum budget of $8,000 and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There might be room for further negotiation. Alice seems willing to compromise, so we can try to nudge the price closer to our desired range. 

Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm definitely interested in finding a way to make this work. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product today."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Down:** We're getting closer to our budget and John's price with this counteroffer, putting some pressure on Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding ""today"" implies we're ready to close the deal if the price is right, which might encourage Alice to agree. 
* **Continuing Positive Tone:** We're still maintaining a collaborative and appreciative tone to encourage a deal. 

This offer aims to balance getting a good price with increasing the chance of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $7,000 and my initial offer of $12,000. How about we try $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not Budging:** Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 shows she's not willing to negotiate within a reasonable range of our budget or John's offer. 
* **Wasting Time:**  Further negotiation is likely to be fruitless and just waste time.  
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  John provides a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is within our budget.

It's clear that reaching a deal with Alice is unlikely to get us a better price than John's offer. It's time to move on and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
