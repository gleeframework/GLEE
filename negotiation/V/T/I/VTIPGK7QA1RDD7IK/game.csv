"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. How about we meet in the middle at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm definitely interested in finding a way to make this work. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product today.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $7,000 and my initial offer of $12,000. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
