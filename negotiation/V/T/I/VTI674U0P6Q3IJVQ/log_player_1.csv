Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach that point within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal."
