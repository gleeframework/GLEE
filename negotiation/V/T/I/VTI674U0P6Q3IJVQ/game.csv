"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal.  While $2,000,000 represents a fair price given the product's potential, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
