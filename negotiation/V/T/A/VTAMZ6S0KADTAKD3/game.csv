"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its unique qualities, $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. This is still a great value considering its worth to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is a fair price that is within my budget and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
