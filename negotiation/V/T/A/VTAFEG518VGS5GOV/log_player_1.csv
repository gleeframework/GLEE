"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This sets a high starting point for negotiations and leaves room for potential compromise. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not afraid to be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time by a larger margin. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm still confident in the product's value. I believe this is a good middle ground that might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is now at my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before I resort to selling to John. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can close the deal closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm pushing for a slightly higher price than Bob's offer. This is a compromise, but I'm still within my acceptable range, and it leaves room for Bob to potentially accept.  With only a few rounds left, I want to test if this small increase will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, which I don't want to go below. It is also likely that Bob will not budge much further. Given the limited rounds remaining, I believe it's time to secure the deal with John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me a higher profit than I can currently obtain from Bob."
