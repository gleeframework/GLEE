"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This allows you a good profit margin and offers me a significant saving. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however, and come down to $950000. This price allows you a considerable saving compared to your initial value estimate and ensures I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.",950000.0,Alice,3,
