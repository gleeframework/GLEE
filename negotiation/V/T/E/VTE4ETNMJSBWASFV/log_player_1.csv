Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special discounted price of $14,500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 is a strong starting point:
    * It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
    * It's close enough to John's offer that we don't risk losing out on a sale.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""special discounted price"" to make the offer more enticing."
