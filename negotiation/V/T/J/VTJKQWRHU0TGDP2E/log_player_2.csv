You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small reduction.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
