Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,500,000 while still being attractive to Bob.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000. While it is tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to potentially make a decent profit and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to come up a little from his initial offer.  If he doesn't, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is simply too low.  It's getting close to my minimum of $1,500,000, but the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially resulting in an even lower price isn't worth it.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
