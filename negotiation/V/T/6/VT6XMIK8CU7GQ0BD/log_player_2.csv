"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value ($1,200,000) but lower than your maximum price ($1,500,000). It's in your best interest to negotiate further and try to get a lower price. There's room for both of you to gain more in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as I can.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and it gives us both a great opportunity to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product's value justifies this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is exactly her value for the product.  This means there's no further room for negotiation to lower the price.  Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price."
