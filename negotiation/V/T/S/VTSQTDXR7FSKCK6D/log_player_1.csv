Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $20,000.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:** I don't know Bob's value for the product, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $15,000.  By starting at $20,000, I leave room for negotiation if he's interested but thinks the price is too high.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have John who will buy it for $15,000, so I'm not risking losing money. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still guaranteeing a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
