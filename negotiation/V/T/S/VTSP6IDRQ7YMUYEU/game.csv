"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Would you be interested in considering this price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can do $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, but I need to stick to my budget.  My absolute max is $13,200.  If that works, we have a deal.",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,200, but I need to make a small profit. I can do $13,250, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,
