"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $14,000. This is a competitive price that I'm willing to offer you, and I think you'll find it's a great value considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and knows you're willing to spend up to $15,000.  By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price."
