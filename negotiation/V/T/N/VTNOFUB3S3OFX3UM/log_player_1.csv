"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $200 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common practice to start high in negotiations, especially when you don't know the buyer's valuation. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I've provided a brief justification for the price to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open Ended Question:** I've ended with an open ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially engage in a dialogue. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adapt my strategy depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's initial response indicates he is interested in the product, so there's potential for further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I will try to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175, considering your interest.  Would you be able to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial asking price but still well above my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to Interest:** I reiterate Bob's interest in the product to emphasize that I value his business.
* **""Meet Me Halfway"":**  This phrase encourages Bob to consider a middle ground and allows for potential further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will closely watch Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or willingness to accept this price. I will remain firm on my minimum price of $150 and will continue to negotiate strategically to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price Reached:** Bob's offer of $150 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Upside:** There's no significant benefit to continuing the negotiation, as further rounds might risk Bob withdrawing his offer entirely.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already on round 4, and time is running out. Accepting this offer secures a guaranteed sale.

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally want to get a higher price,  accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most practical and financially sound decision. It ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
