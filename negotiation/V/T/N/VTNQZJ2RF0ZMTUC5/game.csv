"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below my minimum value and gives you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $12,000. This would be a great price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
