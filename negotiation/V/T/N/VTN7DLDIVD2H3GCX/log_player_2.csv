Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us both, $1,250,000 is still below my acceptable threshold.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  So my final offer is $1,325,000. This provides you considerable savings compared to the other offer, and it ensures the product finds a good home.  What do you say?
