Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't know his absolute limit.  Starting extremely high allows for negotiation downward.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and possibly overpay.
* **Backup Plan:**  The guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000 gives us a strong fallback position. This allows for a bold initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will be completely turned off by the high price and walk away. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
