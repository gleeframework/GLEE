"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, as it aligns better with my value assessment. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but it's a more reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer to my range, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer at $1,700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
