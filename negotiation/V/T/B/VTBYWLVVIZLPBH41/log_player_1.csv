Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, as it aligns better with my value assessment. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but it's a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
