Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but also demonstrates the value I place on the product. I'm confident I can get at least $800,000 from John if this negotiation fails, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I'm closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing this deal to get a few more dollars. This is a good outcome, considering the initial negotiation."
