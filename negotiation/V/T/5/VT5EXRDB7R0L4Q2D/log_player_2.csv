It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $15,000.  It makes more sense to counteroffer or go with John."

I'm offering $8,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also demonstrates my commitment to getting a good deal."

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price than her last offer."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable paying.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John and get the product for my maximum price."
