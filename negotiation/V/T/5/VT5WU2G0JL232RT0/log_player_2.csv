"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, so there's room to bargain. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? This would still represent a significant savings for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate.  He can likely get the price down further. While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer,  it's not the best possible deal for Bob. He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target of $1,200,000."
