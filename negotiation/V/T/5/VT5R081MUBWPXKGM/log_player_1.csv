"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both your minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By framing the price as reflective of the product's ""true value and potential,"" we aim to shift the focus away from Bob's immediate valuation.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and accept John's offer if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to go.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, there's still a lot of room for negotiation. You have the leverage of John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if you can get closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, but I believe it still represents a fair price for the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're making a large decrease from our initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, we remain well above both your minimum and Bob's offer, maintaining room for negotiation.
* **Framing and Justification:** We're highlighting the concession to make Bob feel valued, while reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We haven't significantly budged towards Bob's offer, encouraging him to make a more substantial move in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. While $1,900,000 is better, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be open to $1,250,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but you still have room to negotiate. He's moving in the right direction, but accepting $1,250,000 would be leaving money on the table, especially considering your alternative option with John. Let's counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This price reflects my desire to strike a deal while recognizing the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise, which can be a powerful negotiating tactic. It makes it seem like you're making a significant concession (which you are, to an extent).
* **Above the Minimum, Below the Ask:** This price point keeps us comfortably above your absolute minimum while still being below Bob's initial offer. It maintains the pressure for him to move closer to your range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We continue to subtly remind Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  How about $1,400,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value you place on the product while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now very close to your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000).  While you could try to push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate."
