(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is only $50,000 over his maximum, it's still above his desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price point. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further, as Alice might not budge and Bob could end up buying from John at the same price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum price."
