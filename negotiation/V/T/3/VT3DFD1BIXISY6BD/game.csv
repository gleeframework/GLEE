"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $11,350. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
