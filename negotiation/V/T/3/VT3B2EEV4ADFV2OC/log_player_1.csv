"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to maximize my earnings. I'm also being friendly and trying to build rapport to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $7,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's worth closing the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

I'm still trying to get a higher price, but I'm also showing willingness to compromise to avoid reaching a stalemate. I'm emphasizing fairness and offering a compromise to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $7,500. That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows I'm serious about buying.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, the negotiation is taking longer than I anticipated. I'm concerned that I might not be able to reach a satisfactory price with Bob within the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than to risk losing money with Bob."
