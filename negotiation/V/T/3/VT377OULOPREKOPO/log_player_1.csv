"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm countering with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also not willing to accept his lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still a chance he'll come closer to my desired price, and selling to John is a last resort if I can't find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a decent offer, I still believe I can get a better price.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap.  Selling to John is still an option if this round doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price one last time to show Bob my sincerity.  I'm hoping this is enough to get him to accept, but if not, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $130, which is more than what John is offering.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm confident I can't get a better offer from Bob. It's better to accept his offer and sell the product than to risk losing both Bob and John."
