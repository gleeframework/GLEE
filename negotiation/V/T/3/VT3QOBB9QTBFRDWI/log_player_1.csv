Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,500,000, so I won't accept anything lower.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to be realistic and offer a price he might consider.
* **Negotiation room:**  I'm offering $1,400,000, which leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's also closer to my minimum than to his maximum.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high offer, I aim to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and make a new one, if necessary.  Ultimately, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also significantly below the initial offer I made, which means he's not showing much willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, so I have a guaranteed alternative.
* **Potential for improvement:** While Bob's offer is low, I can potentially negotiate a better price with him. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This gives me a chance to see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to earn at least $1,500,000. 
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $900,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a compromise. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is still a backup option, giving me leverage in this negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

By offering $1,200,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, while still remaining firm on my desire for a higher price. This approach aims to find a middle ground that works for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Although Bob has increased his offer, he's not willing to meet my minimum, and further negotiation might not be fruitful. 
* **John's offer:** John is offering my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing me a sale at my desired value.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. John offers a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirements.  It's time to secure the sale with John and move on."
