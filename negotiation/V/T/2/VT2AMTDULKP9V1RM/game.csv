"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'd accept $1,400,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,300,000? I feel that's a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
