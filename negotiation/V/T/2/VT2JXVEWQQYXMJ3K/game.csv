"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know is of great value to your business. Based on its potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This price still provides you with significant savings compared to your initial assessment and allows me to reach a figure closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be flexible, and I appreciate that. However, $875,000 still doesn't quite cover my minimum. How about we meet at $890,000? That's a significant amount for you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
