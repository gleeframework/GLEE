"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price of $1,250,000. It's a significant value at this price, considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts, as I have another interested buyer prepared to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better deal from John."
