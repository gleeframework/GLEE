"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This would give you a great product at a fair price, and I'd still be making a reasonable profit.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about we meet at $9,750? That's the closest I can get to my target of $8,000 without going too low",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,900, which is a great compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's seal the deal!",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,900. I'll meet you at $9,700, but that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you",9700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is my final offer. This is a fair price for the product, and it allows both of us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen!",9800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,500. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. This is my final offer",9500.0,Bob,10,
