"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for your product. It's a fair price, considering my needs and the value you place on it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
