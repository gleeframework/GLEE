Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob that it is worth the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, implying you might be open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the conversation. Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for a counter-offer that could still be more profitable than your guaranteed $12,000 from John."
