Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  While I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us, $1,300,000 falls short of what I had in mind. Would you consider $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this unique product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I've been giving this some thought, and to demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While $1,600,000 is getting closer, it's still above my limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if we can reach a compromise closer to $1,400,000."
