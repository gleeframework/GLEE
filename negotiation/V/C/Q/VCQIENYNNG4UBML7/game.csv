"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  While I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us, $1,300,000 falls short of what I had in mind. Would you consider $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this unique product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm confident this product holds significant value, but I can't justify going above $1,400,000 at this time. Let's continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I've been giving this some thought, and to demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value this product,  $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000, which represents a significant investment on my part. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
