"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to consider this deal. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows you a considerable profit margin and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make one final concession to ensure a deal, but I can only go down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. If you're truly interested, this is the final price I can offer. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a decision based on this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
