"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to consider this deal. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows you a considerable profit margin and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make one final concession to ensure a deal, but I can only go down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. If you're truly interested, this is the final price I can offer.
