Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to consider this deal. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows you a considerable profit margin and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if he rejects that, I'll sell to John to ensure I get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make one final concession to ensure a deal, but I can only go down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. If you're truly interested, this is the final price I can offer. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a decision based on this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price,  it's getting closer to my minimum.  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, he might walk away entirely.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to start over with John.  $1,200,000 is a good enough outcome considering the time constraints."
