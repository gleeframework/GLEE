"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, but not too far off. This should give me room to negotiate, while still being enticing enough to motivate Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer, and it still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting it. It's also getting late in the game, and I'm happy to take the $7,800."
