{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $800,000.  $950,000 is too high, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer was still too high, but this counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying and is willing to pay a significant amount. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for both parties to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing the process."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This price is closer to Alice's likely minimum but still within Bob's budget.  It's a reasonable compromise that might push Alice to accept."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $800,000. While it's still slightly higher, accepting this offer is the best option considering:

* **Limited Rounds:**  There are only 5 rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safety net, but it's important to consider the time and potential risk associated with switching to a new seller. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might increase her price again in future rounds, potentially exceeding the $800,000 threshold.

Overall, accepting Alice's offer in this round ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further risk."
