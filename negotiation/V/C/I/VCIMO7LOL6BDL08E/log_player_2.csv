Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $9,750. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $9,600. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9600}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. However, I'm willing to make another slight concession. I'll meet you at $9,700. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left.  Alice is showing a reluctance to go below $9,700.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  With each round, the potential savings get smaller.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get Alice to accept a price below $9,500.
* **Guaranteed price:** John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is Bob's maximum. 

By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids risking further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
