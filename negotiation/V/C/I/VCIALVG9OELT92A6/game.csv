"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Its value is undeniable and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to make this work.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still quite a bit above my budget. I could potentially stretch to $750,000.  Do you think we could make that work?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
