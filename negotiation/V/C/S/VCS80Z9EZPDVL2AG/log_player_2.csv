"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($110):** You save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **John's Offer ($120):** This is your maximum budget, so you save nothing. 

Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product for a good price and saves you money."
