"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let's work together to make this happen.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're showing flexibility.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to get a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe we can both be satisfied with this outcome.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this now.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
