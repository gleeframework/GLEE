"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is more than the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I could try to negotiate further, but there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I'm already at the minimum I want.  There's also a risk that I might lose the deal completely. It's better to accept the offer and guarantee the sale."
