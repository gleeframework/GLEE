"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we compromise at $1,050,000? That's still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. That's still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
