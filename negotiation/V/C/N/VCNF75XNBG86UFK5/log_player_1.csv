Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,200,000. I believe I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference: $1,175,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. "", ""product_price"": 1175000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept at this point, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I have a few more rounds to work with."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,156,000 is very close to my minimum, I only have two rounds left.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is secure and meets my minimum price.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
