"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount.  While I value this at no less than $1200000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a price that reflects its potential value, but also allows for a fair margin for you.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this product, but if you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
