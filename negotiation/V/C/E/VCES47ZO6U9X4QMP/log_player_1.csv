"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell for my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to move a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135.  This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I hope this will entice him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $5 less than my initial offer and  higher than my minimum. It's getting close to a point where the negotiation is taking a lot of time and I'm not sure if I can get much more.  Therefore, I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
