Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special, and I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To start, I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price.  Selling to John would guarantee a profit, but I believe there's potential to do better with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm not yet willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I will counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap and come to an agreement that satisfies both of us."

Round 6

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me.

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm only one round away from selling to John for $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer one last time, hoping to secure a deal that's closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
