"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special, and I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To start, I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a win. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is closer to my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  I know you value the product, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
