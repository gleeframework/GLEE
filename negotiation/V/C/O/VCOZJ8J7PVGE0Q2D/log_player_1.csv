Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with a price of $120. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this encourages Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $105 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's a good deal considering that John is only willing to pay $100."
