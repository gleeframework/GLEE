"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and I'm confident it would provide a lot of value to you. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is still a little steep for me though. How about $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I can come down a bit further, but $95 is still less than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me at $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
