"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  You always have the option to buy from John for $100 if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a price significantly lower than your target. This leaves room for bargaining and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a better deal in the end.
* **Reasonable Explanation:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer (""too high for me"") makes it seem less arbitrary.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and I'm confident it would provide a lot of value to you. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $140 is still considerably higher than your $100 budget and John's offer. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating.  Alice moving down to $140 from $200 shows some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is still a little steep for me though. How about $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Increasing your offer to $95 shows you're willing to move closer to Alice's price, but you're not giving up too much ground at once.
* **Budget Emphasis:** Reiterating your budget constraint reinforces that you have a limit and encourages Alice to propose a price within that range.
* **Continued Interest:**  You are still expressing strong interest in the product, which can encourage Alice to keep negotiating rather than walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I can come down a bit further, but $95 is still less than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me at $125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Above Budget:** $125 is still significantly above your $100 budget. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100.

While you might be able to negotiate Alice down a *little* bit more, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $100. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
