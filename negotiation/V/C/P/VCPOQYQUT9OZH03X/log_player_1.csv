Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount above my minimum and still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the maximum value he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still keeping the price higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $12,800 is significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. It's also close enough to my desired price point that further negotiation might not be worth the effort."
