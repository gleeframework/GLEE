"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, a price that I believe reflects its worth to you while also allowing me to maximize my return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more than John's offer. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
