"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I know it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm thinking of a price around $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.
* There are still 9 rounds left, providing an opportunity to negotiate a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** A $2,000 drop from Alice's offer is significant but not unrealistic.  It shows Bob is serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Sets the Tone:**  This counteroffer establishes that Bob is a savvy buyer and will not be pressured into paying a high price.
* **Leaves Room to Compromise:**  $12,000 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, meaning there's a potential compromise to be made."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I could meet you halfway between our offers at $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has come down from $14,000 to $13,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Deal:**  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and significantly less than John's price of $15,000.
* **Time Factor:** There are only 7 rounds left, and the risk of not getting a deal with Alice increases if Bob continues to reject offers. 

While Bob could try for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer at this point secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
