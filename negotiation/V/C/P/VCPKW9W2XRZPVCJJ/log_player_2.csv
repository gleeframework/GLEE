"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above my budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?  I'm really keen on getting this product, but that's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 12000}
