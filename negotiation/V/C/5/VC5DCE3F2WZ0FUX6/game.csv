"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be firm on your price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
