"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still a little ways off from that price. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $810,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",810000.0,Alice,5,,
