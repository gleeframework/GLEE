Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a substantial gap from my valuation. To keep this moving, I could go up to $700,000.  Do you think we can find common ground there?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains quite wide. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's about as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's clear we have very different valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the minimum amount I'm willing to accept for this product."
