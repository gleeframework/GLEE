"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. My revised offer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $900000. This offers a compromise while still being within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to consider a slight compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary constraints. Based on our previous discussions and the product's value, I would like to propose a final offer of $1000000. This price aligns closely with both our positions and respects the product's worth while fitting within my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one final push to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
