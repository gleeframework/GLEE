"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for a price that reflects the value you see in the product? Would you consider $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offering.**  By rejecting, you initiate a negotiation process where you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To further explore a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we aim for $107? This price reflects the value you see in the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $105. 
* **Continuing the negotiation could lead to a better price.** You have more rounds available, and you've shown a willingness to compromise. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $107 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $106.  This price is close to your last offer and fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to propose $106.50 as the price. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. Please let me know if this price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.** You're aiming to pay $105, and Alice is offering $106.50. This is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation.** While you could try to push for a lower price, it's unlikely you'll get much closer to your ideal price. 
* **Continuing the negotiation is risky.**  You have limited rounds, and if Alice rejects your next offer, you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
