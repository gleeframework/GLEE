"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will be worth every penny for you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. How about $1,500,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of this product and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
