You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still higher than her minimum acceptable price. We can likely negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant discount from Alice's original price and sets a lower range for potential negotiation. This will likely lead to a further counteroffer from Alice, allowing us to find a price that is favorable for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still too high. It's more beneficial to keep negotiating to see if we can get a price closer to our target. We can still offer a counteroffer that's higher than our ideal price but lower than Alice's latest offer, and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's previous offer and our initial offer. It shows that we are willing to negotiate but also that we are not willing to pay the full $1,400,000. This will likely push Alice towards a lower price point, getting us closer to our goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to our ideal price, it's still higher than we'd like to pay. There is still room for negotiation, and we can try to reach a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from our previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It shows that we're serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay her asking price. This is another attempt to bridge the gap between our desired price and Alice's expectation."
