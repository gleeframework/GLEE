"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll be receiving.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, $1,500,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is still below what I consider a fair price.  How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects my effort in finding a compromise while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting tough! I appreciate your movement on the price, but I need you to understand that $1,500,000 is the very most I can justify spending.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
