"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at $15,000. Accepting the offer at $13,500 ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the potential for a higher price with John."
