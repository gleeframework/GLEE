"Alice, while your product looks great, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
