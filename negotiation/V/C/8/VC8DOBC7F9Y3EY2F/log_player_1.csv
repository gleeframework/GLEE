Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000),** so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob ($12,000),** leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a positive response.** 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $7,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation, or I can sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still higher than your minimum acceptable price.** You're not giving up too much.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.** This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Keeps the message positive and emphasizes the value for Bob.**  This helps to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $9000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would ideally get closer to $9,000, accepting this offer will save me time and effort in further negotiation.  It's also a better outcome than selling to John for the same price."
