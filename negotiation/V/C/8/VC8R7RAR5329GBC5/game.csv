"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount considering the product's true value. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go lower.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",995000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be flexible, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still going to need a little more than $995,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a bit more than my initial target, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.",990000.0,Bob,8,
