"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value the product brings to your life.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your life. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,800 is still a touch high for me. Would you consider $10,500?  I'm ready to buy if you can make that work.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you a price of $10,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your life.
