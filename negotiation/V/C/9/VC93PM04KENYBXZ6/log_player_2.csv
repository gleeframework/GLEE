"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product that's worth $10,000 to you for less. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $12,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I'll consider buying it from John instead.
