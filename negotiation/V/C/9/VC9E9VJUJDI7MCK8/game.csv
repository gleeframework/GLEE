"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment, but I'm still looking for a premium for this product. I'll meet you at $650,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
