"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and gives you a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
