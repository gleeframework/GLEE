"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is way above Bob's budget of $10,000. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating. There are still 9 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price from $22,000 to $18,000, it's still too high for Bob's budget. He should reject the offer and continue to negotiate to bring the price closer to his limit.  There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and gives you a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
