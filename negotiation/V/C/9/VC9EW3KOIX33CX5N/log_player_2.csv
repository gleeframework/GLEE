# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial value, it's still above your maximum budget.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. You might be able to get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $1,025,000 is still too high. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. You'll save a considerable amount of money compared to continuing to negotiate with Alice."
