"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for John:** While I want to sell to Bob, I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm staying polite and showing flexibility to encourage further negotiations.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate, as I have 8 rounds left and still have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 7 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is still secure:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:** I'm  lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm keeping my message positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, I'm applying a bit of gentle pressure to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 5 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is still secure:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. This creates some pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small compromise:** I'm only lowering my price slightly, indicating that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm staying positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John's offer:** I'm still confident that I can sell to John if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, Alice, but $8,700 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,400, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of losing out:**  Bob's final offer of $8,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. With only 2 rounds left, I risk losing out on a better price if I keep negotiating.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000.  There's no reason to risk getting a lower price with Bob when I have a much better alternative.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
