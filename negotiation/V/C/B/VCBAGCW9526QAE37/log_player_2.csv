It's always good to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to meet me somewhere in the middle.  It's a bold move, but I'm willing to risk it."

Alice is clearly trying to play hardball. While $920,000 is a better price than $950,000, I'm still hoping to get it down to $850,000. I'm going to counteroffer again."

I'm moving up slightly from my previous offer. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a good price.  It's a compromise, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."

Alice is clearly not going to budge much lower.  While I'd like to get it even lower, $910,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000.  I'm going to take the deal."
