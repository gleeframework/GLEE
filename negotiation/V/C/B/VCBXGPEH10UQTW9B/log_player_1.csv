Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a great product, but I have some budget constraints to consider. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not budging much and we are getting further away from his initial valuation. It's unlikely he will reach $12,000 so it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John."
