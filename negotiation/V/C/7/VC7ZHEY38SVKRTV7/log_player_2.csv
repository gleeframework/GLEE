"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and gives us room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get the price as close to my maximum of $10,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my maximum, I can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when I can secure the product at my limit from John."
