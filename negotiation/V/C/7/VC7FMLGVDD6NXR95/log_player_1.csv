"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. While I'm confident in the product's value, I'm also aware of the $1,000,000 offer from John.  This initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product, and this counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can push for a little more. I have John's offer as a safety net, so there's no rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob is seriously considering buying the product, and this offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident that Bob is serious about buying the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm hoping that I can convince Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to $1,000,000, my minimum acceptable price.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product, and this offer shows my commitment to closing the deal.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer, as it's still significantly higher than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offers steadily decreasing, it's unlikely that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which meets my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. It's time to secure the deal with John."
