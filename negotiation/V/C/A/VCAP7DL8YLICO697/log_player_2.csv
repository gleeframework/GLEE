"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. We believe this price reflects the quality and value it brings to our customers, while still allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. We're confident you'll find the benefits of this product invaluable for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values the product at $80.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think this price is fair considering the value we both see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $95 for the product. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while offering you a competitive deal. I hope you find this proposal more agreeable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
