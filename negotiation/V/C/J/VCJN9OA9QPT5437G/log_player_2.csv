"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $875,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a good compromise considering Alice's initial offer.  It's better than buying from John and getting the product for $800,000, as Alice's offer provides a slightly better deal."
