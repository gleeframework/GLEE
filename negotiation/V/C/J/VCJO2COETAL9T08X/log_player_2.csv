"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $9,500 is still above your ideal price point, and you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value.  This will likely trigger further negotiation, but it's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but staying below Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,600 is a bit high but is now within my budget.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and while I could keep trying, there's a risk of Alice becoming more stubborn or the negotiation going on too long. It's time to close the deal and secure the product before I lose the chance to buy it from John."
