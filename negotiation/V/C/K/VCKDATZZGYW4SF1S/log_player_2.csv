"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest, which is important for successful bargaining.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to my target price and leaves a buffer in case I need to increase my offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, it's still above John's offer. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counter-offer suggests a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and her current offer ($10,500).  This tactic often feels fair to both parties.
* **Staying Firm but Fair:** This offer moves closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below John's offer. 
* **Clear Goal:** My goal remains to buy the product for the best possible price, ideally below $10,000."
