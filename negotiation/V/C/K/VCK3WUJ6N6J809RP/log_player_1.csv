Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low, especially considering he values the product at $15,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 simply doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
