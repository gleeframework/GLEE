"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
