Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can make this work.
