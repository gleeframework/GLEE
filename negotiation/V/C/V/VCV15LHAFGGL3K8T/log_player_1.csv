Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to sell it to John at the lower price."
