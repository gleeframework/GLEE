Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the value of this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this is a great price well below your maximum.  Take the deal!"
