Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? "", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

$950,000 is still too low.  I am confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or with John.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the value of this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
