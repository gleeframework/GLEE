{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $95 is too high. 
* You can potentially get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to get the best possible deal and save as much money as possible. 
* You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so offering $85 is a reasonable starting point.
* This counteroffer is still within your budget, but it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are still trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $90 is better than her previous offer, but still higher than your ideal price.
* There is a chance you can negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You've seen Alice is willing to negotiate, and her last offer was closer to your desired price.
* Offering $87 is a compromise, showing your willingness to meet her halfway but still ensuring a significant saving for you. 
* It leaves room for Alice to counteroffer, but also puts pressure on her to accept, as she's already rejected a similar offer."
