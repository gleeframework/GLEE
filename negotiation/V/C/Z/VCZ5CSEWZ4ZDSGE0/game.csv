"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
