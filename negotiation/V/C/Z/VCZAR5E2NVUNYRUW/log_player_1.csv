Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and engaged in the negotiation, but we're still not at a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before accepting John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to make sure we find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Conveys firmness:**  By stating it's the final offer, I'm signaling a limit to further concessions.
* **Justifies the price:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition.
* **Leaves room for Bob:** While close to my minimum, the slight decrease might be enough to encourage Bob to close the deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, it's highly likely his counteroffer won't meet my needs, and I'll opt to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,010,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $997,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $997,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $997,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's very close, I stated my final offer in the previous round. Accepting a lower price now undermines my negotiating position and sets a bad precedent.  

I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed amount. Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point carries more risk than potential reward."
