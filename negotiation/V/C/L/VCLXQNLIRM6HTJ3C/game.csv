"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of this product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer on the price.  While I see the value, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $700,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
