You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is not budging significantly on her price. The offer of $128 is close to your maximum, but it is still above what you are hoping to pay.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing is too high. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price than to risk being left with nothing."
