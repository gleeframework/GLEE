Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its inherent worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to start too low.  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential"" and ""inherent worth"" to justify the high price without revealing our bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further"" signals to Bob that we're open to negotiation, which might be crucial in securing a deal.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to achieve a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while acknowledging that he might counter-offer. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we have the security of selling to John at our desired minimum price."
