Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she's still quite a bit above your $80 fallback option with John. It's unlikely she'll go as low as $80, especially since she stated this is her final offer. Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
