"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum threshold, and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $95? That's still a good value for you, and closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet halfway, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $85 is a good price considering the limited rounds left and the risk of ending up with just $80 from John. It's a win for me, and I can move on to other opportunities."
