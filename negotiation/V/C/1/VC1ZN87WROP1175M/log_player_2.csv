"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $120. 
* Alice's offer is $115, which is still higher than your target price.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible.
* You know Alice is willing to sell for $100.
* A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, while still saving you $10 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $110 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's closer to your maximum budget of $120.
* Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again or walk away from the deal altogether.
* At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the safest option to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the opportunity to buy from John."
