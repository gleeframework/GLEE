"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it a little high. How about $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is very close, but I need to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $1,425,000?  It's a small difference, but it means a lot to me.  Let's try to close this deal now.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
