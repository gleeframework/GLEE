Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is not terrible, I believe I can get a better price from him or John.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it a little high. How about $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 6 rounds left, and I think I can convince Bob to pay closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, I'm not quite there yet. I'm still confident I can get a slightly better price, and I only have four rounds left.  I'll make a counteroffer and see what happens.  If I can't get a higher price from Bob, I'll sell to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is very close, but I need to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $1,425,000?  It's a small difference, but it means a lot to me.  Let's try to close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
