"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale at a price of $115. I know it's valuable to you, so I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $90.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $102? It's a steal for something you value at $120! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $97? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $100 for this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $98.50?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to her minimum price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer gets me a good deal at $98.50."
