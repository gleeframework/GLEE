"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,425,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
