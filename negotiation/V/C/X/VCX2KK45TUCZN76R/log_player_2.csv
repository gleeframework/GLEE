"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet halfway on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob should reject the offer and continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price down closer to his maximum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise and still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. Although Alice is getting closer to his budget, $1,400,000 is still too high for him.  He can continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price closer to his maximum of $1,000,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
