"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is trying to convince you the product is worth more than it is to her. You can do better!  You're willing to pay up to $150 and John will sell it to you for that, but it's worth trying to get Alice's price lower."
