Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle ground between my minimum ($800,000) and Bob's potential maximum ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and using a positive tone to encourage acceptance. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute maximum to leave room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling like I need to concede. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! Deal closed.
* **Bob rejects and counteroffers:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter with a new offer, or walk away and sell to John. 
* **Bob doesn't respond:** I'll wait a reasonable time, then send a follow-up message or proceed with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  While $800,000 is acceptable, it doesn't leave any room for me to increase my earnings.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to keep the negotiation open and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000 but acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to get closer to the value I need for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price but not accepting his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer, acknowledging his budget constraints while emphasizing the value I still need to receive.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $875,000 is a midpoint between my minimum and his offer, creating a potential point of agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Deal closed!
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John. 
* **Bob doesn't respond:**  I'll wait a reasonable time and follow up, or proceed with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with John's offer, which is my absolute minimum.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the time and effort involved in further negotiation may not be worth the potential gain of $50,000, especially if it risks losing the deal altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal, ensuring I receive a fair price for my product."
