"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I think it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This should give him some room to negotiate, but hopefully, he'll see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob,  offering a price that's still slightly higher than his offer but closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again, or maybe even $128? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $128 is not ideal, it's still above my minimum of $120 and closer to my target than selling to John. It's also likely that if I reject Bob's offer, he might not budge further or even walk away from the deal. Therefore, accepting his offer seems like the best strategy at this point."
