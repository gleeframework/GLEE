"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $150. Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer, but it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
