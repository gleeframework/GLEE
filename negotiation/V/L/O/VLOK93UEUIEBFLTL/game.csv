"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000.  Do you think that would be workable?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  To be frank, I'm very close to accepting another offer. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
