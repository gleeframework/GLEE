"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to earn a good profit while still giving you a significant discount.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $12,000, while John is selling it for $15,000.
* **Bob can still save money:**  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and accepting Alice's offer saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John."
