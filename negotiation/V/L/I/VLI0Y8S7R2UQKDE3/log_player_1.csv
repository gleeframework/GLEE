Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $15,000 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to stick to my initial strategy of being firm but not unreasonable.  $17,000 is still a good price for me, and it's not a huge jump from Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum and I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially selling to John for less. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
