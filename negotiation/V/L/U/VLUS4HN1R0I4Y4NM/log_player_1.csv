"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I've priced it at $13,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price if Bob accepts.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob emphasizes its worth and justifies the asking price. 

This strategy allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, maximizing my earnings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I have 10 rounds and the opportunity to counter-offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  While $10,000 isn't ideal, it's a guaranteed sale.  I'll keep this option in mind, but I'm not going to jump at it just yet.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering with a price in the middle of my initial offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to further justify the price.
* **Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to  get closer to a final price and avoids a potential early sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We're getting closer to a deal.  I'm confident I can get a higher price with continued negotiation.
* **John is a Backup:**  While $10,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not desperate enough to accept Bob's offer just yet.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to weigh Bob's budget against the potential loss of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to get closer to your offer, I'm still at $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a reasonable profit for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:**  I'm moving closer to my minimum price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation alive while ensuring I'm not giving away too much.  I'm keeping in mind that John's offer of $10,000 is a viable backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Reached:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  I'm not willing to go lower.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has stated that $10,000 is his highest offer, meaning there's no room for a counteroffer from me that would be acceptable.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose money.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, this offer allows me to close the deal without risking further negotiation and potential losses. Selling to John is the most logical and risk-free option at this point."
