"Alice, $1800000 is well above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
