Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than its true worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $950,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob. It highlights the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a higher price allows for room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the true worth of the product may encourage Bob to be more willing to pay more.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I have an alternative offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if I can get closer to my goal.
* **Selling to John:**  While $1,000,000 is my ideal outcome, I'm open to exploring a counteroffer from Bob before committing to selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from what I'd normally ask, and it still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm raising the offer slightly from Bob's last one, aiming for a middle ground. This shows willingness to negotiate, but still keeps my offer above his perceived value.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Remaining Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise, but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Building Momentum:** By raising the price slightly, I'm hoping to create a sense of progress and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Options:**  I'm still aware that selling to John remains an option, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value and my alternative offer. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiation seems to have reached a stalemate. Further negotiation might only result in small increments and would likely take more time. 
* **Selling to John:**  Given that John is willing to pay $1,000,000,  selling to him guarantees my minimum desired outcome.  

**Strategy:**

* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a significantly better offer, and it risks delaying the sale. 
* **Secure Outcome:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed, profitable outcome.
* **No Regret:**  While I would have liked to get closer to $1,000,000, selling to John ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
