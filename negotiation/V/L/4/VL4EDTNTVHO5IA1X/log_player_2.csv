"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than its true worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a strong bargaining position because you have a viable alternative in John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from what I'd normally ask, and it still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than your budget, but it is getting closer. You have a good chance of negotiating a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your goal of saving the most money possible."

I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value and my alternative offer. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
