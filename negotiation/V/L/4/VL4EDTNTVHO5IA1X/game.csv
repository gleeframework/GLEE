"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than its true worth.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I have an alternative offer. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from what I'd normally ask, and it still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value and my alternative offer. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
