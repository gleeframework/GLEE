"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
