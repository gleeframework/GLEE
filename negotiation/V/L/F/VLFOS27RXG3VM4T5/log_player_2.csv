"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a good deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're interested, how about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  Let's try nudging the price down a bit more before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're getting closer.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
