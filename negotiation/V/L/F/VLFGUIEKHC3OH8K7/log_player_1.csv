Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's a good starting point:**  It's below Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is short and to the point, focusing on the price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  It's implied that you're open to negotiation, which could lead to a better deal for both of you. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. This provides you with a safety net and leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can get a better deal than $850,000, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price.
* **Opportunity to test the waters:** My counteroffer will give me a better sense of Bob's true price limit and how willing he is to compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise that shows I am willing to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value. 
* **Addressing Bob's Concerns:**  The message directly acknowledges Bob's previous offer and highlights the value of the product to him. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  The offer is not a drastic reduction, suggesting I am still confident in the product's worth.
* **Setting the Stage:**  This counteroffer lays the groundwork for further negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

**Note:**  I am still open to selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail. This provides a safety net and ensures I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move for these reasons:

* **Closing the Deal:** This offer is within a reasonable range, allowing me to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Proceeding to another round with counteroffers could risk Bob backing out entirely, leading to a loss of opportunity. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the deal and move on to other ventures.

**Note:**  While I'm not thrilled with this price, it's crucial to weigh the potential benefits of securing a sale against the risks of continued negotiation."
