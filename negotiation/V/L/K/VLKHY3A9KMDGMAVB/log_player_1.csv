"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, $1,750,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This is a strategic opening move to establish a high starting point for the negotiation. It's unlikely he'll accept this in the first round, but it sets the tone and allows for room to compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate higher in the next round. I have 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum.  The goal is to find a compromise point that allows me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll counter-offer again to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still keeping it above my minimum of $1,500,000. This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer and shows my willingness to meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds. I have 5 rounds left, so I need to be strategic about my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I have 4 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll counter-offer again to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000, which is a further compromise but still above my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations (only 3 rounds left), and I want to find a price that is acceptable to Bob while still allowing me to get a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for him to accept.  If not, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high.  I'm confident I can get a better price with John, and it's worth securing the sale now.  I'm not willing to risk losing a sale to John and only getting $1,325,000 from Bob."
