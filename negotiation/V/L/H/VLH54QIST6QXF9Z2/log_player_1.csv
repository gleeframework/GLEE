Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $11,500.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
