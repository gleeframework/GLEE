"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and while $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher to meet your needs, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
