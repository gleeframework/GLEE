Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly very interested, but we are still a good margin above his initial offer. We'll keep applying pressure while we have negotiating room."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $915,000 offer.  It's time to cut our losses. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is a significant improvement over Bob's best offer.  The potential gains from further haggling with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away."
