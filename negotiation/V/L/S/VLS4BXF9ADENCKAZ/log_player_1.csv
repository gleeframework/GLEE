"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire something truly unique. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and am confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us, there's potential for Bob to value it even more due to its uniqueness. This starting price leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's significance.
* **Confident and Positive Language:**  The message uses language that emphasizes value, exclusivity, and potential. This helps frame the negotiation positively and suggests the product is worth the high asking price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value for the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. While I want to make a deal with Bob if possible, I'm prepared to negotiate further to reach a more agreeable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my safety net but I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,250,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of what's on offer."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I'm coming down from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility, but I'm still significantly above Bob's offer. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a major loss.
* **Highlight Value Again:** The message reiterates the product's value and potential, reminding Bob of what's at stake and justifying the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By suggesting we ""find a middle ground,"" I'm encouraging a more collaborative approach to the negotiation. This can foster a more positive atmosphere for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. While I aimed higher initially, securing $1,000,000 ensures I don't lose out on the product's value.  There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with Bob, and John's offer provides a solid backup option. Accepting now is the most rational choice."
