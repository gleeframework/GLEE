"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation.  I believe this initial price will gauge Bob's interest and potentially trigger a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal profit margin.  I want to push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had three rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely he'll go higher. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing a sale, I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
