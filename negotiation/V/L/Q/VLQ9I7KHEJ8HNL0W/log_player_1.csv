Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $12,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer you $14,000.  This is my final offer.  Otherwise, I have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could be stubborn and try to squeeze out a bit more, Bob's final offer of $14,000 is reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a deal now for a good price than risk losing the sale altogether. John's offer is a safety net, but getting $14,000 now is preferable to dragging this out further."
