"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $12,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we settle at $13,500? It's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this done. How about $15,500? This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you're getting.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer you $14,000.  This is my final offer.  Otherwise, I have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
