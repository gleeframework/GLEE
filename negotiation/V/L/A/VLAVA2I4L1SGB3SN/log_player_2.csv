Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to make one last concession to make this work.  How about $85, and we close the deal now? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her last offer is still above your maximum budget of $80. You have the option to purchase the product from John at your target price, so it makes the most financial sense to do so."
