# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can strike a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I would like to reject the offer. The product is too expensive for me. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
