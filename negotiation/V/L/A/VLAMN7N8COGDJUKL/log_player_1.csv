``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I know he values the product at $800,000, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate up to a certain point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer price. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
