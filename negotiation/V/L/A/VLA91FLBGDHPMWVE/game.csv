"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $105, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is still a great deal for you. It's the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that works for you.",108.0,Alice,5,
