"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price of $550,000 would be more reflective of a fair deal. This takes into account market value and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $550,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $625,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $625,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand the value of the product, but to be realistic, I can't go higher than $650,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and market demand.",675000.0,Alice,7,
