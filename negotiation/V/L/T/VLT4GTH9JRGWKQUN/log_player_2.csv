Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $550,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Alice has now stated this is her final offer twice, and she's unlikely to move much further from this point.  While it's slightly above your ideal price, it's a significant savings over John's offer. It's time to secure a good deal."
