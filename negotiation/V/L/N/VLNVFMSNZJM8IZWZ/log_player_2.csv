# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  reflecting the value of this product and allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **You have more negotiating power.**  You've successfully lowered the price, and you have 7 more rounds to work with. 
* **Buying from John is still a good fallback option.** If the negotiation falls apart, you can buy from John for $800,000.
