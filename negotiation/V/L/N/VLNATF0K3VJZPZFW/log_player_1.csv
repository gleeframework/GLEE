"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
My reasoning: 

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating.
* **Room for compromise:** The price is not my absolute minimum, leaving space for potential counteroffers and a final deal that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth at least $120 to me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's offer of $105 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage to try and secure a higher price.  

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum.  This will allow me to see if there's any room for further negotiation before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves some room for you to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining value:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is still worth at least $120 to me.
* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $108 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not desperate.
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's still a small window to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, as Bob has indicated a willingness to compromise. 

I'm going to counter with a price just slightly higher than Bob's offer.  This will allow me to see if he's willing to go up a little more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $108 is definitely getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a deal:**  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but still have a bit of room to negotiate.
* **Final offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous offer to show flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to make a deal. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $107 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited negotiation room:** There's very little room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Guarantee a good price:**  Selling to John at $120 guarantees a price that meets my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could result in a lower price. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk further negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower price."
