"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
