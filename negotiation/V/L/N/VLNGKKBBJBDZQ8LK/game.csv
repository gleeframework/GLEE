"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this deal done, so I'm going to offer $900000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $950000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm very serious about this deal, and I'm hoping to reach a final number. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to offer $925000 for the product. I truly believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $925000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering a counteroffer of $975000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
