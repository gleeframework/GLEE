# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm very serious about this deal, and I'm hoping to reach a final number.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $925000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering a counteroffer of $975000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate further. It's more prudent to buy the product from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000 to avoid the risk of the deal falling through with Alice."
