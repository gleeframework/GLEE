Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to propose an offer of $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $7,500 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's still a great price for the product and gives you a decent discount.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose an offer of $8000 for the product. This aligns closely with the price offered by another seller and allows us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what John is offering. There's no point in risking further negotiation, especially since we're already in round 4."
