"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $130? Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
