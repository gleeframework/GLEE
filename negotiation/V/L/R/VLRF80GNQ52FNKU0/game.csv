"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell your product and me to acquire it within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
