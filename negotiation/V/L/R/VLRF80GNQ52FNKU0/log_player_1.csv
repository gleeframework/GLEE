Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell your product and me to acquire it within my budget.
