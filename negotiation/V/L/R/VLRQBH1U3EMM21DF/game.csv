"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only pay $9,000 for it. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I've done some research and found that the market value for this product is closer to $9,500. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",9500.0,Bob,4,
