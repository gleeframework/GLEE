"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.  I'm confident this product will be a good investment for me at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,075,000.
