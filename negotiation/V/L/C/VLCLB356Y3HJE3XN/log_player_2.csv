"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and buying from John is still a viable option. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're still in a good position to negotiate further. Buying from John is still an option if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our interests, and I believe we can reach a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking of a price of $1,200,000, which is still below my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential returns it could bring. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is stuck at $1,200,000. You've already counter-offered lower, and she's not budging. It's time to try and lower the price further.  Buying from John is still a possibility, but negotiating with Alice might yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $1,200,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits of the product, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, her offer is still higher than you're comfortable with. You're getting closer to a deal, but there's still room for negotiation. You have 3 rounds left, and buying from John remains a viable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of a price of $1,225,000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round.  Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still too high for your budget.  While you could try to counter-offer one more time, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,500,000 than risk losing the deal altogether. You've successfully negotiated a lower price with Alice but have reached a point where buying from John is the more secure option."
