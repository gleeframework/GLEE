Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum price point, I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This represents a significant adjustment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price.  However, $1,900,000 remains out of reach for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, recognizing the value of the product, but this is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between our needs and is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the product at a significantly higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 as a final offer. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,700,000 is getting closer, it's still slightly beyond my budget.  To show my commitment to closing this deal with you, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, but we're still running out of rounds. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** $1,200,000 is a decent profit, but significantly less than John's offer.
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** We risk Bob walking away, but could potentially get closer to $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John:**  Guarantees the maximum profit, but cuts off negotiations with Bob.

Since we're getting close to John's offer, the risk of continuing with Bob is outweighing the potential reward. 

```json

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While it would have been interesting to see how much further Bob would go, guaranteeing the full $1,500,000 from John is the safest and most profitable decision at this point."
