"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget.  It's far too high, and there's no reason to accept it. You'll need to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum price point, I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This represents a significant adjustment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still above your budget. While she has lowered the price, you can still push for a more favorable deal.  The $800,000 offer from John is a safety net, so you can continue to negotiate with Alice knowing you have a backup."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price.  However, $1,900,000 remains out of reach for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, recognizing the value of the product, but this is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between our needs and is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the product at a significantly higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 as a final offer. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you.
