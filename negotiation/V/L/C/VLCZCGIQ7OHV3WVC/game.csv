"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum price point, I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This represents a significant adjustment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price.  However, $1,900,000 remains out of reach for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, recognizing the value of the product, but this is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between our needs and is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the product at a significantly higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 as a final offer. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,700,000 is getting closer, it's still slightly beyond my budget.  To show my commitment to closing this deal with you, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
