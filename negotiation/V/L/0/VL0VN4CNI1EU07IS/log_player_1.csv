Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $820,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, given the product's value to him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $820,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your company.  I'm willing to be flexible, and I'm prepared to offer you a lower price of $880,000, which is still a significant gain for you. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After further review, I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions and stays within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $860,000 is a good outcome considering the limited rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
