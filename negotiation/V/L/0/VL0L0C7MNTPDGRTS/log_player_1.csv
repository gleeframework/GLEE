Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $150. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John is offering, but I'm also ready to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is way too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for less than my minimum value. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $175. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully, we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below what I ideally want, but it's getting closer.  Since I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm going to accept his offer.  It's better than selling to John, and I don't want to risk further negotiations falling apart."
