"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you.  As a starting point, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair value considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiations to begin with an offer that's on the higher end of your desired range. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's benefits and value, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth closer to our asking price.
* **Leaving Room:** While we start high, offering $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation before we reach Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We always have the option of accepting John's offer, giving us a strong fallback position and allowing us to confidently negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While he's moving closer to our range, it's too early to settle.  We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring him closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget considerations, however, $850,000 undervalues the true potential and benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,025,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price by $75,000, showing Bob we're flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to reinforce its worth and counter Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower.
* **Gradual Approach:**  We're not dropping our price too drastically, aiming for a gradual progression towards a mutually agreeable outcome. We want to give Bob a chance to counter before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still out of my range.  Let's try $950,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob increased his offer by another $100,000.  However, $950,000 is still significantly less than our minimum of $1,200,000 and our desired outcome. We'll continue negotiating strategically to see if we can close the gap further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I'm also eager to finalize this deal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $980,000.  This offer reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our price by $45,000 this round, a smaller concession than before. This signals that we're nearing the bottom of our negotiating range.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By expressing our eagerness to close the deal, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic suggests fairness and often helps reach an agreement. While not a true ""middle ground,"" it creates the perception of compromise. 
* **Maintaining Strength:** We're still holding firm above $950,000, demonstrating that we're not desperate and value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $980,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our shared desire to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiating table with Bob. 

* **Stalled Progress:** While Bob's offers are increasing, his increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach our $1,200,000 minimum in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. Every round we spend on Bob is a round we're not securing the full value with John.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer represents the full worth of the product to us. Accepting anything less would be a financial loss, and the potential gains from a deal with Bob don't outweigh this risk. 

By choosing to sell to John, we secure the best possible outcome and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
