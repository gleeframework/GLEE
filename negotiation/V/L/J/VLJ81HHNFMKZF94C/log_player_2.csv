"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $1,150,000 is a decent offer, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, saving you even more money."
