Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal but also maximizes your profit.  Offering it at your minimum ($1,000,000) would secure the sale but leave a lot of money on the table. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** $1,150,000  This price gives Bob a $50,000 discount, making it an attractive offer. It also nets you an extra $150,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Message:**
    * **Enthusiasm:**  Show you're excited about the product and Bob's potential ownership.
    * **Value Emphasis:** Highlight the ""significant benefits"" without being overly specific (keeps the focus on the overall value).
    * **Fairness:**  Framing the price as ""fair"" suggests a reasonable deal for both parties. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob could counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust slightly, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable, you might consider a slightly lower price to secure it."
