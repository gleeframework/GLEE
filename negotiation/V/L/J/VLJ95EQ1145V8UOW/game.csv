"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the initial price point, I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I believe that $1000000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. It's getting late in our negotiation, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement. I'm confident that we can close this deal if we both focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm not willing to budge too much further. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
