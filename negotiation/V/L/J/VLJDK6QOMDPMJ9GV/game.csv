"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While your offer is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1100000? That would still give you a significant advantage over your current situation, and it's closer to my desired price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for me as well.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
