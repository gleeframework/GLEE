You can do better than $1,150,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While your offer is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1100000? That would still give you a significant advantage over your current situation, and it's closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

You're still in a good position to negotiate a lower price.  While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, you can likely still get it lower by continuing to counteroffer."
