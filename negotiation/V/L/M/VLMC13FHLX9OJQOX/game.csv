"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for around $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet somewhere around $115? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $120?  That's my final offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to go as low as $125, but that's as low as I can go.",125.0,Alice,7,
