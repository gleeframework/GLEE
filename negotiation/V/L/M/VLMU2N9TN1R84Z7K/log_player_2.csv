Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, my budget is a bit tighter than $150.  Would you be willing to come down to $120?  I'm really interested in the product and think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120.  While it's closer, I can still try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm eager to get this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your eagerness to purchase the product, Bob. Considering your feedback, how about we settle on $132? This price reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we've already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely she'll come down further.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John for my target price of $120 and avoid further negotiations."
