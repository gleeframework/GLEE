"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you time to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** While it's an option, you should try to get a better price from Alice first. 

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your preferred price.** While it's lower than her initial offer, you're still aiming for a price closer to $850,000.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.** You still have 7 rounds left, giving you more leverage to push for a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still a viable alternative.**  However, you're still trying to secure the product at a lower price.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and try to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would allow both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still trying to understand your budget constraints. While $875,000 is a step closer, I'm only willing to go down to $890,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit margin and me a fair return. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.**  She's now offering $890,000, which is only $40,000 higher than your last counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **You have a limited number of rounds left.** You have 5 rounds remaining, and it's getting late in the negotiation.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's more expensive.** While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $110,000.

Given the proximity of Alice's offer to your preferred price and the limited time remaining, it makes sense to accept her offer and secure the product at a reasonable cost."
