"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the value it brings while still being a fair deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm seeing your interest, but $13,500 still falls short of what I had in mind. To make this work, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could do $14,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",14000.0,Bob,6,
