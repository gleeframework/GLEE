"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price - a ""discount"" from its ""true value"" - to make it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with an invitation for Bob to respond, showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to get from the sale.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for further negotiation. I can try to get a better price in the next round.
* **John is always an option:** It's important to remember that I can always choose to sell to John and get my desired price. However, I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm again highlighting the ""concession"" I'm making to make the offer more appealing.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to finalize the deal and move forward. This adds a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the concessions I've made so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is the safer option:**  While I want to get the best possible price, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $1,500,000 becomes the more sensible option.
* **Further negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going, but I'm also assessing how much further I'm willing to go down in price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. Time is of the essence here."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This emphasizes that I'm nearing the end of my willingness to negotiate. It adds pressure on Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm once again splitting the difference between our previous offers, demonstrating a continued commitment to reaching a compromise.
* **Alternative options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have alternative options, making him understand that his negotiation window is closing. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""time is of the essence"" further emphasizes the need for a decision, making Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, and I think that's the best we can do. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No further room for compromise:** Bob is adamant about his offer of $1,075,000, and it's clear that he's not going to budge.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a significant profit and meets my minimum requirement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him ultimately rejecting my offers, leaving me with no sale and wasted time.  Selling to John is the safer, more profitable option."
