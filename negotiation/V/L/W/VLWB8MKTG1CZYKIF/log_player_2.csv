{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the unique nature of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, even though it's lower than the initial offer.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and is closer to the value I've assessed for this product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually acceptable deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the product's true potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better price, especially since Alice has indicated this is her ""final"" offer, which might make her more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is closer to my limit.  This deal would be beneficial to both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product and you to gain a sale that's within a reasonable range.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
