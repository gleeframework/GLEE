,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the unique nature of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and is closer to the value I've assessed for this product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually acceptable deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the product's true potential.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is closer to my limit.  This deal would be beneficial to both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product and you to gain a sale that's within a reasonable range.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
