"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product for $950,000.  It's worth significantly more to you than that, and I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly below your maximum budget. 
* You know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
* There's a chance Alice might lower her price further if you reject her initial offer, as she has another buyer but still wants to make a deal.  

By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get the product for a price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."
