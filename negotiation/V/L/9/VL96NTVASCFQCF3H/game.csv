"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to you and my budget.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
