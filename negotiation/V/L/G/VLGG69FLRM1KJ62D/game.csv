Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying it, but I'd be willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $175.  I'd be happy to pay $140 for the product. That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $160? I think that's a fair price for the quality of the product",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $160 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $150.  That's my final offer.",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $150. I'm going to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $155? I think that's a fair price for the product",155.0,Alice,7,
