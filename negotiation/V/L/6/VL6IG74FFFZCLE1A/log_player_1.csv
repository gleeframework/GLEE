# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation. It's best to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed $12,000."
