"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for sending me your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still negotiate further. It's still a better deal to continue with Alice than to buy from John at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $7,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $7,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While we might be able to get it a little lower, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting at $7,200 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
