"Alice, your product seems great, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I believe this product has immense value, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. How about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
