"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  While it's closer, I'm still not quite there.  My absolute max is $12,000.  If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider.  If not, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,6,
