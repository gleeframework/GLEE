You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if there's any room for negotiation before committing.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Considering the product's uniqueness, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are also firm about your budget. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower price, focusing on the product's uniqueness and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** $1,000,000 still leaves room for Alice to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open and potentially finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, making her offer more attractive.
* **Good Value:** $1,100,000 is still a good price, saving you $100,000 compared to your initial budget.
* **No Guarantee of Lower:** There's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price if you continue negotiating. You might end up paying more if Alice gets stubborn or you run the risk of her pulling the deal entirely. 

It's a good opportunity to secure the product at a price that's both favorable and within your budget."
