"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You'll pay $950,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,000,000 you'd pay from John. 
* **Your goal is to save money:** The prompt explicitly states your goal is to save money while still buying the product."
