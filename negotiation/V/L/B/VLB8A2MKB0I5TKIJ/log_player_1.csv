Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit.  I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob to encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is more than Bob values the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for some negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the benefits for Bob of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $130? It would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent deal considering his initial offer of $125. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
