"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $105 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $108 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $106.  Let's close this deal!",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go down to $106 just yet. How about we try $109? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
