"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $120 from John, so there's room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $105 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're still closer to your target price of $100, and it's worth trying to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $108 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $106.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go down to $106 just yet. How about we try $109? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's probably a good idea to accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for $109, which is significantly cheaper than John's price of $120. While you're still a bit higher than your target of $100, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk having to buy from John."
