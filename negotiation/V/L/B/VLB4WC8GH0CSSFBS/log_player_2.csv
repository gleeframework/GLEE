"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. While $1,200,000 from John is a good deal, there's potential to get a lower price from Alice.  We have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are aiming to get as close to our $1,200,000 target as possible.  This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. We're aiming to demonstrate our commitment to buying the product while also showcasing that we're serious about securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price, but we can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows us to potentially close the gap further.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if we can get closer to our target price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by coming down to $1,350,000.  We're aiming for a price closer to our limit, and a counteroffer of $1,300,000 shows we are serious about closing the deal but are still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to move closer to our target price, but we're still within striking distance of our ideal price. We've demonstrated our commitment to getting a good deal, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going. It's possible that a small counteroffer could push Alice to accept our final price. While buying from John is always a safe bet, it's worth seeing if we can close the gap just a bit more with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,280,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been slowly coming down in price, and we're now within $40,000 of our target. This counteroffer demonstrates our desire to close the deal while still pushing for a more favorable price.  If Alice rejects this offer, buying from John is still a viable option, but we've shown our willingness to negotiate and might be able to secure a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved back up in price, but we're still within a range where further negotiation could get us closer to our goal. We've shown a willingness to compromise, and rejecting this offer allows us to potentially close the deal at a more favorable price.  While buying from John is always an option, we've demonstrated our commitment to finding the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,290,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice seems to be matching our efforts. This counteroffer represents a slight increase from our previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.  We're getting closer to our target price, and this move could potentially entice Alice to accept and close the deal.  If rejected, buying from John is still a viable option, but we're aiming for a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the 9th round, and we're very close to our target price.  While we could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject it and force us to buy from John. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,295,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit more than our ideal price, but it's still a good deal and a successful negotiation.  It's also worth considering that if we reject this offer and buy from John, we'll have to pay the same amount, but without the satisfaction of a successful negotiation."
