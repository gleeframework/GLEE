I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows I'm serious about buying the product but also unwilling to pay her asking price."

While Alice is getting closer to my value, $150 is still too high. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $120. This is my maximum value for the product, and I'm hoping Alice will accept. If she doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly not willing to budge on her price. I've already made my final counteroffer and it was rejected. I'm not willing to pay more than $120, so it's time to move on. I'll buy the product from John."
