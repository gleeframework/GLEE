Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed $15,000.
* **Perceived Value:**  The message highlights the product's value, potentially making the higher price more palatable. 

It's a balance between ambition and realism. While aiming high, the offer shouldn't be so exorbitant that it completely discourages Bob from considering it."
