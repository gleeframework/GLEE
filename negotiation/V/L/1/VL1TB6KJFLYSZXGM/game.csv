"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives you a good deal on a product worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $115 is still too low. How about we go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and you'll get a great value. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
