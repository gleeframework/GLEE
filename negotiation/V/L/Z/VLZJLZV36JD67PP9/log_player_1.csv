Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $300,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're positioning the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High Anchor:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence implies the product is worth the price.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,400,000 â€“ a great deal!
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm to a price above $1,250,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,200,000. You didn't lose anything in this scenario.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Negotiation is an art, and factors like your relationship with Bob and your negotiation style could influence your strategy."
