"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product description] for a price that is sure to be mutually beneficial.  I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.  Let's discuss a price that reflects its value to you, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell above her valuation of $1,200,000. 
* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 but want the best deal.
* **John's Price:** John acts as a price ceiling. You know you won't pay more than $1,500,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her minimum. If not, you can always buy from John at your maximum price."
