Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value for Bob:** This price is still attractive to Bob as he values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and gives us a chance to find a price that is mutually beneficial.
* **John as a Backup:** The fact that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This means I can be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd prefer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's $1,000,000 offer is a fallback, I'm not desperate to sell right now.
* **Potential for a Better Price:**  By rejecting and counteroffering, I can try to get closer to my ideal price of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially get us closer to an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet in the middle and see if he's more likely to accept a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firm on his offer of $1,100,000, and I've already counteroffered. Further negotiation might just result in more back and forth. 
* **John's Offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, this would mean losing $100,000.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,100,000 is still a good price, especially considering my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Delay:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Bob altogether, especially if he's not willing to budge.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a reasonable price and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
