"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what it's worth to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my minimum price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $14,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
