Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,5,
