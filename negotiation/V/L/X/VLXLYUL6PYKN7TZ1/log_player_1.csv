"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this price is more reasonable and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, and I think this price is more reasonable considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Accepting $750,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table. I'm willing to counter-offer again to see if I can get closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To show I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I add a sense of urgency. It also sets a firm boundary for myself. If Bob doesn't accept this, I'm comfortable walking away and accepting John's offer to ensure I get my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product, and I think this price is more reasonable considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet my near-final offer of $850,000. It seems unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in subsequent rounds to make it worth continuing the negotiation. Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay."
