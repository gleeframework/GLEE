I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's higher than his perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above Bob's initial offer. I believe this price is a good compromise and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
