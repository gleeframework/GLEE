* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.**  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my budget.** I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000.
* **This time, I'm choosing to buy from John.**  While I could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a lower price, and I'm running the risk of the negotiation dragging on. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price within my budget, and I'm confident I can get the product at a reasonable price.**"
