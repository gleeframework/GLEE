"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd really get a lot of use out of it. I'm asking for $200 to start, but I'm open to discussing the price further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with it for. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too expensive compared to John's offer of $100. Let's continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but I have a strict budget. Could we do $100? That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 100}"
