Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message hints at the product's worth by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential.""
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, rather than simply accepting or rejecting the initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know the product's value to Bob, we don't know his negotiation style or financial limits. A very aggressive starting price might make him walk away without a counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Having a guaranteed buyer in John provides you with a strong fallback position. This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
