"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident that I can get a better deal through further negotiation, or potentially with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for it. This price is fair considering the worth it holds for you. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
