"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $8,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
