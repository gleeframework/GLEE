"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $650,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",850000.0,Alice,5,
