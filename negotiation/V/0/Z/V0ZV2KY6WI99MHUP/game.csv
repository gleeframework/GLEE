,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit high for you, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high. I can go up to $9800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $9800 is still a bit low for me. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product might be worth it to me, but $11000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $11000, so I'll offer $10400. Can you consider that?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11200. It's still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to make a concession. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to think I should consider other options. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $10900, and I'm starting to think that I'll just have to walk away if we can't meet on a price. Can you seriously consider meeting me at $10900?",10900.0,Bob,10,
