Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product without being pushy. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects the initial offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I will always keep my minimum acceptable price of $150 in mind. If the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfying point, I have the option to sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since John is willing to pay $150.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This will allow me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives me a decent margin while hopefully being within your budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered the price to $125, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to his budget. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his offer, showing flexibility, and reiterating my desire to find a compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that $125 is a fair price considering the product's value to me and Bob's limited budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $95. That would be a good compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since John is willing to pay $150.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's current offer but lower than my previous offer. This will keep the negotiation moving while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered the price to $110, which is halfway between my previous offer ($125) and Bob's latest offer ($95). This shows a genuine attempt to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the fair value of the product. I'm using persuasive language to encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's budget. This could be a sweet spot to finalize the deal. If he rejects this offer, I might consider accepting John's offer for $150, especially if the negotiation starts to drag on."
