"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you have a clear benchmark for a successful negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates a genuine interest in the product while establishing a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You know you can get the product from John for $10,000, so you have leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $15,000, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again shows your willingness to compromise, but it also keeps you below your maximum budget.  It's a small increment from your previous offer, showing that you're taking her counteroffer seriously but still trying to push for a lower price."
