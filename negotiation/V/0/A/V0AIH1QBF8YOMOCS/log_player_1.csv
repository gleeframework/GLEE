While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $850,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still making a substantial profit over the product's minimum value to me ($1,000,000). 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential for Bob to walk away.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and future rounds could lead to smaller increments. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by being overly aggressive."
