"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price.  $10,000 is too low.  I can always sell to John, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to counter again.  It's risky, but I think I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $10,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $11,250?  It's closer to your offer, and it would let me get closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for more, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  $10,750 is still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
