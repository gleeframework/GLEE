"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1250000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $1280000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair reflection of the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can finally close this deal!",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Remember, this product is worth significantly more to you, and this price still represents a great deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
