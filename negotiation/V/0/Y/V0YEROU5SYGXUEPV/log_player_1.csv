{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation.  It's also a price that still gives me a good profit margin, while being potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $105. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I still think I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $100?  It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum price, I don't want to risk going any lower and potentially losing money. John is offering me a much better price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
