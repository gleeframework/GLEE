"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $12,000 John is offering, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and provides a good starting point for further negotiation. It's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product while still aiming for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's closer to his ideal price, there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in future rounds without resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $10,000.  $9,000 represents a compromise and shows Bob is serious about making a deal while still striving for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He has already shown his willingness to negotiate and is likely to get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer. There are still several rounds remaining, and he doesn't want to risk paying a higher price than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility while still keeping the price below $10,000.  This counteroffer is close to the middle ground between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous offer.  He hopes to reach a compromise in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob wants, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Bob has only 3 rounds remaining, so he needs to be careful about accepting a deal that's too high. He's shown persistence in his counteroffers and is likely to be able to secure a better deal with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's willing to meet her halfway. This offer is only $250 away from Alice's last offer, and with only two rounds remaining, Bob is making a serious attempt to close the deal.  He's aiming to secure a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, and this counteroffer is likely to be close to what Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still a risky price for him.  With only one round remaining, he needs to be careful. Rejecting the offer gives Bob one last chance to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better price. If Alice rejects his final counteroffer, Bob can still buy from John, although he would prefer to save the money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer, and he needs to make it count. He's increasing his price to $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's last offer of $11,000.  This shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal, but he's not willing to go much higher.

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to buy from John for $12,000. However, there's a good chance that Alice will accept this offer. She's been gradually reducing her price, and it's likely she's close to her minimum acceptable price. This offer gives her a good profit while also allowing Bob to save a substantial amount of money."
