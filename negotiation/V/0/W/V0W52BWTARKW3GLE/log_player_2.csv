"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm happy to start the bidding at $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $12,000. There's room for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price considering her original asking price and your maximum budget.  Accepting the offer gets you the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
