"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up with a new offer.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $9,400. It's a great price for both of us. What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,5,
