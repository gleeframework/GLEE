Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit. 
* **Create a Sense of Exclusivity:** By offering the product to Bob before a public listing, you imply it's in high demand and encourage him to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, the message implies you're open to discussion, giving Bob a chance to feel involved and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of selling to your guaranteed buyer at $15,000."
