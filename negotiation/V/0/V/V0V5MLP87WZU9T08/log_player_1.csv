Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $90 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing the Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to me (""at least $100"") emphasizes its potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $100 allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **John as a safety net:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit, making it a safer option than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest. There's still room to negotiate a higher price, which I will attempt in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and reinforces my position.
* **Fair Deal Focus:** Framing it as a ""fair deal for both of us"" encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Avoiding John (for now):**  I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob. His offer indicates interest, and this counteroffer could secure a sale at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or a stalemate, potentially leading me to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Time and Effort:**  While $82.50 isn't my ideal price, it's a decent outcome considering the time already spent negotiating.
* **Avoidance of John:** Accepting the offer allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower price and potentially earning more in the process."
