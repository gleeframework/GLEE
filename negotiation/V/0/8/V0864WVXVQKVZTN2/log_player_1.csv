{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but not excessively so. It allows for negotiation, but also shows I value the product. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, it's important to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. Bob's counteroffer is my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with it yet. I'll make a counteroffer to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my absolute minimum of $15,000, and closer to my initial offer than his first counteroffer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking the sale and potentially getting only $15,000 from John. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal for me."
