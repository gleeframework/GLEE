Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000. This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence can make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decrease the price, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle but still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** While there's a chance Bob might accept this high offer, it's more likely he will counter or reject it.  You've built in a safety net with John, allowing you to aim high and potentially secure a significantly higher profit."
