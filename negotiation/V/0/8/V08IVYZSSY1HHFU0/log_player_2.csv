Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards of excellence. This exceptional item is worth more than $1500000 to us, and we believe it could be an invaluable asset to you. Considering its unique features and the benefits it offers, I am proposing a special introductory price of $2000000. We understand that this might be a significant investment, but we are confident that the value it brings will far exceed the cost. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000 for the product. I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and $2,000,000 is way above my budget of $800,000.
