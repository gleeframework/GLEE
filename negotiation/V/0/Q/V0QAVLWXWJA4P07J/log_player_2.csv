"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a lower price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I could meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your investment considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or that further negotiations could drag on. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and a substantial saving compared to John's offer."
