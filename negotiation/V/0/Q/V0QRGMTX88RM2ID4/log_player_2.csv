"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time deal. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get it closer to $12,500, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can meet you halfway, though! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target range. Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? "", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not quite ready to meet your target of $13,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than $13,250 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product at $13,750.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $15,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $1,250 compared to buying from John. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good compromise and a significant saving. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but the risk is that Alice may reject the counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
