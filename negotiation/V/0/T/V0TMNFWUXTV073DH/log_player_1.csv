"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to me, aiming to maximize my profit. However, I'm still within a range that I believe is reasonable for Bob, considering he values the product at $12,000. I'm also establishing a friendly tone to encourage a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'd like to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering and very close to what I'm aiming for. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
