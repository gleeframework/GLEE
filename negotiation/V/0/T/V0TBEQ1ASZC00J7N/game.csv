"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
