"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that my initial offer is high enough to potentially close the deal in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the ""significant compromise"" I'm making to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm ending the message with a positive and open statement, inviting further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than his initial offer. It's important to close the deal now before he changes his mind or the negotiation drags on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or me running out of rounds. Accepting his offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal.
* **Time is Money:**  With limited rounds, it's crucial to make strategic decisions.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this stage."
