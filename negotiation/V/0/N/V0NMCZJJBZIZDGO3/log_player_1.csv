Round 8
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has clearly stated his final offer. Continuing to negotiate might push him away, risking the entire deal. Accepting the $860,000 is a significant profit and a safer bet than hoping for a better outcome in the next two rounds."
