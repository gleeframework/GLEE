"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $850,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significant, and I believe closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $870,000. How about we meet somewhere in between?",870000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $850,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $860,000. How about we try again?",860000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer.",860000.0,Bob,8,
