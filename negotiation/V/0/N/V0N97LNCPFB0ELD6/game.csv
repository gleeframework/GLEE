I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm comfortable offering $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects a mutually beneficial price point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1025000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1025000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1000000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value and my costs.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $987500. This is a very fair compromise, given the value I'm placing on the product and your need to make a profit.  I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",987500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're very close, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $995000? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my costs.",995000.0,Alice,9,
