{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the value of the product for Bob to create a sense of urgency and motivate him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. I'm prepared to walk away if needed and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or potentially John. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my commitment to a fair price and signal my willingness to continue negotiating. This may encourage Bob to raise his offer closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from it, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial counter. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own interests.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging further negotiation while emphasizing the value Bob will gain.
* **Open to finding a solution:**  I'm signaling that I'm flexible and open to finding a compromise that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000. Can you throw in some more extras or consider a price reduction to $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John as backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm going to continue to push for a higher price. Bob's persistence shows he's interested, and I believe I can still get him to come closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** 

I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still well above Bob's current offer. I'll try to find a compromise that both parties can agree on while staying above my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still confident that this product is a valuable investment for you. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and finality:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also setting a firm line.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product, hoping to further motivate him to accept.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both parties, hoping to create a sense of cooperation.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a sale above my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll proceed with selling to John for $1,200,000 as he's my guaranteed buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to pay $1000000. I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $985000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer of $985,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately receiving a lower price than I could get from John.

**Conclusion:**

The potential benefits of continuing to negotiate with Bob don't outweigh the certainty of a higher sale price with John. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
