Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000. This is because I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) willing to pay that amount.
* **Bob's perceived value:** $8,000. This means Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000, but no more.
* **Negotiation space:** I need to find a price that is higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 

By offering $14,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (he's saving $1,000) while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.  

While there's no guarantee Bob will accept, this offer maximizes my chances of getting a better price than my fallback option with John."
