"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so take advantage of it while you can! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is pretty close to your maximum, but there's room for negotiation. You're better off seeing if you can get a lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I like the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and expresses interest while clearly stating your desired price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $70, you're signaling that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you're looking for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $82 is still closer to her desired price than yours. There's room for more negotiation.  You're aiming for $70, and there's no rush to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  You're moving up from your initial offer of $70, signaling willingness to compromise but not capitulating entirely.
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:** $75 represents a price point closer to the middle of your initial offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and reinforces your interest in a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go a bit lower and sell the product to you for $79. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down to $79, which is only $9 above your target price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, and you risk ending up with John's $100 offer.  
* **Saving is Good:**  Getting the product for $79 is a decent deal, even if it's not the absolute lowest you might have gotten."
