"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but  I could only consider a price closer to $60. Would that work for you?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $145 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $80? I believe that's a fair offer."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $80 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $115 for a quick sale.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly higher than John's price of $80.  There's little incentive to continue negotiating with Alice when you have a guaranteed option at your target price."
