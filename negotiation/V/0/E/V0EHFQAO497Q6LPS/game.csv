"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference between our last offers - I'm willing to accept $887,500. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $875,000 again. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",875000.0,Bob,6,
