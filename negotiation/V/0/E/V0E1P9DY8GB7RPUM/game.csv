"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a win-win for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a better deal. Let's try $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $11,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet at $10,800?",10800.0,Alice,5,
