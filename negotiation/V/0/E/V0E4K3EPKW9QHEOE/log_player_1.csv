Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup (20% over my minimum) is a reasonable starting point. It might be enough to entice Bob without being so high that he automatically rejects the offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer seem more attractive. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, I might be willing to lower the price closer to $100 to secure the sale. However, starting higher gives me more room to negotiate."
