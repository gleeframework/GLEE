Round 5
Alice's offer:

I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This price is closer to the product's value to me, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the benefits you'll get from owning it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,175,000.
