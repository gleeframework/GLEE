"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and its worth to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
