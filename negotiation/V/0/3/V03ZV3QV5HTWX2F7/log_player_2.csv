"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum, it's still above your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further to reach a price closer to $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to consider one more concession. How about we meet at $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's latest offer is still above your budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving you $1,200. Continuing the negotiation with Alice might result in a slightly better price, but it's not worth the risk of not getting the product at all or further increasing the price."
