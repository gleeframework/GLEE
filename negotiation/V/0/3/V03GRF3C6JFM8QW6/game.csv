"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $10,500, and I think that's a fair price given the value we both see in the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,
