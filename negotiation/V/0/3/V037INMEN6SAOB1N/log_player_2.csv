# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting her offer saves you the most money."
