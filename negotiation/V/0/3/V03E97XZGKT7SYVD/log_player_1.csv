Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. My initial offer is $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1100000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and $1,000,000 to John. Given that Bob is willing to pay $1,100,000, it makes sense to hold out for a better offer, as there is potential to get closer to the value Bob perceives.  It is still early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,175,000? This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1175000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to the price I want.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd have to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a better price than John, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation."
