Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true value and the numerous benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has a high value, but I still think $1,500,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, I'm still leaving a lot of money on the table compared to my minimum acceptable price. Bob stating it's his ""final offer"" could be a negotiation tactic. I'll push a bit further, but need to carefully consider my next move as to not alienate him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my initial price.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground to show a willingness to compromise.  
* **Finality:**  I'm not explicitly stating it's my ""final offer,"" but the tone suggests I'm getting close to my limit.  
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to reinforce why the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. Bob seems anchored at $1,800,000.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns. Dragging it out delays receiving the funds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a risk Bob walks away. Accepting $1,800,000 is a substantial gain compared to John's offer."
