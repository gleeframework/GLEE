"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true value and the numerous benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has a high value, but I still think $1,500,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my initial price.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
