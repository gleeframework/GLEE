"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product, I believe $150 is a fair price. However, if you're unable to meet at that price, I would like to explore other options. Could you consider $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Reason: While closer to my ideal price would be great, getting $160 from Bob is better than settling for $150 from John. It's a reasonable compromise."
