Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price would still allow you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
