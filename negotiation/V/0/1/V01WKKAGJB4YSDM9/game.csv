"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $90 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $105. That's a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to get a good price for this product. How about $108? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",108.0,Alice,5,
