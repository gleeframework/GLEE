"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $875,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best we can do. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we try $885,000?",885000.0,Alice,5,
