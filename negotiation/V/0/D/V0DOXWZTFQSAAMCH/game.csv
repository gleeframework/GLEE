"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me think about it... I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
