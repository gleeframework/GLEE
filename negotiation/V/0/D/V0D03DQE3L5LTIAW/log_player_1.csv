Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm prepared to let it go for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong buyer lined up."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $12,000 gives you a buffer.
* **Create Urgency:** Letting Bob know you have another buyer creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he doesn't act quickly. 
* **Justify the Price:**  By mentioning the product's worth and your ""other buyer,"" you provide a reason for the higher price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a seemingly fair deal."
