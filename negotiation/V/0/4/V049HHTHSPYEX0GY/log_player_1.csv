Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and offers a small but enticing discount from your guaranteed sale.  
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
