"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a reason for the price and highlighting the value Bob might perceive.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves space for Bob to counter and still allow me to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time to negotiate:** I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore options with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm reiterating the value Bob places on the product to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  I'm explicitly trying to reach a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining and am in a strong position to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. Can we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiating room:** I have 7 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:** I'm not desperate to close the deal and have a backup option with John at $15,000. 

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  $13,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:** I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to justify my price.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using language like ""let's close this deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Time is a factor:** With 6 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider if I should continue negotiating with him or move on to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my desired price range.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might not come up further, and I might end up selling to John for $15,000, which is less than what Bob is offering now.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting $14,000 is better than potentially ending up with $15,000. It also keeps me above my minimum desired value.

**Next Steps:**  I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
