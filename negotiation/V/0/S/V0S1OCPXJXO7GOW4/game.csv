"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",825000.0,Alice,5,
