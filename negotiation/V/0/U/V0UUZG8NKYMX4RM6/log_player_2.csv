Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1080000 and $1025000, which would be $1052500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,052,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,052,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $1,052,500 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  He has 5 rounds left, but it's getting close to the deadline, and the negotiations are getting tighter. It's a calculated risk, but at this point, Bob is better off taking the guaranteed deal with John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
