Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering this product to you at a price of $1,500,000. It's a steal considering its potential value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Enticing language:** I'm using language that highlights the product's potential value and emphasizes the ""steal"" aspect to create a sense of urgency and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open ended question:** I end the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start a conversation. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the initial offer. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and his counteroffers.
* I'll be prepared to potentially lower my price, but I'll try to negotiate as high as possible.
* If the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'll have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I at least meet my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for a higher value. Bob has shown interest, but his offer is still below my target. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a great value for you. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment at this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's concerns:** I start by acknowledging Bob's budget constraints to show I'm listening and willing to compromise. 
* **Meeting him halfway:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,450,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the significant discount from my initial offer and reiterate the product's value to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Expressing confidence:**  I finish by expressing confidence in the value proposition, encouraging Bob to see the potential of the product at the proposed price.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'm prepared to potentially negotiate further depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Could we perhaps aim for $1400000? This would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stood firm at $1,400,000, and while this is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not comfortable settling at that point.  I've already made a concession, and I'm not sure further negotiation will get me significantly closer to my desired value.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
