"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $14000?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14500 is still a little too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident that $13500 would be a fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise and ensures a win-win situation. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still think $13500 is a bit below the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
