,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $900000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $700000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $700000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $850000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $800000. I'm making a final counteroffer at $800000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",800000.0,Bob,6,
