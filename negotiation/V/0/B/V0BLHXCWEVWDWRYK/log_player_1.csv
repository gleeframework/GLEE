Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your $120 minimum, allowing for some flexibility if Bob counteroffers. 

By offering a fair price and starting the conversation, you increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below your minimum value of $120, and you can easily get a better price from John. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, hopefully pushing the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $90?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below what you'd be willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you could get from John. By rejecting, you can attempt to nudge Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my last offer. How about $85? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
