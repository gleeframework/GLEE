"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your potential benefits.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1550000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that meets your needs and reflects the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're confident in your final offer, but I'm afraid $1650000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $1575000 or lower. I'm willing to pay $1575000 for the product.",1575000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'm proposing $1625000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that meets your needs and reflects the product's worth.",1625000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $1625000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1600000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
