"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discounted price,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a more favorable deal than my initial offer, while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I hope this revised proposal aligns better with your budget and we can move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

I hope this proposal is acceptable to you, and we can finalize the transaction soon.",890000.0,Alice,5,
