{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price,  $90 is within my acceptable range and better than selling to John for $100. I'm confident I can still make a profit with this sale."
