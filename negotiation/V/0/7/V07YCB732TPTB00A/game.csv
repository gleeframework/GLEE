"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming to stay within a stricter budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
