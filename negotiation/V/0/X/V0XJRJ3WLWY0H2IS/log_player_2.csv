Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $145?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

Bob should reject the offer. While $145 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a better price from John."
