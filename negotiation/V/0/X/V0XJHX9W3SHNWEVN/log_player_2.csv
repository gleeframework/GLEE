"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $120 is the maximum he's willing to pay, he's not eager to jump at the first offer.  Rejecting allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a significant discount. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiation and sets the stage for a potential compromise.  A $20 discount is a reasonable starting point while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price. While he's willing to pay $120, he's not going to exceed that limit.  He still has rounds left and can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of staying under $120.  He's willing to meet Alice halfway by increasing his offer slightly.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiation stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  He has already made a counteroffer and been rejected.  It's likely further negotiation will be fruitless, and the risk of a higher price is too great.  Purchasing from John guarantees the product at his maximum price."
