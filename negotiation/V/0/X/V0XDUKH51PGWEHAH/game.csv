,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80 either. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to accept that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is closer to what I can afford and also a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can offer you a slight discount to $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",105.0,Alice,5,
