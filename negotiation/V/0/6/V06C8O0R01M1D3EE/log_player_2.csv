"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject and counteroffer to see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $550,000 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum budget of $800,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
