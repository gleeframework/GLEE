Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high initially. Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly stated to Bob, the knowledge that you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of value and scarcity, potentially making Bob more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This response assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style. If you knew he was, for example, very averse to high prices, a different approach might be better.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The prompt doesn't mention any time pressure.  If there were a deadline, it might influence how aggressively you price the product."
