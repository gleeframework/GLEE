Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for some negotiation room.  I'm confident the product is valuable, and I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me and gives Bob some room to negotiate further if he wants."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept his offer."
