Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're proposing. 

I've also included a friendly message to make the interaction feel more personal. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with. If Bob rejects your offer, you can always adjust your price or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only justify spending up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between Bob's offer of $10,000 and my ideal price of $15,000. By offering $11,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise, while still making a profit. It's a smaller step down from my previous offer, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about getting this deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to go above $10,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I believe I can push for a better deal by making another counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

By offering $11,250, I'm splitting the difference between Bob's last offer of $10,500 and my previous offer of $11,000. This shows a genuine desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this offer will be more appealing to Bob, as it's closer to his last offer while still being significantly better for me than selling to John."
