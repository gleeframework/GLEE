"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your continued interest, $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
