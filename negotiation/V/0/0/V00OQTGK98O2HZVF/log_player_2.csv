{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'll start by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,250,000, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is high. It's time to secure this product at a reasonable price."
