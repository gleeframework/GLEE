While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slower rate than my counteroffers are decreasing.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
