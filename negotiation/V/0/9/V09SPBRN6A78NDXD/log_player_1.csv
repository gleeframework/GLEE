Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both parties, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, allowing Alice to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a significantly larger profit if Bob accepts or negotiates down to a price still above $1,500,000."
