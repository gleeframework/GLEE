Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really keen on the product. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While you have John as a backup, a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Securing a sale with Bob at a good price is preferable to waiting for John."
