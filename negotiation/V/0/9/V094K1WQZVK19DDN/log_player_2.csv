Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down in price. While I could try to push for $100, there's a risk she'll become less flexible. Accepting at $105 ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
