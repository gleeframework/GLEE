"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,500? That would be a good compromise and allows us to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
