"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  There's room to negotiate.  Alice's price is still higher than the product's value to her, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** You have an alternative, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:**  It's a fair price, considering the product's value to Alice ($8,000) and your maximum budget ($10,000). 
* **Opening for Agreement:**  This leaves room for potential compromise if Alice needs to go slightly higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Improved Offer:** Alice has lowered her price significantly from the initial offer. 
* **Good Deal:** $9,000 is a good price for you, considering your maximum budget is $10,000.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  While you might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer allows both you and Alice to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
