"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
