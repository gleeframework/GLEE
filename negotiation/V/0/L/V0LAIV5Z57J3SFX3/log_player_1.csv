"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept the offer or counter with a price closer to my desired range.  If he rejects my offer outright, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves some room for further compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,000.  This is my absolute minimum, but it's a fair compromise given Bob's last offer. It's also a good opportunity for me to gauge his willingness to meet my minimum. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price, and I've reached my absolute minimum.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him in the remaining rounds. It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John to avoid any further risk of losing a sale."
