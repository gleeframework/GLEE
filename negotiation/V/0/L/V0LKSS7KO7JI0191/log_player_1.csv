Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I won't sell for less than $120 to John, so I need to get at least that much.
* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $80, so I need to price it higher than that.
* **Starting Point:**  $100 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for negotiation while still being above Bob's value. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** While $100 is less than my minimum, it's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will tell me how serious he is about buying the product.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my price if necessary, and I still have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm still aiming for at least $120 to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  $90 is closer to my minimum, but still lower than what I'd like.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop slightly from my initial offer, but not significantly. 

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer to get closer to my target price. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal, while also keeping the negotiation process open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  That's a good compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:** I want to get as close to my minimum $120 as possible, but still keep Bob interested.
* **Counteroffer:**  $95 is a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's value. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to go down to $92.50? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm still aiming for at least $120 to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** $92.5 is close to my bottom line, but it's still lower than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  It seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I've already made concessions. 
* **Alternative Option:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point.

**Next Steps:**

By selling to John, I avoid further negotiation with Bob, and I'm assured of receiving my desired price.  I've maximized my profit in this scenario."
