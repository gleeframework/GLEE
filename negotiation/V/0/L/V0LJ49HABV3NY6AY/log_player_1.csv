I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum value.  I'll be prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's reaction and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay. There's no need to continue negotiating, as I can secure the same amount immediately from John."
