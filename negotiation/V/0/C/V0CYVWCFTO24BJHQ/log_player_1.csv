{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I also have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if I'm not satisfied with the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? It's a fair price, and it still gives you a great value for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm reducing my price by $1,500, which is a significant compromise. I believe this price is still within a reasonable range and offers a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a reasonable compromise. It's still above my minimum of $10,000, and it's likely that further negotiations will only lead to more back and forth. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
