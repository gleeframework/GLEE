"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $11,500. Since Alice values the product at $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,900 is lower than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **Alice has shown a willingness to compromise:**  Alice has lowered her price multiple times.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's possible Alice will not budge. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects the offer and tries to negotiate further, Alice might withdraw the offer completely or choose to sell to someone else.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $10,900 is the best course of action, as it secures the product within Bob's budget while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
