"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my desired price.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I'm hoping to get that amount.  However, I'm aware that Bob's value for the product is lower.  We'll see if he's willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my desired value than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still far from what the product is worth to me. I'm not ready to sell at this price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000. This is getting closer to Bob's valuation, and I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him. It's a significant compromise on my end, but I still want to secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,025,000.  This is a small compromise, but I want to keep the deal alive. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's offer of $995,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time.  While I would prefer to secure a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing the entire deal by pushing further. 

I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $1,200,000. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids any potential for further negotiation failures."
