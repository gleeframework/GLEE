Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup ensures you're not desperate and allows you to confidently propose a strong initial price to Bob. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and presenting the price as an ""opportunity"" rather than a demand."
