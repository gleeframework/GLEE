Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price is a good middle ground to begin the negotiation. 

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** You're aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, which is the most profitable for you.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** By not asking for too much, you're less likely to scare Bob away immediately. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** This allows for potential back and forth, giving you more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $120, it's still below your initial offer of $140 and you believe the product is worth more.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your position:** You're not settling for a price that's significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth.
* **Continue the negotiation:** You have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Explore alternative options:** If Bob's counteroffer is unreasonable, you can still sell to John for $120, ensuring you don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to compromise, but not at the expense of your profit margin.
* **Reasoning:** You justify your counteroffer by referencing the value of the product, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Openness:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, keeping the door open for Bob to potentially accept or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is a good price, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you consider a price of $132? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $132 is close to your counteroffer of $135. Accepting his offer makes sense because:

* **Close to your goal:** You're getting a price that's fairly close to what you aimed for.
* **Higher than John's offer:** This deal is more profitable than selling to John.
* **Minimizes further negotiation:**  Accepting avoids further rounds of back-and-forth, saving time and potentially avoiding a stalemate.

While you might have hoped for $135,  $132 is a good outcome and secures a sale that's beneficial to you."
