"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that works for both of us. How about we set the product price at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure my minimum acceptable price with John."
