"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time I've invested in it.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to get a better offer.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though - I'll sell the product to you for $13800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",13800.0,Alice,5,
