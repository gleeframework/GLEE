"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
