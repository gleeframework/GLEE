Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy for $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation while still being very profitable for you.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
