Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement. In light of your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,087,500 for the product. This amount aims to bridge the gap between our previous discussions and provide a reasonable profit margin for us while still being competitive with your expectations. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer is very close to your desired price point, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there might be a chance to get a lower price, it's unlikely that Alice will go much lower, given the smaller margin and the fact that she's already made a concession.
* **Time Factor:**  The deal might not get any better, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. Buying from John at a higher price is less desirable. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a price that is within your budget and represents a good deal, considering the negotiation process."
