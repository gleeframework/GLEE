Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to give myself room to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counteroffer and we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $700,000, I believe I can get a better price. His offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal happen.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from $900,000, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000. How about $775,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $800,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
