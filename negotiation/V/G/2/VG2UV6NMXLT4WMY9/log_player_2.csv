I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a common tactic in bargaining to leave room for upward adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $6,000 is too low. Could you do $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still a long way from my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",

I'm moving my offer up to my maximum price. This will let Alice know my limit and hopefully encourage her to settle closer to it."
