Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price. If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which is a solid backup plan."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $12,250 to make this deal worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting close, I'm still within striking distance of my target price. I believe I can get a slightly higher offer from Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
