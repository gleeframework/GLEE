"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1800000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1900000, but I'm confident this product is worth the investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $1750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
