"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still a significant gap from my initial assessment.  This product has unique advantages that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and the current market conditions.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
