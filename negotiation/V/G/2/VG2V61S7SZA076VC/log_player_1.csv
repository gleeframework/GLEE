Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for less than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still a significant gap from my initial assessment.  This product has unique advantages that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and the current market conditions.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob seems firm on his $1,400,000 offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
