"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  $120 is too high, and you can get the same product for $150 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a better price than what John is offering. It's a good deal for both of us."
