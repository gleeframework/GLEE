Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's a $30 gap for potential negotiation. 
* **It shows you're confident in the value of the product:** By starting high, you demonstrate the product's worth. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $110 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasizing value:**  The message reiterates that both parties will get a good deal, highlighting the product's value.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price."
