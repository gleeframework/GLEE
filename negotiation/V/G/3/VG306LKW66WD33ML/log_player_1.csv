Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's slightly above my minimum. I believe this will give me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still leaving a healthy profit margin for me. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my initial offering, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith while still leaving me with a decent profit margin. If he rejects again, I'll reconsider selling to John as I'm getting closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's latest offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum. It's a better option to sell to John, securing a guaranteed $10,000, than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
