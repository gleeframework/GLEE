"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  It's also a good idea to keep in mind that Bob can always buy the product from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
