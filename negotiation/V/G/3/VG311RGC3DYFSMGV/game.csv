"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
