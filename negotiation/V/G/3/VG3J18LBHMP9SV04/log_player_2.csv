# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $150 is already a competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

While $125 is a better price than $150, you are still above your target of $100.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
