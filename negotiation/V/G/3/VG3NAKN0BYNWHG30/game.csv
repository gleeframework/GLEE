"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet at $10,750.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $11,250?  This feels like a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away happy.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm also trying to make sure I get a good deal. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
