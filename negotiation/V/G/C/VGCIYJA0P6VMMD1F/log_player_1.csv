Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial price, it sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely justifies the high price by mentioning ""significant value,"" aiming to create a perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's particularly averse to high starting prices, you might adjust accordingly. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might lower the initial price to increase the chance of Bob accepting immediately."
