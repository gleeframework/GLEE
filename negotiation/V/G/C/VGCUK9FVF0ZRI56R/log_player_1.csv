"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  I think it's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob.  If he won't budge, I'll sell to John for $80, which is my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $85 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $85, but I'm willing to go up to $75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. If we can't reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $75 is still below my minimum. How about we compromise at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I need you to throw in some extras or a discount to make it worth my while. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd love to get more, I've already made several counteroffers and there's a risk of him walking away or me running out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal at my minimum price than risk losing out completely."
