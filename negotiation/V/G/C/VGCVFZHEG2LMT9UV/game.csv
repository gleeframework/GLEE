"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the back and forth.  I value your time and I want to close this deal.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for a quick sale. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
