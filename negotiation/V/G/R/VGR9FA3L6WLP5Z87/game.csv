"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my minimum price. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
