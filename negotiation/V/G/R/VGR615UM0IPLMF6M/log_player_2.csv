This price reflects its quality and the exclusive access it offers to our valued customers like yourself. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm sure I can get a better deal elsewhere. I'll reject the offer and see what John has to offer.
