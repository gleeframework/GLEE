Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is significantly above my minimum, it's still far below his perceived value and my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round, aiming to close the gap and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've made a significant concession to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. However, I'm still holding firm above the halfway point between his offer and my initial asking price, ensuring I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I still need the price to come down a bit. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, the price difference is still significant. I'll counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility but aiming for a higher price point. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $950,000."

""product_price"": 1025000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly motivated to buy and has steadily increased his offer. While not ideal, accepting $980,000 provides a significant profit margin over John's offer and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations. It's a strong offer worth accepting at this stage."
