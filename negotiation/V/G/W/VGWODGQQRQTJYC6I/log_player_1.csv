Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer, hoping to get closer to the product's true value for me.
* **Balance risk and reward:** A significantly higher offer might scare Bob away, while a slightly higher offer keeps the deal potentially attractive. 
* **No information on Bob's valuation:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, a calculated risk is necessary. 

This offer provides a good starting point for negotiation. I can then adjust the price based on Bob's response and any information he reveals about his valuation."
