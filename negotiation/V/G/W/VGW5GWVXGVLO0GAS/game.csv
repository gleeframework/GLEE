"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high though.  I'm interested in the product but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer for today. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but that's still a big gap between what I'm willing to pay. To be frank, $800,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
