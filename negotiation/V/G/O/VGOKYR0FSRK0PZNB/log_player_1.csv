Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  My asking price is $2,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to cover your costs, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not comfortable dropping below my minimum.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob. I'll accept John's offer, as it guarantees me the minimum price I need."
