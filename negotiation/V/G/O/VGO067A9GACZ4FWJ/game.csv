"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle - it's a good price for both of us!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise again, but I can only go up to $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and come down to $10,300. This is my absolute best offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. ",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and meet you at $10,250. This is my absolute limit, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,8,
