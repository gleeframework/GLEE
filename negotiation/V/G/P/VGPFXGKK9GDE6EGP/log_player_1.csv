{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. This is based on the assumption that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his own valuation to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum and hopefully acceptable for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below it, and I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before selling to John."

I'm lowering my price further, aiming for a price point that is still above my minimum but potentially more appealing to Bob. This is a risky move, as there's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum, and I don't want to risk another round and potentially get a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired amount."
