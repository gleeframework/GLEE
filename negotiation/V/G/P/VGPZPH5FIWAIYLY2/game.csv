"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $142.50. How about it?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm going to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $147.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",147.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $147.50 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $140. That's my final offer.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm going to offer the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,7,
