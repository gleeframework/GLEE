"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value, I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and give me more room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is key to justifying the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm fully aware that $1,800,000 is a high starting point. This leaves ample room for negotiation, demonstrating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to discuss a more reasonable price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap towards my target price. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to explore a mutually beneficial agreement before settling for a price significantly lower than my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer of $1,400,000, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,650,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firmly:** I'm coming down from my initial offer to show flexibility but I'm not drastically reducing the price. This shows I'm serious about finding a deal but not desperate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is roughly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise. 

This strategy aims to maintain momentum in the negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is a fair price. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 represents a good compromise and a substantial profit above my minimum selling price. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase without risking the deal entirely. Bob's language suggests he's getting close to his upper limit. 

Accepting now secures a strong return and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling."
