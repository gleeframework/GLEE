"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
