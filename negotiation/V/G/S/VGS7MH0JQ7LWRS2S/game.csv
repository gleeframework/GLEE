"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll reconsider.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
