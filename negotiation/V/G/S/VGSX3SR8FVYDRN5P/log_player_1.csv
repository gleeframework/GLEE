"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While there's room for negotiation, accepting a price that low this early isn't wise.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. To move things along, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,350,000.  This is a very competitive price considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is slowly moving towards a more acceptable price point. However, accepting his offer now would still mean losing a significant amount compared to John's offer. Let's try to push a little further.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from, but $1,150,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate seeing you come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,175,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is getting very close to your fallback option with John.  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal, and there's a risk Bob might walk away.
