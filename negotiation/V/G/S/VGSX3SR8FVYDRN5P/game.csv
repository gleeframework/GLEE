"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. To move things along, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,350,000.  This is a very competitive price considering its potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from, but $1,150,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate seeing you come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,175,000 and call it a deal?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
