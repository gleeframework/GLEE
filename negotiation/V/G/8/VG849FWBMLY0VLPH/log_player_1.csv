"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and potentially willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds based on his counter-offer.  The fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I won't lose out if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm not happy with it, I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I need to see if there's room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm also keeping in mind the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum threshold. I need to maintain some leverage and see if I can push for a better price.  I'm also considering the possibility that Bob might be trying to lowball me to see how far I'm willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price too much.  I'm getting closer to John's offer of $1,500,000, so I need to secure a better price if possible.  It's a gamble, but hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. It's far below my minimum threshold, and I'm starting to feel like he's not seriously interested in buying the product at a fair price.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a decent profit, and it's time to move on from this negotiation."
