"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can offer you a compromise at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I can offer you a price of $14,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you halfway, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",14000.0,Alice,7,
