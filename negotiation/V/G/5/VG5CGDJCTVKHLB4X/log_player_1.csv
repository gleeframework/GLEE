Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** Bob, valuing the product at $8,000, might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the offer as a good deal, especially if he believes it will be available for $12,000 elsewhere.

**Important Note:** This assumes you cannot reveal John's offer to Bob. Transparency could impact the negotiation negatively."
