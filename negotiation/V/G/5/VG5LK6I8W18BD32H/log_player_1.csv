Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, as I'm still below my initial target. However,  I've reached a point where I need to be realistic. I've had a few rounds with Bob, and I'm running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer at $870,000 is still a much better outcome than selling to John at $800,000."
