"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. For this round, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her.  There's room for negotiation to bring the price down further. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $725,000 is still a bit too high.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit over budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that acknowledges both of our positions, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still like to pay a little less, Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $750,000.  This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
