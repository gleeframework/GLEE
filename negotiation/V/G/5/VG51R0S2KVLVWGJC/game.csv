"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. For this round, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit over budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that acknowledges both of our positions, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,5,
