"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $800000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $920000 is a good offer, and shows you're serious about this. To make this work for me, I need to come closer to $1000000. How about we meet at $975000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close!  Your offer of $940000 shows you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $960000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",960000.0,Alice,7,
