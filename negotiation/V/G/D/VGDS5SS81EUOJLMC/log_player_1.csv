Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too pricey for me though.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $65 is better than nothing, I can potentially get closer to my goal of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $75 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still do better with more negotiation."
