# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $100. Considering its quality and the time we've spent customizing it for you, I'm extending this exclusive offer at a special price of $150. This is an opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a premium rate, reflecting its true worth. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  There's no reason to pay more than you need to."
