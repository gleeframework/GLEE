"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $600,000. ",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential returns. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant adjustment from my initial asking price and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  This product fits into a specific need for me, and anything above $800,000 just won't work.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away at this point.  If you're willing to come down to $750,000 we might be able to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  I understand this product needs to fit within your budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your constraints.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $850,000 is a substantial offer. However, to be completely transparent, that price point requires me to make a considerable compromise.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, but I need you to understand that this is my bottom line.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
