"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting and negotiating with Alice further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer.  
* It's always a good strategy to take the best deal available, especially when the difference is significant."
