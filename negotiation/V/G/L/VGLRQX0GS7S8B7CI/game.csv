"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair price.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to find a solution. Let's make this work: I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,060,000, so how about $1,030,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
