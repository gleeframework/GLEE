"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances he'll see it as a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, fostering a sense of collaboration in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's significantly below what we know the product is worth to him ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his valuation. We're still in the early stages of negotiation, so there's no need to settle for our minimum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's offer before countering helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making it clear that $1,000,000 is too low, but we're also demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to his initial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,075,000 keeps the price point above our minimum while still offering Bob a substantial discount from his perceived value.  This encourages him to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly still interested and negotiating. While $1,050,000 is closer to our minimum, his statement about needing to ""stay within his budget"" might be a negotiation tactic. We have room for one more counter-offer before considering accepting his price or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to find a solution. Let's make this work: I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1060000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're firm on this price.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're moving slightly closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility but not conceding too much. 
* **Above Reserve:** This price still keeps us comfortably above our absolute minimum sale price.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're approaching the halfway point in the rounds, making a decision in this round more time-sensitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,060,000, so how about $1,030,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. His offer of $1,030,000 is a reasonable compromise, and holding out for more might push him away.
* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,030,000 is still a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of protracted negotiations and secures a good return. We can use this capital for other opportunities. 
* **John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer provides a $30,000 advantage over John's guaranteed offer, making it the more profitable choice."
