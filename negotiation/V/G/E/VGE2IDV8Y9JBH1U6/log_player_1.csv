"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more to you than to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $14,000 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have room to lower the price if Bob counters, but you're also leaving a good profit margin for yourself."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you have a few reasons to reject:

* **Potential for higher profit:** You know the product is worth more to Bob, so there's a chance to get closer to your ideal price.

* **John is a fallback:**  You can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a deal that's profitable and avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
