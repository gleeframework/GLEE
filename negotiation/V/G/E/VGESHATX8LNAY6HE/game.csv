"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
