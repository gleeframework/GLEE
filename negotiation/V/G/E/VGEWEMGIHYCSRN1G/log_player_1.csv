Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you could still end up with a price higher than $15,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you know he's likely not willing to go near your desired price range.

**Important:** It's crucial to remain confident and highlight the product's value to Bob throughout the negotiation."
