"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer and counter-offer. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is not a good option since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and leaves room for Bob to make a profit. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures that Bob gets a good deal and avoids potential complications."
