"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $1,000,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Expressing Budget:**  Mentioning a ""tight budget"" reinforces the idea that you have a limit, making your counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Remaining Positive:** The language is polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. I understand you have budget considerations, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However,  $1,200,000 is still quite a bit above her own valuation of the product.  It's likely we can negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can manage. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see value in the product."",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving in smaller increments now ($100,000) to show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the amount as ""a significant investment"" reinforces the budget constraint idea and adds weight to the counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  We maintain a polite and positive tone, acknowledging her efforts and expressing continued interest in reaching a deal."
