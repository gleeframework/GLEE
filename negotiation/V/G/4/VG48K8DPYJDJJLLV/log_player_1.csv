``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still significantly below your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while also showing you're serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $6,000, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you can't go as low as $6,000, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling flexible, but $8,500 is the lowest I can go right now. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
