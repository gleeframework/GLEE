"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the  $1,100,000 price reflects the true value of this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $1,050,000. I would like to make one last counteroffer at $1,000,000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're considering.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
