"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product truly holds significant potential beyond that. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This reflects both its inherent value and the benefits it will bring to your operations.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product offers exceptional value that transcends a simple price tag. Let's meet in the middle - I propose $1,350,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at the highest price I'm willing to pay, which is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
