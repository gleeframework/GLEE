"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, $1,100,000 is a good compromise and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of continuing negotiations and Alice rejecting further counteroffers, leaving him with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
