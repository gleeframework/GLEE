"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's uniqueness and value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $1400000. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from John for $1200000.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
