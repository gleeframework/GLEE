Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a better price."
