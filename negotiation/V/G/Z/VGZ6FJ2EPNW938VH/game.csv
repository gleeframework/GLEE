,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a great deal for you considering the value, and it gets us closer to a deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While $100 is significantly less than what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to go down to $120 as a final compromise.  If you're serious about buying, let me know if you can meet me there.",120.0,Alice,5,
