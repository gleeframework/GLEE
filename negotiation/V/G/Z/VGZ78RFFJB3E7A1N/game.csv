"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product but $15,000 is pushing it. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is right in the middle of our current offers. How does that sound?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're narrowing down the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'll meet you at $13,000, which is just $500 more than your last offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
