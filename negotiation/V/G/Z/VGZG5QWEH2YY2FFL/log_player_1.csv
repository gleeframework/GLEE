Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""a limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,"" we create a sense of urgency and emphasize the product's worth, potentially persuading Bob to accept the higher price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in conversation rather than just giving a yes or no answer. This opens the door for further negotiation if he counters the initial offer.

Remember:  While John provides a safety net at $120, aiming higher with Bob might land you a better profit."
