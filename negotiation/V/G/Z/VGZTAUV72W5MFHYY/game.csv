"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price just yet.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. It's a significant investment for me, and this price reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the true value of the product. Considering its unique features and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
