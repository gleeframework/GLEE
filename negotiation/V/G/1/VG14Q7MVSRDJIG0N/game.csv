"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a good compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $12,750? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,750 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,900?",11900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,900. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle at $12,500? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a good price, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we make it $12,100? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",12100.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,100. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle at $12,250? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,9,
