"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,000. This is still a significant profit for me, while being closer to Bob's previous offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000,  it's a decent profit and it's likely that we won't be able to reach a higher price in the remaining rounds.  I'm choosing to accept this offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my future counteroffers."
