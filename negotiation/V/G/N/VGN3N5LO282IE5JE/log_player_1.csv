Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but I'll be aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate but I won't accept anything less than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to what I want, and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hopeful this counteroffer will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value and closer to what I would like to get. Accepting his offer means I'll earn more than I would selling to John.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
