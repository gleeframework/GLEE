"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
