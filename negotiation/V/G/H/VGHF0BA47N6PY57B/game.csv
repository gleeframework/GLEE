"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still leaves me some room to make this purchase work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a little high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $10,000.",11250.0,Alice,9,
