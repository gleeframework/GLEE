"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I'm confident this price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
