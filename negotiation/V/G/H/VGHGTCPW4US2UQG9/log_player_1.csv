Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by proposing a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.  It also leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value, and it allows me to get my desired price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,000. How about we try $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value and is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer. To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'll accept Bob's offer."
