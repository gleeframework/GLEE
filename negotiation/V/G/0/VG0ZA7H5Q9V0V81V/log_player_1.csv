Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher price first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as somewhat exclusive, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
