"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. My asking price is $1500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and the opportunity it presents. I'm open to discussion, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. Given the potential value, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1250000, which still reflects the product's true value.  This is a fair offer that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
