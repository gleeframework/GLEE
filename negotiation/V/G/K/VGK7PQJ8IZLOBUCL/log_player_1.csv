"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further but want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to come down further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, it's still below what I'm willing to settle for. I'd rather continue negotiations with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my desired price. There are still a few rounds left, and I don't want to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll accept $1,362,500 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1362500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $1,362,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made several counteroffers, but Bob's offers are still not meeting my minimum price. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  I'm going to sell to John, who is guaranteed to purchase the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
