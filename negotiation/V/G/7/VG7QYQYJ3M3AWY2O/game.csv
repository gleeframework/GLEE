"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but $120 is out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still think my product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,100.0
"I see you're willing to go up to $95, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which is $100. I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",100.0,Alice,5,,
