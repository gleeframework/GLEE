"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
