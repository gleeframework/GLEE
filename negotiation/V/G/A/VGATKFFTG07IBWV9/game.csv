"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you're placing on it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $14,000, which is a significant discount from the original price, but still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both established.",12000.0,Bob,4,
