"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice is the best option.**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is selling it for $135. This means you get a $15 discount, saving you money compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse.**  If you reject, you'll end up paying John $150, which is more than Alice's offer."
