"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a further compromise, but still represents a good profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I've already lowered my price considerably. Rather than risk getting a lower offer or losing a deal entirely, I'll sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further risk."
