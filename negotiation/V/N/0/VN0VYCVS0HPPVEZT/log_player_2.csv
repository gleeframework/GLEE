"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $1,000,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
Alice has come down to $950,000 which is a good deal for Bob. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential risk of losing the product to another seller."
