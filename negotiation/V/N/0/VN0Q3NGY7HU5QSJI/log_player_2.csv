Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
