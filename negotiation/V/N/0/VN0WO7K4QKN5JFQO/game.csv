"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While the product is valuable, I need to stay within a certain budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value this brings.  Would $800,000 work for you to close this out today?",800000.0,Bob,6,
