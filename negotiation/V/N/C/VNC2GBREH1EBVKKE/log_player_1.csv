"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my profits.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product before making further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I need to try and get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum but a considerable decrease from my initial offer. It shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I hope this counteroffer encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I consider acceptable.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to try and get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000.  This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low. I'm hoping this will lead to a final agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, even though it's a slight increase.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and secure a better deal.  I'm feeling optimistic about the possibility of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round to avoid losing too much money.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to make a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still just below my minimum value.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  John's offer is secure and meets my minimum value.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000."
