Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and potentially securing a sale with Bob. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $12,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **It's below my guaranteed sale price:**  If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm still making a profit even if Bob doesn't accept.

This approach allows me to potentially earn a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
