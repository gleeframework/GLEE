"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by you. I propose to sell it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its quality and value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly exceptional! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum value:**  You are willing to pay up to $120.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $110. 
* **John's price:** John is selling the same product for $120.

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price of $120, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. You'll save $10 by doing so."
