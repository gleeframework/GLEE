"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair for both of us. ",150.0,Bob,4,
