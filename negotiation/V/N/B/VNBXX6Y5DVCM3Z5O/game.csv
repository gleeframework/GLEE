"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $900,000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something worth $800,000 to you at a price that offers potential for profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you. It allows you to acquire the product for significantly less than its worth to you, while also giving me a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I am too.  Let's split the difference on this one.  How about $812,500? This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives us both a chance to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. How about $795,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, but I think that's the lowest I can go.",795000.0,Bob,6,
