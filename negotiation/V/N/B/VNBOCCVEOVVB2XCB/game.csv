"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and keeps it a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
