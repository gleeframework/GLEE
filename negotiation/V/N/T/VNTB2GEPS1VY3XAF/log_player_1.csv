Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to raise his offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is not close enough to my desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
