"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high. Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There are 9 more rounds, and buying from John is always an option if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get a good deal. It's a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Alice's first, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. With 7 rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. Buying from John is still a viable option if necessary."

{""product_price"": 800000}
