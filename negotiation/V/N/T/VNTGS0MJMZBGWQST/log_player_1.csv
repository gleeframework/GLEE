Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still keeping you well above your minimum. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
