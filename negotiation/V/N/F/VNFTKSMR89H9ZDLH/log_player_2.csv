"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be of significant benefit to you. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that reflects its value while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price well below its true value.  I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not interested in overpaying for the product. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than what John is offering, I'll accept the offer.
