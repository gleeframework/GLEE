You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $1,200,000. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise as it's still cheaper than buying from John, and I'm likely to save more time and effort by accepting rather than continuing to negotiate."
