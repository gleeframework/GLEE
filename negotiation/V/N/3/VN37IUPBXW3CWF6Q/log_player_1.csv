"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to hopefully maximize my earnings. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  By starting at $12,000, I can potentially make concessions in later rounds if necessary. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I want to close the deal with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000.  This knowledge helps me to set a firm bottom line for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unreasonable, it opens the door for further negotiation. I can use this opportunity to try and find a middle ground.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price from $12,000 to $9,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $9,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer of $5,000 and my minimum price of $15,000.  It's a significant discount from my original price but still higher than his offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $6,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for compromise:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to compromise. This suggests that further negotiations might lead to a more acceptable price.
* **John is still an option:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, which allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob without risking a complete loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a compromise, this time moving to $7,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Realistic offer:**  $7,500 is still considerably higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, suggesting I'm serious about finding a solution. It's also a significant distance from my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties. This builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that. I can tell we're getting close to a deal. How about $6,800?  That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob's message indicates that he's willing to negotiate further and is getting closer to a deal.  This suggests that a deal might be possible in future rounds if we continue to negotiate.
* **John is a safe option:**  If we can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me a safety net and allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $6,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $7,150.  Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, demonstrating my desire to find a solution. 
* **Splitting the difference:**  $7,150 represents a near-perfect split of the difference between my last offer of $7,500 and Bob's current offer of $6,800. This makes the offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting finalizing the deal. This might motivate Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make the offer more appealing and to continue building rapport."
