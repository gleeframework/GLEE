Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a strategic decision.  While $7,500 is closer to John's price, we're in a strong negotiating position. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Let's see if we can get her closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that. I can tell we're getting close to a deal. How about $6,800?  That's a firm offer from me."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
``` 

We're pushing a little closer to our goal, but using a ""firm offer"" adds weight and suggests this is our final offer. It might encourage Alice to accept or propose something very close."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $6,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $7,150.  Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and this offer is a good compromise. It's below John's price and a good deal overall. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
