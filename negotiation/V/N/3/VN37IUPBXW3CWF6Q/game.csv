"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price for my product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that. I can tell we're getting close to a deal. How about $6,800?  That's a firm offer from me.",6800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $6,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $7,150.  Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say?",7150.0,Alice,7,
