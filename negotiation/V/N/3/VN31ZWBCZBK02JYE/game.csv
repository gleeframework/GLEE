"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
