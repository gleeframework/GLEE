"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob's ideal price. There's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This would be a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest offer, I believe it's reasonable to move forward with a price closer to your proposal. Therefore, I suggest a price of $887,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice's offer of $887,500 is significantly closer to Bob's desired price point and represents a good compromise. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob continues to reject offers, he risks Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or even withdrawing the offer completely. He also runs the risk of losing the product to John for a higher price.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice. Bob has already made significant progress and can secure a good deal without further risk."
