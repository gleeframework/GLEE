"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for the product, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
