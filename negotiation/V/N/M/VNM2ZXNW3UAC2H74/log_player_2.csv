Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer again, trying to bring the price down closer to his target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial offer. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm prepared to consider $1,400,000 as my final offer.  This price point reflects the significant value this product holds while recognizing your interest.  Please let me know if this works for you, as I'm also evaluating other opportunities.

Alice's final offer of $1,400,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. While the negotiation has progressed, it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower.  Bob's best option at this point is to purchase the product from John for $800,000 to ensure he stays within his budget."
