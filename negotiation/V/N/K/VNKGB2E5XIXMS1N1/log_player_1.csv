Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm confident it can exceed the value you anticipate. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We aim for the highest possible price Bob is likely to accept, exceeding John's offer.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values it at $1,000,000 and we need at least $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly while still exceeding our minimum.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to entice Bob while justifying the price."
