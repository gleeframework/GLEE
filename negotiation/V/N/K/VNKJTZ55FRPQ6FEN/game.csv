"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
