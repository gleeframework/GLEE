"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice or by buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can likely negotiate a lower price or buy the product from John for a cheaper price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's target price and more than what John is offering.  It's time to cut his losses and move on to a more advantageous deal."
