"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's first offer is quite high, considering her product's value to her is much lower. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will deliver the returns you're looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but we're still quite a bit above her value for the product. There's space to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

This counteroffer:

* Acknowledges Alice's movement on price, building goodwill.
* Proposes a price exactly between the previous two offers, suggesting a spirit of compromise.
* Keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well below John's alternative."
