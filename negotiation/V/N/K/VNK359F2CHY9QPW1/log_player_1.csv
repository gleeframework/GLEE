{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal (he values the product at $1,500,000), while still securing a profit for you well above your minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation if he counters, but it's a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will deliver the returns you're looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and still leaves room for profit. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
