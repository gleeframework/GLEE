"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product, valued at $10,000 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $9,500. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is your limit.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you within your budget and allows you to negotiate further with her or secure the product from John."
