You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,000, but I can meet you in the middle at $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

At this point, it's likely that further haggling won't result in a significantly better price.  $9,250 is a reasonable compromise and saves a good amount compared to John's offer."
