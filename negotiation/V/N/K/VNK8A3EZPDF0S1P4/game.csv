"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $13,000. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $12,750. This is my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
