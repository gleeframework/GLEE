Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $13,000. How about we meet at $12,500?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $12,750. This is my final offer.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000. At this point, John's offer of $10,000 is the best deal and ensures you don't waste more time negotiating."
