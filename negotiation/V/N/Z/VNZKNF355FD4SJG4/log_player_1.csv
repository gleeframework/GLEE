Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a high offer to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows you to potentially secure a price closer to his perceived value of $8,000 while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,"" you create a reason for the high price without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate down. You can gradually decrease the price, aiming for the highest amount above $15,000 that Bob is willing to pay."
