Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, we have a strong fallback position. Starting negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""significant opportunity"" and offering it to Bob first, we create a sense of value and exclusivity. 
* **Targeting above Bob's value:** The $1,300,000 price point aims to capture some of the potential profit margin between Bob's valuation and John's guaranteed purchase price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. If Bob rejects the offer, we can confidently accept John's offer knowing we aimed for the best possible outcome."
