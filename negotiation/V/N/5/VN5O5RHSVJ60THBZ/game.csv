,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget of around $1500000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1600000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $1650000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value while still allowing you to stay within your budget.  What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still confident that this product's value is more than $1600000.  Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1625000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value we both recognize in this product.  I'm hoping you'll accept and we can finalize this deal.",1625000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget considerations, I believe we can reach a fair agreement at $1600000. I hope this price point aligns with your valuation of the product, and we can move forward with the transaction.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
