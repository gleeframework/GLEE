"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as you've said the product is worth $1000000 to you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900000, so how about $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is very close to your own assessment of the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal at this price, it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $1000000, so how about $987500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
