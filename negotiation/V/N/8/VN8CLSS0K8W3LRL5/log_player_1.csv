Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases the chance of securing a higher profit. The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's negotiation tactics and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your offer in subsequent rounds of communication."
