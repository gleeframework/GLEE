Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The lowest price you'll accept is $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal appealing enough to accept.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him balk, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're highlighting the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves you a healthy profit margin ($350,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount from his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message's tone suggests room for discussion, but you've set a strong initial anchor point.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more accommodating approach could be beneficial."
