"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $950,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
