"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110** is a starting point that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. 
* This allows for negotiation room and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* My message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to what Bob is willing to pay, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have more rounds to work with and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is my final offer - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$95** is a compromise that still gives me a profit, but is closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more attractive.
* The message emphasizes the compromise and frames it as a ""final offer"" to add pressure and incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$92.50** is a middle ground between Bob's offer of $90 and my previous offer of $95. It's still within my desired profit range.
* The message highlights the compromise aspect and emphasizes fairness to make it more appealing to Bob."
