{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for a potential compromise. It also positions the product as valuable and opens the door for a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
