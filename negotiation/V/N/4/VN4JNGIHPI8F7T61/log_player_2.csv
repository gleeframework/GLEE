"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He's willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice's offer is above that. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While there's a chance he could negotiate further, there's no guarantee. Buying from John guarantees the product at his desired price."
