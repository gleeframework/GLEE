Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a very competitive offer for something with this much potential upside."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations. To be frank, anything over $800,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I think that's a fair offer.
