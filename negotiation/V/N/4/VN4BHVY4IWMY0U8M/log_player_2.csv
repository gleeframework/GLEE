"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the initial price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a very competitive offer for something with this much potential upside. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations. To be frank, anything over $800,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant disparity in our perception of the product's value. I've already lowered my price considerably. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000. Her language suggests this is her ""final offer"" and she's firm on her perceived value. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John makes more sense than risking further negotiation with Alice for a potential savings that may not materialize."
