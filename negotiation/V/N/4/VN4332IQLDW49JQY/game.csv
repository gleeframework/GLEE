"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000. I can sell the product to you for $8,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
