"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This tactic:

* **Establishes a negotiation range:**  Alice now knows we're serious about a lower price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to move up while still staying below our $8,000 limit.
* **Tests Alice's flexibility:** Her response will give us valuable information about her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our range, but her offer is still above John's price.  We should counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to $8,000 without going over."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We've increased our offer by $1,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise but also showing that we're serious about a lower price point.
* **Target Range:**  $7,000 keeps us significantly below Alice's offer while aiming for a price that's appealing to us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We still have John's offer as a backup, so we're not desperate to accept anything above $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000. I can sell the product to you for $8,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price of $8,000. This is the same price John is offering, so there is no benefit to continuing negotiations or buying from John. We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
