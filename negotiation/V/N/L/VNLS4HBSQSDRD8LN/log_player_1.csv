Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still offer Bob a price that's appealing.
* **Create Urgency:** Telling Bob about a potential public listing creates a sense of urgency, making him less likely to stall or negotiate down. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** $11,500 is a price that gives Alice a significant profit over her minimum, while still saving Bob $500 compared to his perceived value."
