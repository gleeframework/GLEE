Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,500,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I want to find a way for us to make this deal happen. I'm willing to significantly adjust my price to $1,100,000.

If we can't agree on a price close to this, I'll need to explore other options.
