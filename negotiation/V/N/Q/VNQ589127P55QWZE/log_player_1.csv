Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.

I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $800,000."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
