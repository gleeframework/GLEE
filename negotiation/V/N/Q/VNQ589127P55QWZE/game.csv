"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $800,000.",875000.0,Alice,3,
