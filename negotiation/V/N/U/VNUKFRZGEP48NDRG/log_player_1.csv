Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any benefit from the deal. A slightly lower price can encourage him to buy.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a little, selling to him is still more profitable than selling to John for $100."
