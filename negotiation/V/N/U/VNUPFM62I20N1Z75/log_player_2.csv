"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to see how much she's willing to negotiate.  This gives me room to move upwards while still staying well below my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to my price, $85 is still a bit high. I'll try countering again to see if we can settle closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand $70 is low, Alice. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price that's a fair compromise, moving closer to her $85 while still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down quite a bit, and $81 is a reasonable price. It's a good compromise, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price again.  I've managed to save $19 compared to John's offer!"
