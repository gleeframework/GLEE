I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John, but it gives Bob a chance to get a good deal if he values the product higher.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm aiming for a large profit. 
* **Risk Management:** While this is a higher price, it's still within reason.  
* **Motivating Bob:** A higher price might motivate Bob to accept, especially if he values the product significantly higher. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
