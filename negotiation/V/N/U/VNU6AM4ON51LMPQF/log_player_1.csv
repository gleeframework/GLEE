Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a significant profit. Let's see if we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us and allows for a healthy profit on your end. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations fail. It's strategically better to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I have 6 rounds left, and there's a good chance I can get a higher offer from Bob or still sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is the better strategy at this point."
