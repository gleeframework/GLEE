"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a significant profit. Let's see if we can close this quickly.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal before we run out of time.
