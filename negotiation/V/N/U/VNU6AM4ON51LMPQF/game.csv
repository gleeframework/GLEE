"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us and allows for a healthy profit on your end. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
