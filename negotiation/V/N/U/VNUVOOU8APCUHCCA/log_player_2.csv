"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm only comfortable paying $12,500 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,250 is closer to his ideal price than $15,000, he's still willing to negotiate further. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $13,100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price, but he needs to consider the opportunity cost. If he rejects this offer, he risks Alice walking away, leaving him with no choice but to buy from John for $15,000.  A $13,100 price is a good deal, especially given that Alice is unlikely to go lower."
