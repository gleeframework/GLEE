"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could meet you halfway at $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd be willing to consider $1,800,000, which is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While moving closer to Bob's price shows flexibility, holding firm for another round might push him closer to the $1,900,000-$2,000,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's make this simple: $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits this product will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer achieves several things:

* **Strong Stance:** The ""final offer"" language conveys seriousness and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Strategic Concession:** It shows movement from $2,000,000, potentially encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Profitable:**  We're still well above John's guaranteed $1,500,000, maximizing potential profit.

Now the ball is firmly in Bob's court to see if he's truly motivated to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,900,000 to $1,800,000, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,850,000 is a significant profit margin above our $1,500,000 minimum and a good deal overall.
* **Bob's Movement:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our price, indicating strong interest.  His ""final offer"" from Round 5 likely had the desired effect.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging this out further has diminishing returns.  We risk Bob losing interest or lowering his offer, especially since he's met us more than halfway from his original offer."
