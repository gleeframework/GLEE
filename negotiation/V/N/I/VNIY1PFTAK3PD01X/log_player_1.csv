"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember your bottom line. You value the product at $120, and John is offering that price right now.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better outcome, and it might even waste valuable time."
