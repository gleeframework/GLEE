{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both parties. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for some potential profit for Alice. Bob is hoping this counteroffer will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  There's still room to negotiate a better price, and Bob should continue to try and reach a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum budget of $10,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000.  This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is very close to Bob's maximum budget, there's still a $900 difference. Bob should try to continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his goal.  If he fails, he can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but he wants to see if he can squeeze out just a bit more.  This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  He hopes that Alice will see this as a reasonable price considering the back and forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget, but there's still a small margin for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a price even closer to his $10,000 goal.  He's been persistent and has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a chance Alice might be willing to meet him halfway. If this attempt fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10825}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making one final attempt to get a price closer to his target. He's proposing a price halfway between his previous counteroffer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to minimize his expense.  He's hoping Alice will recognize that he's serious about getting the product and will agree to this small concession. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will proceed to buy from John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is very close to Bob's budget, there's only one round left.  Bob has tried hard to negotiate a lower price, but it's not clear Alice is willing to go any lower. It's better to be certain of the product and secure it for his budget by buying from John."
