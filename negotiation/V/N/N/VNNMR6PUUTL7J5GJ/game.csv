"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. As we discuss the price, I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for the product is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This is a fair price for both of us. ",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,750. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12,800. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12800.0,Alice,5,
