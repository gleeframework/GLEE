Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to negotiate up to $11,500.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You won't accept anything less than $12,000, so this gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** A bold initial offer can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Remember:**  Be prepared to negotiate and potentially accept a lower price if you want to close the deal with Bob. However, you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to your minimum of $12,000, but it's still below it. There's room to negotiate further, and you're not desperate to sell to Bob since you have a guaranteed $12,000 from John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Increase your potential earnings:** You have the chance to push Bob closer to your price point.
* **Show you're serious:**  Rejecting his offer indicates you're not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Maintain your leverage:** You can leverage the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($11,000). 
* **Showing flexibility:** This shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Keeping leverage:** You're still above Bob's initial offer, which keeps some leverage in your favor. 
* **Not accepting the minimum:** You're still holding out for a price closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to continue negotiating. How about $11000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stuck to his initial offer of $11,000, indicating he's unwilling to budge further. At this point, it's unlikely you'll be able to convince him to go higher. You've already made concessions and are only $1,000 away from your minimum.  

Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option for you:

* **Guaranteed profit:** It ensures you get your desired price.
* **No further negotiation:**  You avoid potentially wasting time in further negotiations.
* **Higher earnings:**  It's a better financial outcome compared to accepting Bob's offer."
