{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully closer to a price Bob might be willing to pay. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I won't go too much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer.  I'm getting a sense that Bob is willing to pay a bit more, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $12,000. This is my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he rejects, I'll have to accept John's offer to avoid losing any money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not worth the risk of him rejecting again.  I'm guaranteed $12,000 with John, and I don't want to risk losing money."
