Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product is worth more to me than to Bob. If Bob rejects again, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. While I still want to make a profit, I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not the highest I could have gotten, but it's a safe and guaranteed sale."
