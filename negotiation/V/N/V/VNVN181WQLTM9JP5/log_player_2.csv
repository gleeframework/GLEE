# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $900,000. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her current price range.  While we're getting closer, the difference between her offer ($1,025,000) and John's price ($800,000) is too substantial to ignore. It's time to cut our losses and secure a guaranteed good deal with John."
