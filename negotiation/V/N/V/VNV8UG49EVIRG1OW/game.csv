"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This price is fair given its value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This price still represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
