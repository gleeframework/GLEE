Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming higher. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to $1,600,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,550,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or walking away."
