Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially secure a higher price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, showing willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my ideal price point, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, and while it's still lower than my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the back-and-forth. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a significantly higher price."
