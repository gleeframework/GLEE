Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so any price above that is a potential profit for you.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a small ""discount"" while still securing almost the maximum profit. This leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
