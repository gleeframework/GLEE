"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $25,000. What are your thoughts on this?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $25,000 is way above what I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than its value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $20,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I can't go any higher.  Is that something you could work with?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal. How about $17,000? This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
