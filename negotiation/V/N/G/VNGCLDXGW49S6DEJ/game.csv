"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $95 is a little higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  Let's get this deal done!",87.5,Bob,4,
