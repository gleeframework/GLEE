"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the purchase.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about we settle at $625,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $625,000 is a compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to go up to $675,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
