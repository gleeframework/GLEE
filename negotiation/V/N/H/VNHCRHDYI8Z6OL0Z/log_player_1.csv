Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $985,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that recognizes the value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but $985,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob is clearly reaching his maximum budget. Accepting $975,000 provides a substantial profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
