"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm flexible, and I'd like to see if we can reach an agreement.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle at $128.75?  Let's see if we can close this deal.",128.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $128.75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",130.5,Alice,5,
