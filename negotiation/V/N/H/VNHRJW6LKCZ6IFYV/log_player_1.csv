Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $140 is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $10 buffer allows for potential counteroffers and still ensures a profit for me.
* **Alternative buyer:** The threat of selling to John for $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Alternative buyer:** Selling to John for $150 is always a viable option, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm flexible, and I'd like to see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer in the middle:**  A counter-offer of $132.50 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Highlighting flexibility:** Mentioning flexibility implies a willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle at $128.75?  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $128.75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive, giving me a chance to potentially secure a better price.
* **The threat of John:** Selling to John for $150 is still a viable backup plan, providing a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob falls through."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $128.75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 130.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  The offer of $130.50 is a small concession, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the justification for the price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message uses a positive tone and encourages Bob to accept, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
