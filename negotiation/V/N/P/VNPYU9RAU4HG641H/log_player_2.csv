{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. Bob can still try to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. $9,000 represents a compromise, potentially appealing to Alice while still allowing Bob to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range. Accepting the offer secures a deal and saves Bob money, even if it's not the absolute lowest price possible.  There's a good chance the negotiations will continue to go lower, but there's also a risk that they might not, and Bob might end up with a worse deal or having to buy from John."
