Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and to reflect its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range that's highly profitable for you.
* **Consider Your Backup:** While John offers $800,000, getting a significantly higher price from Bob is ideal. 

This offer balances ambition with the understanding that pushing Bob too hard might make him walk away."
