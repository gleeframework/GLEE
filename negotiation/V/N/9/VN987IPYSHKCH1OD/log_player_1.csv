Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, so you're starting above your $10,000 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $11,500 leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to make a profit. 
* **It's open-ended:** The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation, making him feel more involved and potentially more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above your minimum of $10,000, it's significantly lower than your desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested and willing to negotiate, so there's room to reach a price you're happy with. 
* **Potential to reach a better price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your target price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $11,500. Be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?  This price still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a fair return."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise, showing that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not willing to go too low.
* **Middle Ground:**  $11,000 is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a logical starting point for further negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the potential profit for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your ideal profit margin. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** There's still room to negotiate, and you can potentially reach a higher price by making another counteroffer.
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:**  You can always sell to Jhon for $10,000 if the negotiation fails, so you're not taking a huge risk by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer to Bob.  You could try splitting the difference again, or you could offer a price closer to your $11,000 offer from the previous round. Remember, your goal is to get as close to $11,500 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there on $10,750.  Let's compromise one last time - how about $10,900? This would give you a good price and still allow me a decent return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer signals a willingness to finalize the deal while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Small Concession:**  It's a small concession from your previous offer, showing flexibility while staying above your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefit to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.

**Strategy:**

By making this final counteroffer, you are demonstrating that you are serious about closing the deal but that you also have a firm price point.  If Bob rejects this offer, you have the option of selling to John, which is a safe fallback option."
