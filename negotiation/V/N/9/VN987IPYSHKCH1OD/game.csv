"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?  This price still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a fair return.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there on $10,750.  Let's compromise one last time - how about $10,900? This would give you a good price and still allow me a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
