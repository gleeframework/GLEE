"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I can justify. Would you be open to $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $795,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",795000.0,Alice,5,
