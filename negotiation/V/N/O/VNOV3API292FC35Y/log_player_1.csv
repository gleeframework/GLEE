Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I want to maximize my profits, but I'm also aware of the potential for a counteroffer and the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $95. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm aware that I'm running out of rounds, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $87.50 is a decent price, and it's still higher than what John is offering. It's time to close this deal."
