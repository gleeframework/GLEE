"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by offering it to you for $11000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price remains at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really pushing the limit of my budget at $11000.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $10500.  This shows I'm serious about buying, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $10500, which would be $10750.
