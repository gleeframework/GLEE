"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's plenty of room for negotiation. It's unlikely she'd offer her maximum price right off the bat."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to go down to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate. We'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price to see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $780,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is getting close. Alice seems firm on staying above $800,000. Let's test her resolve with a counteroffer just below that threshold to see if we can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close to a price I can work with.  How about $795,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this."", ""product_price"": 795000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but I need to stay above that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay in the range of $790,000 to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly holding firm around that $790,000-$800,000 range.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield significant savings. Accepting at $790,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of her withdrawing or the negotiation stalling."
