"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum is $8,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500, which is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you see in the product and allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement on this.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this. If not, I'll need to reconsider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
