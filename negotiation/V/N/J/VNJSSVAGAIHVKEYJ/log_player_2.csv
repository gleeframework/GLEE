"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept this offer without attempting to negotiate a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there is time to explore alternative offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum is $8,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further since I still have 7 rounds left and there's a chance I can get closer to my target price.  Also, I have the option of buying from John for $8,000, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500, which is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you see in the product and allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $9,200 is still outside my budget. I'm determined to get the product for $8,000 or less. Since I have the option of buying from John for $8,000, I don't need to settle for a higher price. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a better offer.  There are still 5 rounds left, so I have time to explore alternatives."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this. If not, I'll need to reconsider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above my budget of $8,000. With only 3 rounds left, there's a high chance we won't reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids any further haggling."
