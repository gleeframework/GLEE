"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and this offer reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a price closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  How about $10,750?  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to get at least $10,900 for it.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close:**  $10,900 is only $400 above Bob's ideal price of $10,500. 
* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" implying she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Jhon's price is higher:**  Buying from Jhon would cost $1,000 more than Alice's offer.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to buying from Jhon.  While he could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then having to pay more to Jhon is too high."
