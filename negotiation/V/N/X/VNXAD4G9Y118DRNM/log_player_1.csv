I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is still above what the product is worth to him, but it's also lower than what I would get from John. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer, but also ensures I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd get from John. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is still a price that is above what the product is worth to him, but it's closer to his offer and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. It's also closer to my target price than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob and ending up with an even lower price isn't worth it. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
