Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me. I believe this will be a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $135. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and his offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John. This ensures I gain a profit and avoids further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or an impasse."
