"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is Bob's maximum price, there's no information yet about the product's value to Alice. There's a possibility that Alice is willing to sell for less, making it beneficial for Bob to try and negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** A 25% reduction is significant but not overly aggressive, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product, but makes the price the main point of discussion.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The ""What do you think?"" phrasing keeps the conversation open and avoids shutting down the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice has moved from $10,000 to $8,500, indicating a willingness to compromise. However, there's still room for Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **Seeking the best deal:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open to potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $7,500. 
* **Avoiding the ""split the difference"" trap:**  Alice's suggestion to ""split the difference"" can be a negotiation tactic, but Bob should resist the pressure to accept it blindly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within the negotiation zone:**  Bob avoids drastically changing the price and stays within a reasonable range.  $8,000 is a small step back from Alice's offer but still shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Focus on a win-win:** The ""find a price that works for both of us"" language emphasizes a collaborative approach, potentially making Alice more receptive to a compromise.
* **Confidence without being pushy:**  Bob expresses confidence that a deal is possible without coming across as overly demanding."
