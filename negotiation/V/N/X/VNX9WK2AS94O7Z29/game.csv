"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $7500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
