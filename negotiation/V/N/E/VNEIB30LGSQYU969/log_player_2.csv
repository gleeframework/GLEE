Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still being reasonable for me. Let's close this deal and move forward.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm committed to closing this deal. Let's find common ground.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product.  This shows my commitment to the deal, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $940000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $940,000 is still outside of my budget.  I've already negotiated for several rounds and am getting closer to my goal, but I'm concerned we may not be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  

Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget, and it's a much safer option at this point."
