"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $18,000. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $18,000 is a price that Bob might consider, especially since he values the product at $10,000. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and set the stage for a potential negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've made a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed based on his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's interested in the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Staying Committed to Value:** I'm committed to getting at least $15,000 for the product. Selling to John at that price is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still being willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to see if we can find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue the conversation. This shows I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to go lower. 
* If Bob's offer gets too low or I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $14,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I want to close the deal, I won't compromise on my minimum price.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** We are getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for one more counteroffer:** I still have rounds left and I want to see if Bob will budge.  I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being willing to compromise.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll likely sell to John for $15,000 to avoid losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, as $15,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price.
* **Clear Communication:**  I've explicitly stated that $15,000 is my minimum, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Last Chance:**  I'm giving Bob one last chance to accept my offer. If he rejects, I will sell to John to avoid any further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've secured a sale at my minimum price.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $15,000.  It's not ideal to lose out on a potential negotiation with Bob, but it's the most financially secure option at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to sell to John to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  This avoids any further risk and ensures I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
