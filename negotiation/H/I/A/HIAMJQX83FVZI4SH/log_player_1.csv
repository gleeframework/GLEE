"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth to make the price seem more justifiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the highest price possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can push Bob further. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable agreement. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better deal. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing that John is willing to buy the product for $800,000 gives me the security to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Move:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground that's more appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product while being a more reasonable price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price slightly, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $875,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a logical point for compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While lowering the price, I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the figure. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to accept and close the deal. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to secure a price closer to my initial offer while still keeping the negotiation open.  I believe this counteroffer increases the chances of Bob accepting and avoids the risk of further counteroffers and rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $860,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $40,000 below my initial asking price and only $60,000 above my minimum.  This is a good deal considering the limited number of rounds remaining. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price or potentially losing the deal entirely if Bob becomes frustrated.
* **Security with John:** I have the security of selling to John for $800,000, which allows me to take a slightly lower price from Bob if it secures the deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and maximize my profit within the remaining rounds. I'm willing to take a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for to avoid further negotiation and potential risks."
