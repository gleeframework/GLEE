"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me at the moment.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to keep some room for profit.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to buying from John at $120, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. How about $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to John's offer, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. This is my final offer, and I really think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
