Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is a starting point:**  It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but allows for negotiation room.
* **Enthusiastic but not desperate:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's value, but doesn't sound desperate for a sale.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation process open.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me at the moment.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to keep some room for profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer but not too high:**  $130 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from the previous offer. It's still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  The message frames the offer as a ""good price for both of us,"" making it sound more appealing than simply sticking to my original price.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  The message asks for Bob's opinion, keeping the conversation going and potentially leading to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John at $120, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. How about $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $128 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to take a slight risk and continue negotiating with Bob.  John is a backup option, but there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to John's offer, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. This is my final offer, and I really think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.  
* **Middle ground:**  I'm proposing $130 again, which is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Reiterating value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $130 is a fair price.
* **Direct question:**  I end with a direct question to force Bob to make a decision. 

This approach aims to signal that I'm serious about getting a deal close to my minimum price, while still leaving room for a slight compromise."
