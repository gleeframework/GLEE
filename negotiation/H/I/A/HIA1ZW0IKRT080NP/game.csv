"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth $9,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see you're eager to get this product. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the $10,500 you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
