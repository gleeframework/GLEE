"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price just for you, Bob! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $140, while John wants $150. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer is below that, meaning Bob is still getting a good deal."
