"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? This gives us both a solid deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
