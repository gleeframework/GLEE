Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product for $11,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning a higher perceived value ($12,000), I'm anchoring Bob's perception of the product's worth, making the $11,000 seem like a better deal.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
