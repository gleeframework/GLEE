Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While we know Bob only values the product at $80, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $120 suggests you might be willing to go even lower, potentially enticing Bob to counter-offer.
* **Balancing potential profit:** This strategy aims to get a higher price from Bob while still ensuring a sale (at $150 to John if Bob refuses)."
