"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a decent profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $10000. This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good deal and allowing me to meet my minimum target. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000. How about we try $9750?  It's a reasonable compromise, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9900 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm still able to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9900 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $9800. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you accept.  Let me know your decision.",9800.0,Bob,8,
