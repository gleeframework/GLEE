Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can lower your price slightly, but you still want to aim for a price closer to $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is slightly less than the initial offer, it's still above your minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit without risking a long negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John for $80."
