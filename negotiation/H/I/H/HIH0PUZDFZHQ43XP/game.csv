"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I've decided to make a counterproposal. Given the unique features and benefits of the product, I am willing to accept $14,000 for it. This still reflects a premium value compared to the market rate, while being more accessible to you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm committed to acquiring your product, but I'm only able to go up to $13,000 at this time. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and enables us to move forward with the purchase.",13500.0,Alice,5,
