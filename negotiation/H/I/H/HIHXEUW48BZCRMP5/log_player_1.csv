Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,500. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  This ensures I make a profit.
* **Lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000).**  This gives Bob a significant incentive to accept the offer.

By offering this price, I aim to maximize my profit while still making the sale to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
