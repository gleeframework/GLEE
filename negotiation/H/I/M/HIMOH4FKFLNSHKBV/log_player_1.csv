Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I still have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $130, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $145? This gives you a good price, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $145. How about $137.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $140. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your bottom line, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $138. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $138 is still below my minimum value of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, I've already reached my bottom line and only have 4 rounds left. With John offering a guaranteed $150, it's more beneficial to sell to him now rather than risk losing out on a better deal."
