"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  If you're not willing to budge, I'm going to have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
