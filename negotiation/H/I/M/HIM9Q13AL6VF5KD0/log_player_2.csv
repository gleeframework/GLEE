"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle on $85? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

At this point, Alice has shown she's unlikely to go much lower. It's a better decision to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
