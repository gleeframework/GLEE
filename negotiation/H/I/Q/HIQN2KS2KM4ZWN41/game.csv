"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,500. Would you be willing to work with me on that?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product and the fact that I've already come down from my initial price, I'm willing to accept $13,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",13750.0,Alice,5,
