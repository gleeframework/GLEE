Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range could benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but always keep your $1,000,000 safety net in mind!"
