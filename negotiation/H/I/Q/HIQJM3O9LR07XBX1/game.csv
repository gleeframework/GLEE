"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is still a little low for me. How about $9500? That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is closer, but I'm still not there. I'm going to offer $9400, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9200.0,Bob,6,
