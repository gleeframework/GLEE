"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise and keeps the deal alive. I'm also trying to create a positive tone and highlight the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not where I want to be. I'm confident that I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which gives me a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still not there. I'm going to offer $9,400, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation has stalled. Bob's offer is only $200 higher than his initial offer, and I'm not comfortable accepting anything less than my minimum value of $12,000.  Since I have the opportunity to sell to John for $12,000, I'm going to take that offer."
