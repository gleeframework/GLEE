"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value and a great opportunity for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident it'll generate far more than that in return. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. Considering its value to me and our previous discussion, I'm willing to offer $980,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal quickly. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution!",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 still doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This price point acknowledges the value you'll gain and allows me to reach my target. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $1,020,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects our earlier discussions.  Considering the value to me and our previous offers, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  Let's reach an agreement!",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to propose a final counteroffer of $1,010,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!",1010000.0,Alice,7,
