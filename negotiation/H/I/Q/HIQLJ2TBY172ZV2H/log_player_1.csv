Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's make this happen!

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. Considering its value to me and our previous discussion, I'm willing to offer $980,000.

This price point acknowledges the value you'll gain and allows me to reach my target. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
