"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value and a great opportunity for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's a good starting point, but we have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident it'll generate far more than that in return. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, there is still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. Considering its value to me and our previous discussion, I'm willing to offer $980,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal quickly. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution!"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 still doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This price point acknowledges the value you'll gain and allows me to reach my target. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. We're nearing the middle ground, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $1,020,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects our earlier discussions.  Considering the value to me and our previous offers, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  Let's reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to propose a final counteroffer of $1,010,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal entirely or needing to purchase from John at a much higher price is too high. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that is still within my budget and significantly lower than John's price."
