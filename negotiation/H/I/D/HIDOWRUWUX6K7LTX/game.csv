,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the unique value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
