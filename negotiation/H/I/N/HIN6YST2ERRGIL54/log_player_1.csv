Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $20,000, I leave room for negotiation while still maintaining a comfortable margin above my minimum price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Stating I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't know the product's value to Bob, suggesting it would be ""of great value"" is a subtle way to entice him.

This strategy allows me to explore Bob's interest while setting a high initial price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping my minimum price and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my minimum price, but I'm not interested in risking a protracted negotiation that might lead to a lower offer. I'm guaranteed $15,000 from John, so it's more efficient to accept his offer and move on."
