"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can drop to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation. You can try to push for a price closer to your limit of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stay at $850,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. I've tried to meet you halfway, but I need to be upfront â€“ I won't go below $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a deal.  You are still a significant distance from John's price of $800,000, but there's room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I want to make this happen. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
