Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a potential ""discount"" to feel good about while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer is significantly above John's $120 offer, ensuring that even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to get a better deal than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is a decent offer, it's still below your initial asking price and leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Bob is Interested:** Bob's message indicates he's interested in the product, suggesting he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Better Than John:**  $130 is still better than selling to John for $120, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Small Concession:** By coming down $5, you're signaling flexibility without drastically reducing your asking price.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $135 is still a profitable price for you and significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can we try $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $128 is a reasonable compromise and only slightly below your ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob could walk away.  
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids further delays and secures a solid profit over John's offer."
