"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of the product.  Bob can potentially still get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, and it's becoming clear that she's not willing to go much lower. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that Bob could end up paying more than $10,000 if he keeps rejecting offers.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John at $10,000, as this is within Bob's budget and guarantees the purchase."
