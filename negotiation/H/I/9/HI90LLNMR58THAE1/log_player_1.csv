Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than it does for me. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) allows me to start the negotiation significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still ensuring a significant profit for me. 
* **Justification for the price:** By highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, I aim to justify the high price and make it seem reasonable. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
