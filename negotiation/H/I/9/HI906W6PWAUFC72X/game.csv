"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, $800,000 is quite a distance from what I can accept.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price reflects its true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,350,000. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a significant gap from what I'm looking for.  This product offers unique advantages and I wouldn't be able to let it go for less than $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
