{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$125 is above my minimum and it seems Bob is firm on that price.  It's better than selling to John and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
