"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product's value to you, but it's worth significantly more to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,4,
