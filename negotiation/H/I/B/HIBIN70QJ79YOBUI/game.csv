,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable,  $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm afraid $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
