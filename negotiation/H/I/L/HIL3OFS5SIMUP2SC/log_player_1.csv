"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to make him more eager to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm giving Bob space to counteroffer, which is essential to get the best possible price.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob is close to my minimum price, but I can still aim for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm not in a rush to close the deal.  I want to see if I can get closer to $100. 
* **Potential for Gain:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to get a better price in future rounds.

**Next Round Strategy:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer ($100) but still below what I know the product is worth to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob that he's still getting a great deal at this price. 
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:** By making a counteroffer instead of accepting his price, I show I'm not desperate and I'm willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider how much more I can push for. If he accepts, I've secured a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I'll stick to my original offer of $90. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firm on $90, and I'm still hoping for a bit more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $90 is a good price, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $95.
* **Time Limit:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll likely counteroffer again, perhaps with a slightly lower price than $95 to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aim for a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a little to $92. This is a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer to show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to $95.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good price"" aspect for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a compromise to avoid selling to John for $80.

**Next Round Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my options. I might lower my price further to $90 to avoid selling to John, but I'll also consider the time limit and my potential loss if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
