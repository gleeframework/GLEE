Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my bottom line of $15,000, I still believe I can get a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:**  I'm confident that I can get closer to $14,000 with a counter-offer. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's a risk Bob will walk away, it's a calculated risk.  I still have the option of selling to John if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,000 is a good price, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Strategic Counter:**  $13,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, but it gives him a good incentive to accept.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm aware that the longer the negotiation goes on, the higher the risk of Bob walking away. This counter-offer aims to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost below $13,000. Would you consider selling the product for $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Bottom:**  Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to his perceived value and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation increases the risk of Bob walking away or my losing interest.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit that's significantly higher than Bob's offer. While it's less than my initial goal, it's a secure and quick transaction. 

Given the circumstances, it's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid the potential of further negotiation with Bob."
