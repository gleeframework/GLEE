"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer leaves room for me to increase my price while still staying well below my $10,000 limit and hopefully getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still closer to her desired price. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving and aim for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

I'm proposing a price that's directly in between our previous offers. It shows I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm also aiming for a significant saving compared to John's offer and a price that's closer to Alice's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference – I'm willing to accept $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to get a good return. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm happy with, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get the price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $8,000 even? It's a win-win – you get a good price, and I get the product I need."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

I'm going straight for what I believe is a fair compromise in this round.  It meets Alice at her value for the product and gives me a significant discount compared to John's offer.  There's still some wiggle room if needed, but this feels like a strong position to land on."
