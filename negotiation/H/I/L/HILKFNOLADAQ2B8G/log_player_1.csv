{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've set the price at $11,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, to maximize our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the message leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wishes, allowing for some flexibility.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so we don't want to accept anything less than that.

By offering the product at $11,000, Alice is aiming to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob, while still ensuring a profitable sale."
