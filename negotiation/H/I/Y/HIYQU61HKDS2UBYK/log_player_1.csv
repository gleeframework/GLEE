Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my highest desired price. While I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate up to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings, and if Bob rejects, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is still more than Bob values the product, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob at this price."
