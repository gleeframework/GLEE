"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I think the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which may make him more receptive. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust the price in subsequent rounds.
* **Always keeping John in mind:** If the negotiation drags on or Bob becomes unreasonable, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest.  There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price in further rounds.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:**  If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a lower price:**  I'm decreasing my price from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob to motivate him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob still rejects, I can further adjust the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $140 is still below my $150 threshold. 
* **We're nearing a deal:**  The negotiation is progressing, and Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer. It's likely we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I want to keep some leverage and avoid giving in too quickly. 
* **John is still an option:** I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation stalls or Bob becomes unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your position, but $140 is still a little low for me.  How about $155?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm decreasing my price again, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $155 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not losing money.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, which may make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving room for a final deal:**  There's still room to negotiate slightly if Bob is unwilling to go to $155.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:**  Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, I've already made several concessions and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, potentially below my minimum. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 6, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to sell to John.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, the certainty of a quick sale to John outweighs the potential risks of further negotiations with Bob."
