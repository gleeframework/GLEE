"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will deliver on that value. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. Consider this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Her message implies she's eager to sell and  wants you to believe this is her best offer. By rejecting it, you signal that you're serious about the purchase but looking for a better deal.  This might prompt her to counter-offer with a lower price closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
