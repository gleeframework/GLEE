"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",680000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $680000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $725000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to my business. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $720000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $690000. I'm willing to make another adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $710000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",710000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, but I'm still not convinced that $710000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $680000 for it, which is the same price I offered in round 2. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to my business. Can you consider this offer?",680000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go back to the price we discussed in round 2. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $705000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",705000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $680000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to my business. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to make a decision soon.",680000.0,Bob,10,
