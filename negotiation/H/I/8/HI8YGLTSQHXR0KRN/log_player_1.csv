Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but may still be attractive to Bob.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price.  $10,000 is well below my minimum value, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also shows that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value, and I'm happy to accept it. However, I've been through a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge much further. I'd rather not risk another round of negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so I'll take that option."
