Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes a fair price, creating a positive starting point.
* **Flexibility:** By leaving room for negotiation, I'm open to a counteroffer and can adjust my price if needed.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can likely negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,450,000 to $1,350,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I remind Bob that $1,350,000 is still a good deal considering the product's value to him.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much. 

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the deal. 
*  If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,350,000.
* **Acceptable profit:**  While it's not my ideal price, $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away or lowering his offer further.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of a deal falling through."
