"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and see the potential in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000, as it's still below my minimum price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still too high.  Given that I have a reliable alternative with John offering the product for $800,000, it's more beneficial to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase the product from John. This guarantees me a lower price and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
