Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he counter-offers. It also positions me to walk away and sell to John for a higher price if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, it's still much less than what I could get from John. I will reject his offer and counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value but is lower than my initial offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum. It also keeps the negotiation moving without completely closing the door on a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price in the end.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum and is the most advantageous choice at this point."
