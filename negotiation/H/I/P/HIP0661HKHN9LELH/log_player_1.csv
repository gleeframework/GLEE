Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing some progress, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John at that price. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:

}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that he's willing to pay up to $800,000 and can buy from John at that price.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures you maximize your profit."
