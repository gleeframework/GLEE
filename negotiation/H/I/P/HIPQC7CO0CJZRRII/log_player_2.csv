"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's a good chance you can get it for less. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price."
