"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle - would you be willing to pay $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we settle on $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $9,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  I could go down to $11,500, but that's my best offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this. $11,500 is tempting, but I'm trying to stick to a hard limit. Would you be willing to do it for $10,000 even? That's the absolute most I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
