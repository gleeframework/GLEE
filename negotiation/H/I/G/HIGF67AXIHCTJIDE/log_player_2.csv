"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000. It's important to start negotiating from a strong position.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially bring the price down to a more acceptable level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've already factored in some room for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and you should continue trying to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and see if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While she's showing willingness to negotiate, you should continue pushing for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you an opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you steadily increasing your offer.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm coming down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it's only slightly above what John is offering me directly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  While you've made progress in negotiations, you're running out of time and rounds.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for your maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or exceeding your budget."
