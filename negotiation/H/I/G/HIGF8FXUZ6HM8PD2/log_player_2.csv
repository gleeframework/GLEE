"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you might really like. I'm asking $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. While this is a good price, you can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100?

Alice has come down to $100, which is still a good deal for you.  It's worth it to accept and avoid further negotiation, especially since John is charging $120."
