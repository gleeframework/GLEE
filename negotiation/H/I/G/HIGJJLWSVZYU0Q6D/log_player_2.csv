{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further compromise.  $600,000 is still a good deal for Alice, considering her $1,000,000 valuation."

```
