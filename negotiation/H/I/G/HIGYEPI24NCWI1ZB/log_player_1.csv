"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **First Round:**  It's a good idea to start with a significant offer in the first round, as you have more leverage at the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $120?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is showing interest but is willing to pay above my minimum ($100). This suggests I can likely get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's a good practice to reject the first counteroffer, especially when it's close to your minimum. This gives the impression you are firm in your price and encourages further negotiation.
* **Time to Counter:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I can afford to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down a bit, but $120 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $135 is still above my minimum ($100), so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and respectful to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my counteroffer of $135.  
* **Time is Running:**  We're already in round 4, and with 10 rounds total, I need to start closing the deal. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum of $100, and there's a chance I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
