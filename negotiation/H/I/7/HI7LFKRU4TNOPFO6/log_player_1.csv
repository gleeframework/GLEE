{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A starting offer of $140 represents a 16.6% markup, which might be appealing to Bob if the product is desirable or in demand.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives us some space to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob counters, while still staying above our minimum of $120.

**Important Note:** If we knew more about Bob's negotiation style or how much he desired the product, we could adjust our offer accordingly. This offer is based on the information available and aims to balance profit with the risk of losing the sale to John."
