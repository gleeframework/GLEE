"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?  I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is substantially lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be respectful while clearly stating that the initial price is too high. 
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $10,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice is now only $1,000 above John's offer. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go slightly lower, especially since she seems eager to sell.  Rejecting might encourage her to meet you closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. Let's make this simple â€“ I can do $12,000. It's a fair offer, and it saves us both from further negotiation."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting John's Price:**  This counter-offer matches John's offer, making it clear that this is my bottom line. 
* **Direct and Efficient:** The negotiation has progressed well, and it's time to be direct. This offer conveys that I'm serious but won't go higher.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  By offering my final price, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to accept a slightly lower price or risk losing the sale."
