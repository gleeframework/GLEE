"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?  I believe that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's make this simple â€“ I can do $12,000. It's a fair offer, and it saves us both from further negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,4,
