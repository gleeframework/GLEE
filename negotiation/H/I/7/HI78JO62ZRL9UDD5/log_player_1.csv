Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but gives some room for negotiation. It also leaves room for you to potentially make a counter-offer if Bob rejects, while still remaining above your minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?  I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's make this simple â€“ I can do $12,000. It's a fair offer, and it saves us both from further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth taking this deal rather than risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob, or having to sell to John for a slightly higher price."
