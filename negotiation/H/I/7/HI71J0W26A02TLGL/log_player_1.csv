Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and potentially even go down a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000.  If he rejects my offer, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable price for Bob. I'm willing to be flexible but won't drop below $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'd rather keep negotiating and see if I can get a bit higher. If he rejects again, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite high enough.  I'm not willing to risk going another round, as I could end up with an even lower offer.  It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
