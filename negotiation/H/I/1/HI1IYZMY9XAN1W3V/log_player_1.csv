"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, significantly above Bob's perceived value. This is a common strategy in negotiation to establish a high anchor point. While Bob is unlikely to accept this offer in the first round, it sets the stage for future negotiations and allows me to gradually decrease the price while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. Selling to John at this stage would result in a lower profit compared to potentially securing a higher price through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit closer to my target value. By progressively decreasing the price, I hope to entice Bob to accept in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John would provide a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,400,000. This continues to show flexibility and signals my willingness to negotiate.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer but allows for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.  I believe this is a good balance between potentially reaching an agreement with Bob and not giving up too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 6, with only 4 rounds remaining.  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm concerned that we might not reach a profitable agreement within the remaining rounds.  Furthermore, John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit.  Given the limited time, it's strategically better to sell to John at this point and secure a guaranteed high profit."
