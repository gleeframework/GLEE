"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'll make a new offer: $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go below $8,500, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John."
