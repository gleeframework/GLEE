"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in my product.  $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair price for my product. Let's compromise at $102. It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's a price I can live with.",102.0,Alice,5,
