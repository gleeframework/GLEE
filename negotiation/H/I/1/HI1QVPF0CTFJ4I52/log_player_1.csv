Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.  I'm confident I can get at least $150, so I'll be happy to accept anything above that.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll see what his counteroffer is and then decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is too low for me. While it's more than Bob values the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $160. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit lower.  I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John.  John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
