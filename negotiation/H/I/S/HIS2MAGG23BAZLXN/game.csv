"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, however, $14,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could be flexible and come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
