Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000.
* This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000, giving me potential for a higher profit.
*  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so there's no risk in setting a higher price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes no knowledge of Bob's potential value of the product. If I had any information about how much Bob might be willing to pay, I could adjust the offer accordingly."
