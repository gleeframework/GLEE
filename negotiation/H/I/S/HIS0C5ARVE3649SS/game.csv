"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to go down to $7500?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $7500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
