"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. This price is above Bob's valuation but allows room for negotiation. It also positions me well against John's offer, giving me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is closer to my minimum but also acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate.  I still have time to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John is a safety net, but I'm not ready to use it yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum and reflects Bob's increased willingness to pay.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to make a final offer close to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum. I have four rounds left and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm countering with $1,025,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'm hopeful that this will be enough to get Bob to agree to a deal. We're getting closer, and I still have three rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but given the situation, I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of time, and Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $990,000. This offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and while I could continue negotiating with Bob, I risk losing both deals. Selling to John guarantees me a good return, and ensures I don't miss out on a valuable opportunity."
