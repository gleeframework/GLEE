"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $175. How about $125? This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $175 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",162.5,Alice,5,
