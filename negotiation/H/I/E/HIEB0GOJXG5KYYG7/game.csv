"Alice, $19,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that's within my range and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
