"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer allows for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product,  reflecting its value and my current financial constraints. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and the price of $850,000 is a good compromise. Buying from John would cost more, and further negotiation might not get Alice to go lower.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to John's price."
