Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning you believe the product is ""worth a great deal,"" you subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind as potentially higher than his perceived $100. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

While there's a chance Bob will reject the $120 offer, you have a guaranteed backup with John at $100. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
