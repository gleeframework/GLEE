Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, the message implies I might be open to a counter-offer from Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum."
