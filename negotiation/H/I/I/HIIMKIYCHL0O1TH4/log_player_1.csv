"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** $130 is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's friendly:**  Opening with a friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to your offer. 
* **It's open-ended:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still keeping the negotiation going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested but I'd be willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can secure a higher price.  

**Next steps:**

You can counter Bob's offer with a price somewhere between $110 and $130.  You could also try to explain why your product is worth more than $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  I understand $110 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $120?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still being profitable for you. 
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for the price (""leaves some room for both of us"") can help Bob understand your position and potentially encourage acceptance.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking for Bob's thoughts again keeps the conversation going and allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Good Compromise:** $115 is a fair compromise.  It's closer to Bob's preferred price while still offering you a profit above your minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  You're already 4 rounds in.  Continuing to negotiate risks reaching the 10-round limit and being forced to sell to John for less.
* **Positive Outlook:**  Bob's message suggests he's willing to continue negotiating.  Accepting his offer now might encourage him to be more flexible in future transactions."
