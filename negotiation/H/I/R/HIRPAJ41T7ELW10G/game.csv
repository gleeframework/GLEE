"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $12000, which is my maximum budget for this purchase. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $15000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched on the budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13500, Bob. However, I was thinking that the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $13500, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a bit more on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $14250, which is a bit above your last offer. Would you be willing to consider that?",14250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I'm not willing to go any higher. If we can't meet on that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000. Is there any room for flexibility?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about considering buying from John. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $13750. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13750.0,Alice,9,
