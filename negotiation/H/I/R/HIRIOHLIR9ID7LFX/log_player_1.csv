Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,000,000 as my initial offer. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves me a good profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits to Bob. It also opens the door for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This strategy balances risk with reward.  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but there's also a chance he'll accept. 
* **Negotiation:**  By starting at a lower price, I create room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have a backup buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's still a great price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my ideal outcome. I'm not desperate for a sale and believe I can potentially get a better offer from Bob or secure my full asking price with John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. This allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Leverage:**  I have John as a backup, giving me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob may be willing to raise his offer, especially if he sees that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased my offer by $50,000 to $950,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain some leverage.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes a fair compromise. It also acknowledges Bob's counteroffer while maintaining my position.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I believe $950,000 represents a reasonable middle ground between our initial positions.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm showing flexibility, I haven't completely caved. This keeps Bob engaged in the negotiation and encourages him to potentially come up in price.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good compromise.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **Potential for Loss:** There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing out on the deal entirely.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $920,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially since I have a backup buyer in John.

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement and avoid potential losses."
