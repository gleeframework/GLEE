"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $10,250. I'll sell the product to you for $10,375. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  I'm still hesitant about $10,375.  How about we meet in the middle one more time at $10,200?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10200.0,Bob,8,
