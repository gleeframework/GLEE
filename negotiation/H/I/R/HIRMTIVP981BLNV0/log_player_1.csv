"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a strategic opening offer. It's high enough to potentially push Bob towards accepting, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so this offer is not unreasonable. 

This also keeps the option open to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer. This is a safety net and helps to guide the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than what I would like to get for the product. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better price. It's better to risk a few more rounds than to settle for a price that doesn't maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Bob is now offering the price I proposed in the last round, which means we are essentially at a stalemate. It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly higher price, and with only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal and having to sell to John for $1,000,000 increases. Accepting the offer guarantees a profit, and it's better to lock in a good deal rather than risk losing out on a potentially higher price."
