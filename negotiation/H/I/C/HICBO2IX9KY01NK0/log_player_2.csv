"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for $1000000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still far from the minimum you're willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the logical step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me and your asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $150,000 reduction shows you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay a fair price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Acknowledge their initial offer:** Showing respect for Alice's initial offer helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere. 
* **State your justification:** Briefly explaining your reasoning for the counteroffer makes it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects both the value of the product and my need to secure a fair price.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to your ideal price but still higher than your counteroffer. You're still aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving in your favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value of the product.  Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  By proposing a price halfway between your last offer and Alice's, you show a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Reiterate your desire for a deal:**  Stating ""Let's reach a deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to consider your offer seriously.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  A friendly and cooperative tone helps keep the negotiation amicable."
