"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, which may encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing it as a discussion (""What do you think?"") to signal my willingness to negotiate. 
* **No Counteroffer:**  I'm not immediately providing a counteroffer as I want to see if Bob's initial reaction is positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, given its value to me and your asking price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer would be a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe choice, but I want to maximize my profit, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects both the value of the product and my need to secure a fair price.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm staying firm on the price being above $850,000 but acknowledging Bob's position. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on finding a solution. 
* **Remaining Optimistic:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value of the product.  Let's reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has offered $900,000, which is a fair price considering his previous offer and my counteroffer.
* **Profitable Deal:**  This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it's within the range I'm comfortable with.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to squeeze a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating."
