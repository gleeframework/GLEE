Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I'm extending an exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $95? This price reflects its high quality and the significant discount compared to the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can likely negotiate a better price or stick with buying from John."
