Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob's Perspective:** He gains a product worth $800,000 to him for a price that's still significantly below its true value to you.
    * **Your Perspective:** You earn a profit of $300,000, which is more than the guaranteed profit from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the offer."
