Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $115 is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum ($100) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob:**  By not starting at the highest possible price, I create the opportunity for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts my offer. 
* **Alternative buyer:** I have John as an alternative, so I'm not pressured to accept any price below $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob is clearly willing to pay $105, which means the product has value to him. 
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price closer to my desired $115.
* **Alternative:**  While John is willing to pay $100, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I'm confident I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $110 is a compromise between my initial $115 and Bob's $105. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:** By mentioning that it's a fair price for *both* of us, I subtly remind Bob of the product's value. 
* **Maintaining my position:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate."
