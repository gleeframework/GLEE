"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $170. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
I'm coming down from my initial offer but still keeping the price higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm also trying to signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob and that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle on $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, and $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80, which I think is a fair offer considering John is also selling it for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's not clear if we can reach a higher price. It's better to secure the sale to John for $150 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
