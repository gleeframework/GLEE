Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** The price is below what Bob is willing to pay, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This gives you room to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum, but also provides a safety net with John's offer. 

By starting with this offer, you create a good starting point for negotiations and maximize your chances of getting a good price while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him. There's room for negotiation, and by rejecting his offer, you can attempt to increase the price.  The potential gain from a counteroffer outweighs the small difference between Bob's offer and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise: 

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate, but not settling for a price significantly lower than your initial offer.
* **It's still below Bob's perceived value:** You're leaving room for potential further negotiation, but also making it clear that you're not willing to go below a certain price.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that might be appealing to Bob while also ensuring you get a fair price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet your expectations, and his offer is getting closer to John's offer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing. Selling to John at $8,000 ensures a sale and is only slightly lower than Bob's final offer.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better outcome, and it could risk losing both buyers."
