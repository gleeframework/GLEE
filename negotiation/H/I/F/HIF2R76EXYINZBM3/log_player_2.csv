"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,350,000.  Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  Since you know Alice values the product at $1,200,000, this price leaves a $50,000 cushion for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and you're closer to reaching a deal with her than John.  Rejecting this offer gives you another chance to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that shows you are serious about buying the product but are still trying to get a good price. You are still well under your budget, but it also gives Alice a chance to close the deal without a large loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you've been successful in getting Alice to lower her price, it's becoming clear that she's not willing to go much lower. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still within your budget and ensures you get the product without further delays. You can still get the product for a price you're willing to pay and avoid potentially getting stuck in a longer negotiation with Alice."
