"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $14,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's more than what John would pay, and it's close enough to my desired price.  I'll accept it and move on."
