"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still potential to get a better deal, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to come down in price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a measured approach, gradually increasing his offer. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but also wants to get the best possible price.  $13,000 is a good compromise point, closer to Alice's last offer but still below his maximum value."
