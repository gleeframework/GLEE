Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my preferred price. I've already been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems like we are getting close to a stalemate. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
