"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fair Offer:** While $1,750,000 is above Bob's value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone can encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's above his initial valuation, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I have 8 rounds remaining. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a safety net.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, but I'm willing to try and negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,300,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he has increased his offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I have 6 rounds left, so I can continue to push for a higher price. 
* **John is a safe alternative.** If the negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit of $1,500,000. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to be firm in my desire to get a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm continuing to reduce my price, but at a smaller increment than before. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Stronger Tone:** I'm using a more assertive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and the significant compromise I've already made. This aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my expectations.
* **Finality:** The message suggests a desire to finalize the deal, adding pressure on Bob to accept the offer.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have 5 rounds remaining to negotiate further or sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you are willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a considerable amount for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the expense of earning a substantial profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 4 rounds remaining, and Bob has clearly demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  There's still potential to push for a higher price.
* **John is the fallback:** If negotiations fail, selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,000,000) and my previous offer ($1,150,000). This demonstrates a genuine attempt to find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting that both parties can be happy with the outcome.
* **Closing Pressure:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects, I still have three rounds left to negotiate or sell to John for my minimum desired profit."
