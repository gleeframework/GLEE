,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you are willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a considerable amount for me.  Let's meet in the middle. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
