{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$8,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.** I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **I have 10 rounds to work with.** This gives me ample opportunity to find a more favorable price. 
* **Buying from John for $15,000 is a last resort.** I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but not unreasonable. 
* A 25% reduction from Alice's initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. 
* I'll see how Alice responds to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.** She's moved closer to my counteroffer.
* **$7,500 is still a bit high for me.** I believe I can get it lower.
* **I still have several rounds left.** This gives me room to continue negotiating. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** I want to explore all options with Alice first."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* A $500 increase from my previous offer shows a genuine attempt to reach a middle ground. 
* It's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to my price point.** She's only $200 higher than my last offer.
* **We're nearing the halfway point in negotiations.**  I'm willing to close the deal now to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my next offer. 
* **$7,200 is a decent price.** It's still well under my maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  This deal is looking good, and I don't want to risk losing it."
