"Bob, I understand your hesitation, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
