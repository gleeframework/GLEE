Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential that justifies a higher price.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,600,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.
