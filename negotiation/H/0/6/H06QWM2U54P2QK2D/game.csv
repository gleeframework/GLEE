"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential that justifies a higher price.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has potential, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true potential of this product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
