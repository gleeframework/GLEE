"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $1,400,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. It's too early to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential that justifies a higher price.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has potential, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to a price point that would provide significant profit beyond John's offer. I'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true potential of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,450,000 provides a $250,000 profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
