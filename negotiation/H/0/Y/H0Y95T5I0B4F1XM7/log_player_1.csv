{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum threshold. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is tempting, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge from his $105 offer.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further haggling."
