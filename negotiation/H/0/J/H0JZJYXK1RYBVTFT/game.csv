"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $22,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $19,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product. It's truly worth it. How about we settle at $17,000? That's a significant compromise from my initial asking price.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a good compromise. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution.",14000.0,Bob,6,
