# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
