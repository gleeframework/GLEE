"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
