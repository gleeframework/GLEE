Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120, and she's trying to inch the price back up. It's not worth continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John."
