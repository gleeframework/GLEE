"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to get closer to Alice's minimum value of $8,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a significant concession.  This price is still within Bob's budget, and buying from Alice at $11,000 is much better than paying $15,000 to John. While a lower price is always preferable, the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again, or even losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the product at a price that is still favorable to Bob, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
