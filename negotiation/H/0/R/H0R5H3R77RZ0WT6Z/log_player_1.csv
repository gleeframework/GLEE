Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $120, I am leaving space for Bob to negotiate down towards his perceived value of $80.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will also help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he immediately rejects a price significantly higher than his perceived value, it might suggest he's not a serious buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I'm only able to offer $95 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent offer, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested but trying to secure a good deal.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've reduced my price significantly to signal flexibility and a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Targeting Midpoint:** This counteroffer aims for roughly the midpoint between Bob's offer ($95) and my previous ask ($120).  
* **Maintaining Profit:** I'm still securing a profit above my minimum, leaving room for a final small concession if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Profit:** $100 is a solid profit margin above my minimum of $80. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away, especially since he's already moved closer to my price. Accepting now guarantees the sale. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further time and effort spent on negotiation."
