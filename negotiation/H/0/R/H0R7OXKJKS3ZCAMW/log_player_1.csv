**Reasoning:**

While I could push Bob further, accepting his offer of $1,750,000 is a strong outcome.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still securing a substantial profit over John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal today is worth more than the uncertainty of further negotiation and the potential of Bob walking away.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his eagerness to close the deal."
