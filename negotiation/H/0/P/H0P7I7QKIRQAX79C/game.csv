"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable,  your asking price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. Would you be open to $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is very close, but to be honest, anything over $900,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $912,500?",912500.0,Bob,6,
