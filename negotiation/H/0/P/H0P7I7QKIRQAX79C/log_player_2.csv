It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer.  At this point, the potential savings from further haggling are relatively small.
* **Time Constraint:**  We only have a few rounds left. If we push too hard and Alice becomes inflexible, we might end up having to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Good Deal:** $920,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price. 

It's always tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, but in this case, accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of missing out on the product entirely."
