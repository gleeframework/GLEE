"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. You should definitely counter-offer, aiming to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is quite steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's strategic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual maximum ($8,000). This gives you room to negotiate upward while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly indicates that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $6,000 leaves a $2,000 buffer before reaching your maximum. It also provides a substantial difference from Alice's initial ask, encouraging her to engage in the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $17,000 is still way outside your budget. It's clear you need to continue negotiating firmly to guide her closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could stretch to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're moving up slowly ($1,000) to demonstrate willingness, but not too much that you reach your maximum too quickly.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating ""$7,000 is the most I can do,"" you're establishing a firmer boundary while still leaving a little room for negotiation. 
* **Direct and Open:**  The message keeps the tone direct and honest about your budget constraints, encouraging Alice to make a realistic counter-proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a good deal.  To be honest, $7,000 is still quite low, and I'm getting close to what John is offering.  I'd be willing to make a significant move down to $14,000, but that's my absolute best. If this doesn't work, I think it's best we part ways. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Even though Alice dropped her price, $14,000 is still significantly more than your $8,000 limit and what John is offering.
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice mentioning John's offer is likely a tactic to pressure you into accepting a higher price. Don't let it sway you too much.
* **One Last Push:** You can try one more counteroffer, but be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand where you're coming from. However, to be completely honest,  $14,000 is just too far out of my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,500, but that's really the absolute maximum I can afford.  If that doesn't work, then I appreciate your time and I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous, signaling a willingness to compromise, but it firmly establishes your upper limit. 
* **Transparency:** Being transparent about your budget and your alternative (John's offer) might motivate Alice to make a deal.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** By indicating you have other options, you show you're not desperate to buy from her at any cost. This can be crucial in getting a favorable outcome, even if it means walking away."
