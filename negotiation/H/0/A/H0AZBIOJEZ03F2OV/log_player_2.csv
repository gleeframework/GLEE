**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $775,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge much, and we could end up with a less favorable outcome.  

Here's why accepting now makes sense:

* **Significant Savings:**  $775,000 is a substantial discount from both her initial offer of $900,000 and John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunities. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings from further negotiation are likely small compared to the risk of Alice becoming less flexible or us running out of rounds."
