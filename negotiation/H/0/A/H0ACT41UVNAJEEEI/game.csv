"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can find a good solution here.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",9000.0,Bob,4,
