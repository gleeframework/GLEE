{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has room to counter without going below your minimum.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By opening with a price that isn't your absolute maximum, it shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can find a good solution here."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that I'm still interested in selling to him, but I'm not willing to go below a certain price.
* **It's closer to my desired price:** $9,250 is significantly closer to my desired price of $10,000, meaning I'll make more profit if we agree on this.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, there's still room for a small compromise on both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's close to my desired price of $10,000, and it's definitely better than selling to John for $8,000.  It seems like Bob is genuinely interested in the product, and we're close to a deal. I'm going to accept his offer."
