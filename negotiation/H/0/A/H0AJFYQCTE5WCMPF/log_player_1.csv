Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it gives us room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's above my minimum price of $80 and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
