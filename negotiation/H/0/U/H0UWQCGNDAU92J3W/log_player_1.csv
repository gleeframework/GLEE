{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $20,000 for it, which is a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the product's value and make the price seem attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can negotiate a better deal. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to make this work.  This product is truly unique and offers great value, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but not by too much. This shows I'm serious about selling, but not desperate.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value, subtly justifying my higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focused on finding a solution that benefits both of us.

This strategy aims to maintain leverage while still appearing open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17500. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 away from my initial asking price of $17,500.
* **Avoid Risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer entirely. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 would mean leaving $1,000 on the table. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a profitable price, minimizes the risk of losing him, and maximizes my earnings compared to selling to John."
