Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a significant amount. I'll consider my options.

Since I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John.
