"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my true maximum ($80). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and potentially get a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My offer is low enough to signal that Alice's initial price is way off, but not so low that it seems insulting or like I'm not serious. 
* **Goal in Mind:**  My ultimate goal is to buy the product for the lowest possible price, ideally well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to pay $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $130 is still significantly higher than my $80 maximum and even further from my ideal target price.
* **Slow Concession:** Alice's counter-offer, while moving in the right direction, is a relatively small concession. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate further.
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the option to buy from John for $80, which protects me from being pressured into a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $70? That's a pretty significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:**  I'm increasing my offer to $70, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This new offer is still below my $80 maximum but getting closer. It puts pressure on Alice to make a more substantial move.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer (""significant jump"") to make it seem more reasonable and encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to the 10-round limit, and I need to start moving the negotiation toward a price I'm willing to pay or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're trying to reach a fair price, $70 is too far off from what I can accept.  This product is valued much higher, and I need to get at least $110 for it. That's a significant price drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Price:** $110 is still significantly above my maximum budget of $80. Accepting this offer would mean overspending.
* **Slow Progress:** Alice's concessions are very slow. At this rate, we're unlikely to reach a price I'm comfortable with within the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer:** The option to buy from John for $80 is looking increasingly attractive.  

I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious about my budget and that time is running out. The next counteroffer will be crucial in deciding if continuing the negotiation is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget, and $110 just doesn't fit into it. My final offer is $75. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with a different seller. I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer to create urgency and signal that I'm serious about my budget.  
* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $75 to show some flexibility, but it's still well within my $80 limit.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm clearly stating my intention to buy from John if Alice doesn't agree. This puts a bit of pressure on her to compromise.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm emphasizing the time constraint to push for a quicker decision.

**This counter-offer achieves several things:**

1. **Sets a Clear Boundary:**  Alice knows exactly where I stand.
2. **Creates Urgency:**  She has to decide now or risk losing the sale. 
3. **Maintains My Position:** I'm not backing down from my budget.

This strategy gives me the best chance of getting the best possible deal without overspending."
