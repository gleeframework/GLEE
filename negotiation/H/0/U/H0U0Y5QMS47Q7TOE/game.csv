"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to pay $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $70? That's a pretty significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're trying to reach a fair price, $70 is too far off from what I can accept.  This product is valued much higher, and I need to get at least $110 for it. That's a significant price drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget, and $110 just doesn't fit into it. My final offer is $75. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with a different seller. I need to make a decision soon.",75.0,Bob,6,
