"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $120 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This still leaves me some room, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
