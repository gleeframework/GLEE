"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There are still 9 rounds left, and you have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $5,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also hoping to gauge her willingness to compromise early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from $6,000 to $6,500, but it's still worth negotiating further.  While $6,500 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. There are still several rounds left to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $5,500. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below her last offer. This strategy helps me maintain control of the negotiation while still leaving room for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I have several rounds left and can still potentially get a better price.  While buying from John for $8,000 is a safe option, I'm determined to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $6,000. This is a significant move towards Alice's last offer of $7,000, but it's still within my budget.  With only 4 rounds left, I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to overpay. I'm hoping this will lead to a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,500 is getting close to my maximum budget, but I still want to try and negotiate a lower price. I only have three rounds left, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise. It's risky, but I'm willing to take the chance and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $6,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still trying to stay under my $7,000 limit. With only two rounds left, I need to make a significant move to show Alice that I'm ready to agree, but also that I won't be swayed by her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is exactly my maximum budget and the same price as John's offer. With only one round left, I'm running out of time and leverage to negotiate a lower price. It's a risky move to reject Alice's offer, as she might not counteroffer, leaving me with no option but to buy from John at the same price. Therefore, the best course of action is to buy the product from John to guarantee the purchase and avoid the uncertainty of the final round."
