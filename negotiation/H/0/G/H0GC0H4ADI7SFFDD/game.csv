"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,
