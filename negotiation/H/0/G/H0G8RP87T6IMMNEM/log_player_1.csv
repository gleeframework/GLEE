Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
