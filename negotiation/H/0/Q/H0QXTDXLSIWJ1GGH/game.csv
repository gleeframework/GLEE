"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique product at a reasonable price.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. I'm confident this price is attractive to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
