"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll be impressed once you learn more about it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique product that will set you apart from the competition. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I have a strong negotiating position and can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $600,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for compromise. I've used a strong but respectful tone in my message, highlighting the value of the product while staying within my budget.  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique product at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. I'm confident this price is attractive to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm taking a more aggressive approach in this round, pushing for a price closer to my ideal while still leaving room for negotiation.  By offering $700,000, I'm demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution while making a substantial increase from my previous offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of reaching an impasse or Alice deciding to walk away. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of paying John's higher price."
