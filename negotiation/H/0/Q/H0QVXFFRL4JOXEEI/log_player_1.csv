Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget limitations.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move this forward, would you consider $1,500,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget, but we still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer. Let's see if a counteroffer slightly above Bob's price entices him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on this. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm very serious about acquiring this product, but my absolute maximum is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reiterated his maximum budget multiple times and hasn't budged. It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed sale at this point to avoid the risk of Bob not budging and potentially losing both deals."
