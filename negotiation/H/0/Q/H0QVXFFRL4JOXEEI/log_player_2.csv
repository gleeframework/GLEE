Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget limitations.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move this forward, would you consider $1,500,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
