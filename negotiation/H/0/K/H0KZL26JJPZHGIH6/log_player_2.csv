"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $9,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $9,175. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer of $9,175 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly better price, but it also risks Alice becoming firmer in her position or the deal falling through. Accepting now secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
