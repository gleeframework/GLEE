Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility and willingness to hear Bob's thoughts, making it more likely he'll engage in the conversation. 

By offering the product at $20,000, you're aiming to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that's potentially appealing to him."
