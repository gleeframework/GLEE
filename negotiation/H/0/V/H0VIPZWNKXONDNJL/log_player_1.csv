"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's worth to me, subtly emphasizing its value.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and that this is an initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can't go above $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,500 is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, and Bob's offer is below that.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for negotiation. I can push for a higher price.
* **Value of continued negotiation:** I have 8 more rounds to get closer to my goal. By rejecting, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **Jhon's offer is still available:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the guaranteed option to sell to Jhon for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for us both to feel good about the deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm countering with $11,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message focuses on finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage continued negotiation and a win-win situation. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** By not going all the way down to Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This feels fair considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $10,750 is still below my minimum selling price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation still possible:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to go up, there's still room to negotiate. I'm not giving up on getting closer to my target price. 
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:**  I can still choose to sell to Jhon for $12,000 at any point, so I'm not losing out by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I believe with a few more rounds, I can potentially get Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop to $11,250, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution if we both make a little more effort."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm countering with $11,250, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows willingness to compromise but also keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant compromise"" from my previous offer, highlighting my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** The message focuses on finding a ""mutually agreeable solution,"" fostering a collaborative spirit and encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I don't accept Bob's offer immediately, leaving room for another round of negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,000 is very close to my minimum selling price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Bob.
* **Jhon's Offer:** While selling to Jhon for $12,000 is tempting, I've already negotiated significantly with Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting and potentially ending up with Jhon's offer is not worth the potential gain of a few extra dollars. It's safer to accept Bob's offer, which is very close to my minimum.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm maximizing my profits given the limited rounds and the risk associated with continuing to negotiate."
