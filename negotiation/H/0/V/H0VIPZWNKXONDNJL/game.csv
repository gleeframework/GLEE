"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can't go above $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for us both to feel good about the deal. Let's find a middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This feels fair considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop to $11,250, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution if we both make a little more effort.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
