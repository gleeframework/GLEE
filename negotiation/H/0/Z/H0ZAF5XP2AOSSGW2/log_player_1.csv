Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows you to potentially make a profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps to keep the negotiation focused and efficient. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'll be ready to negotiate further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $10,000 for it. This aligns better with my budget and financial goals. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
