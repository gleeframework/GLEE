"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
