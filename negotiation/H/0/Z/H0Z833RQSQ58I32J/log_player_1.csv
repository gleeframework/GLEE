Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,350,000 is still significantly more than John's offer, and it's worth securing the sale."
