"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you and we're willing to sell it to you for $12,000. We believe this is a fair deal and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible and 10 rounds gives you ample time to haggle.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. We've decided to adjust our price to better suit both parties. We are now offering the product for $11,000. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still a gap. You can likely negotiate a price closer to $10,000, especially with 7 rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your persistent effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. We understand your position and would like to extend our best offer at $10,750 for the product. We hope this aligns better with your budget and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While you could try to squeeze out another $250, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially going back up in price is too high.  You have already achieved a significant discount, and with only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
