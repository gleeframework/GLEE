"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would give you a great product at a fair price, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's finalize this and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
