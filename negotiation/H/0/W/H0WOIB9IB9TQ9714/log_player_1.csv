"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer of $6,000 would be a loss. Selling to John for $8,000 is also an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter his offer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $8000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $7200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,200 is still below my minimum price of $8,000. I've already made several counteroffers, and we're not close to a deal. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I'm starting to run out of time. Therefore, it's better to sell the product to John for $8,000, which is a guaranteed price and meets my minimum requirements."
