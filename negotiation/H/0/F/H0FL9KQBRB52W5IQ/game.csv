,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I really think this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
