"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, and you could potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $92? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $92, which is a good compromise.  It's still within your budget of $120 and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product while saving money."
