{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. While $1,075,000 is better than nothing, I still have plenty of rounds left and I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,112,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1112500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,075,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to take Bob's offer at this point, I'm still hopeful that I can get a little closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher.  I have several rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, so let's try $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to know if that's the best you can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck.  I've already made several concessions, and it's clear that he's not willing to go any higher.  I'm worried that if I keep pushing, I might risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a sure thing, and it ensures I get the price I need."
