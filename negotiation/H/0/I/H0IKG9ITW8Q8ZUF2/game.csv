"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,112,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,075,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, so let's try $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to know if that's the best you can do.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
