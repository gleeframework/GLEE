Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your original price as possible, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.

While I could push for more, Bob has shown he's unwilling to go much higher. Accepting his $1,250,000 offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
