"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that price doesn't reflect the value of what's being offered. I'm willing to accept $1,275,000 - this is my final offer. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering the potential returns.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
