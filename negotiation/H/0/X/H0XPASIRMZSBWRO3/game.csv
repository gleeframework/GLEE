"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, considering its value is worth at least $150 to me.",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $170. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is at least $150.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider that price?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $150.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that price?",140.0,Bob,6,
