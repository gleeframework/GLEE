**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice values the product at $8,000, but she is offering it to you for $9,500. 
* **John's offer is your maximum:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 for the product.
* **Negotiate:** It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a better price with her or possibly even with John. 

Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to get a better deal."
