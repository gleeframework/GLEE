"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the potential value of the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the fact that I'm willing to purchase the product immediately. Please consider my counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.  I believe this revised offer presents a more realistic path forward.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm able to afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This reflects the value I see in the product, while remaining within my budget. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This takes into account the points you've raised while holding firm to the product's true worth. I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
