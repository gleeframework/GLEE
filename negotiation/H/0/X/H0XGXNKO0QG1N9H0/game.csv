"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
