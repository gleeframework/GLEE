"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85 is a good one, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $88 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $91. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",91.0,Alice,5,
