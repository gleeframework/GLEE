Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its fair market value is around $15,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $13,500. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 allows for some potential negotiation downward while still ensuring Alice makes a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning a public listing implies others might be interested, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer, but it represents a strong opening move for Alice."
