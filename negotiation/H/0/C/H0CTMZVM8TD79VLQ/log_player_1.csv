Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you're interested in.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($15,000) as possible to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above our minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
