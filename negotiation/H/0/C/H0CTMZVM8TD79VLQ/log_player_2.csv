# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you're interested in.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While it's true you could buy the product from John for $15,000, accepting Alice's offer of $14,000 saves you $1,000 and is still within your budget."
