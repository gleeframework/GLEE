"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for me and is significantly closer to your initial offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
