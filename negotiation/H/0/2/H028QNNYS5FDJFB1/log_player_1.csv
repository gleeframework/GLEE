Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also leaves room for me to potentially increase the price.
* **""Great deal for both of us""**: This phrasing emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation, making the offer more appealing. 
* **""Significantly below its true value""**: This statement subtly reinforces the value of the product while avoiding being overly aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I have the option to sell to John for my desired price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I need to find a price that is acceptable to me while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for me and is significantly closer to your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $800,000:** This is a compromise that meets halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000.
* **""Split the difference"":**  This phrasing implies a fair and mutually beneficial solution. 
* **""Good profit margin"":**  This statement subtly reminds Bob of the value of the product and the potential profit he could make.
* **""Significantly closer to your initial offer"":** This reinforces that I am willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a better price than his initial offer.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll continue to negotiate, but I'll likely need to be more flexible to reach an agreement.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price of $1,200,000."
