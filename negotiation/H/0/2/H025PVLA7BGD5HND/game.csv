"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given the value you place on it. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I could consider $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still below the minimum I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $12,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,5,
