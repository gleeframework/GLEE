"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's in my best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given the value you place on it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I could consider $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still room for compromise and I want to avoid buying from John if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still below the minimum I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $12,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget. While we've made progress, it's clear she's unlikely to go any lower. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000, so I'll buy the product from John for that price."
