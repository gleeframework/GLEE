"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product valued at $1,000,000. I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to accept a price that's almost double what you can get it for elsewhere."
