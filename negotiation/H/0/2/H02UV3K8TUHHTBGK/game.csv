"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This price is closer to your offer and still represents a good value for you considering the product's benefits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still a little above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
