Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for the price:**  By stating that you ""believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its worth,"" you subtly imply that the product might be undervalued even at that price.
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and open to discussion. You're not giving an ultimatum, but inviting Bob to engage in a conversation about the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and potentially securing a deal above your minimum acceptable price."
