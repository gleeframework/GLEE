"Alice, your product looks great but $1200000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $800000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look at other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
