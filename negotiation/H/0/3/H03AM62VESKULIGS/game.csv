"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,000?  That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to work with you, Bob. Considering the value the product can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
