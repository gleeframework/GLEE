Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets a positive tone. It also emphasizes the value of the product, which might encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down further but only to a point where I'm still comfortable with the price. I also have the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a more favorable price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $11,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer and above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation. It also acknowledges Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that undervalues my product.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our current offers. By offering $11,000, I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my interests. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations until we reach an agreement or I decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe that I can still secure a better price than $10,500. By showing willingness to negotiate but not settling for a low price, I'm hoping to push Bob further towards my desired price range. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer of $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $10,750, which is exactly in the middle between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential for a fair compromise. It acknowledges Bob's willingness to increase his offer, showing I'm receptive to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that feels fair to both of us and hopefully ends the negotiation. Offering a price that is the exact midpoint shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John as we're getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
