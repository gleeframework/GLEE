"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm setting a psychological anchor. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Preserving the Option of John:** I haven't revealed John's offer. This gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob increased his offer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to move up from his initial perceived value shows he's interested and open to negotiation. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as leverage, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be fair to the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** I'm making a significant step down from my initial offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While a $200,000 reduction seems large, it keeps me well above both my minimum and Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** My message emphasizes the inherent value of the product, justifying the price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we've both agreed on.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Counteroffer:** Bob has made a substantial jump from his previous offer, indicating a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not yield significantly better results. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob losing interest."
