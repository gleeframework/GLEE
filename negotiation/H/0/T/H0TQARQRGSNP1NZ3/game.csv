"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be fair to the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we've both agreed on.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
