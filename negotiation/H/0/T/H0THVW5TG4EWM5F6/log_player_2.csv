"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $140, and it's her ""final offer.""  You can get the product for $120 from John, saving you $20 and avoiding further negotiation."
