"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product.  I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? It's a high-quality product and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
