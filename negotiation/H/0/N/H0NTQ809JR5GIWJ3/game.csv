"Alice, $120 is too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference again and go with $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
