"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so I'm sure you can see the value in my product. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $925,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  Let's do $937,500. This is my final offer.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit further, so how about $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,6,
