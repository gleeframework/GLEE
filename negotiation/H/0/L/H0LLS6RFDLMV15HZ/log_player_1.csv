Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value, even more than you might initially realize. How about we start the conversation at $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price high in his mind.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""start the conversation"" signals that you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving a good chance of securing a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
