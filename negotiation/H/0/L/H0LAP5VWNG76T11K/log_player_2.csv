"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you great value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs $1,200,000).  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a good starting point, splitting the difference between Alice's offer and my desired price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Reasoning Provided:**  My message explains why I'm counteroffering, focusing on the product's value to me. This helps build rapport and shows I'm thinking strategically. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to pay less, buying the product for $1,150,000 saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal considering the product's value to me and the limited rounds left.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product."
