"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
