"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
