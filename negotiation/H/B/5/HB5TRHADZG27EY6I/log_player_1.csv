Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed backup offer at $1,500,000, Alice wants to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but slightly below John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure that might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
