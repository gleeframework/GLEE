Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:**  It's above your minimum value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Bob is likely to be more receptive to a reasonable starting point.
* **It includes a friendly message:**  Building a good rapport can help keep the negotiation positive.

Remember, the goal is to get the best price possible while still making a sale. Be prepared to negotiate and consider the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value you've set for the product.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to $125.  This product is really valuable, and I think $125 is a fair price that reflects that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $122, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, $122 is close to the midpoint between your last offer and Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still above your minimum value and a good deal considering John is only offering $100. It's time to finalize the sale and move on."
