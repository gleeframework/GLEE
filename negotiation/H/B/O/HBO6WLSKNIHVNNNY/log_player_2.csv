You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $80 rather than risk Alice rejecting further offers and losing out on the deal entirely."
