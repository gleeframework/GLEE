{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a good deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also below your minimum acceptable price, giving you some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's a reasonable compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe there's still room for a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
