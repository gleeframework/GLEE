{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within the realm of possibility. It also opens the door for discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for some room for compromise. Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1050000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my goal, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, selling to him ensures I get the best deal."
