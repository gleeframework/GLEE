Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  It's valuable, and I know it could be a real game-changer for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at or below this price doesn't make sense.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while staying above your minimum acceptable price.

This offer balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
