"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. You can potentially get a better deal from Alice by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's price and my maximum. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. This gives us both a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.  However, I believe there's still potential for a better price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price slightly. This time, I'm going to counter with her previous offer of $1,300,000.  This shows good faith and demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal. I'm hoping she will either accept or counter with a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price. At this point, I'm no longer confident that I can negotiate a better price with Alice.  It's better to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, which is still within my budget.  Further negotiation with Alice could risk a stalemate or an even higher price."
