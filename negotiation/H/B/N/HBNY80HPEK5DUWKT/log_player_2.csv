"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $25,000 is way above his maximum budget of $15,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum limit. He should try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but he should still try to push for a lower price. $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that is still below his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,500 is only slightly above his budget, he's now very close to his limit. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down just a little more. There's a good chance she'll be willing to accept a price closer to his $15,000 limit, especially after several rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

Bob should offer $15,500.  He's reached his maximum budget and should try to get as close as possible to that. There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer as she's already come down a significant amount and is likely motivated to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose option (3) and buy the product from John for $15,000.  Alice is not willing to go lower, and while $16,000 is close, it's still over Bob's maximum budget. John offers the product at Bob's exact limit, making him the better choice."
