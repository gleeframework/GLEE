"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might accept it, but it's also likely he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for this product. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects its true value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's split the difference and go with $1300000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to your desired price and is a good compromise.  You have already rejected his offer twice and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. It's a good deal for you, and you can use the extra $100,000 to potentially reinvest or further your business."
