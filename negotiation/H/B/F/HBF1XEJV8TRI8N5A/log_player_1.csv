Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price but still above my minimum."
