"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and ensures a successful partnership.  Let's continue this conversation and reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
