$500,000 is a great price, but it's too early to accept. I want to see if I can get it even lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price than $500,000."

$400,000 is still a good price, but I'm going to try to get it down even further. I'm not ready to give up yet."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I think we're getting closer to a deal."

Alice is moving closer to my desired price.  $450,000 is a fair price, and I don't want to risk her walking away or me having to buy from John at a much higher price."
