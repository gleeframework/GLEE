"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I believe it's a great value for you given its quality and benefits.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $155? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. ",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $145 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's try $150. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. If you're interested, let's close the deal. ",150.0,Alice,5,
