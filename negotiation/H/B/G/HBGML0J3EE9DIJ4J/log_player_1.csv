Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While $175 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not unreasonable given my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open-Ended Message:**  The message is friendly and leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While I'm open to negotiation, selling for $140 would result in a loss.
* **I have a backup option with John.** This gives me leverage to push for a better price with Bob.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $155? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also  that I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that $155 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still not selling at a loss, which means I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150.** This is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and potentially getting into another round of negotiation.
* **Time is valuable.**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and I'm confident John is a reliable buyer."
