"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $112.50. How about we try $109? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",109.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $109 is just too far off for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $111. Let's get this deal done!",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. How about $108? I'm willing to take a small loss to get a good deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about we meet in the middle at $109.50? I'm willing to compromise to get a good deal.",109.5,Bob,8,
