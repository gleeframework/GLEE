"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome ($120) while still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to maximize my earnings.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to discuss the price, signaling a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Potential:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I want to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my target price. By rejecting this offer, I can send a counteroffer that puts more pressure on him to close the deal.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a quick and safe choice, but it doesn't allow me to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and we can close the deal right now.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm not dropping too much, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him why it's worth a slightly higher price.
* **Urgency:**  I suggest closing the deal now, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Flexibility:** While I'm firm on the price, the message leaves room for a small compromise if needed."
