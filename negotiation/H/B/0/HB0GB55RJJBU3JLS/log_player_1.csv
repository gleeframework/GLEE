Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,500,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  It's still above my minimum price, but it's getting closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made several concessions, and it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement.  At this point, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option.  It guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiations."
