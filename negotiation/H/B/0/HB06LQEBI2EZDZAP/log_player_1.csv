``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still earn a significant profit. I'm also highlighting the product's value to entice Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I have 9 rounds left and selling to John is always an option, so I have leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the discount from my initial offer to encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my goal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 6 rounds left and selling to John is always an option, so I have leverage to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly, showing that I'm still committed to reaching a deal with Bob. I'm also emphasizing the discount and the value of the product to make my offer more appealing. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $1,050,000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 4 rounds left and selling to John is always an option, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product, and it's the best deal you'll find."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to put pressure on Bob.  I have 3 rounds left, and selling to John is always an option, so I still have leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $1,025,000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I only have 2 rounds left.  I'm not sure if I can get him to agree to my desired price in that timeframe.  It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
