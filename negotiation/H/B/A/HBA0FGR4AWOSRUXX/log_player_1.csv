Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it represents a great value at this price point, but I need a quick decision as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows us to potentially secure a sale quicker and avoid potential delays.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** The price is negotiable, but still significantly above Bob's perceived value and comfortably above Alice's minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,500. He might counter-offer, or refuse entirely.  However, this strategy starts the negotiation from a strong position for Alice."
