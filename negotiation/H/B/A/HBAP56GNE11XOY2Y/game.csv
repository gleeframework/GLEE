"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're asking for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge your perspective, I believe $1,400,000 is below the product's true market value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a reasonable balance between our needs. I'm confident this will be a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,550,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
