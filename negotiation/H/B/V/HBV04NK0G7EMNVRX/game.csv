"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you consider $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value while working within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
