Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. It's also a bold opening that might encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if I'm willing to negotiate further or if I'm better off going with John's guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, though a smaller one than I initially hoped for. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but accepting Bob's offer right now provides certainty and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
