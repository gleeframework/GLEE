"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've seen similar products selling for.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
