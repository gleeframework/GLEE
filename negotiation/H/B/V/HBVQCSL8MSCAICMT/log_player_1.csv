"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and encourages him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,150,000, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value. This might encourage Bob to counteroffer again, moving closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob or sell to John. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I am serious about closing a deal with him and am willing to compromise. However, I am still holding firm on my minimum value and am hopeful that Bob will accept this offer."
