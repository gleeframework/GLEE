"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should counter-offer with a lower price, closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $100? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now offering the product at your maximum budget. There's no benefit to rejecting and trying to get it lower, as John is also offering it at $100."
