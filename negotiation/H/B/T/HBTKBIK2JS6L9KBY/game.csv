"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
