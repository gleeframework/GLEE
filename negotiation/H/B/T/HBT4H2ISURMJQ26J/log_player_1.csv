Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also important to note that I can always walk away and sell to John at any time if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for it right away.  I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see how the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility while still leaving some room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price without risking losing the sale."
