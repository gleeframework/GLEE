"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what works for me. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,125,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
