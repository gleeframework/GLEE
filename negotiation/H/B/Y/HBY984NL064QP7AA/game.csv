"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I'd like to hear your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
