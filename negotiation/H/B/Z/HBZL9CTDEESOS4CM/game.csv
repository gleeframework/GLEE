"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't let this go for less than $18,500. It's a truly exceptional product, and I believe that price reflects its value.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $17,000.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll need to explore other options.",17000.0,Bob,4,
