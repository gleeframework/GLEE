Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of  $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product. This offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's inherent value and Alice's willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he's getting a potentially good deal.
* **Safety net:** Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, especially with some negotiation."
