"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $8,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,200 is closer, but still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $8,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
