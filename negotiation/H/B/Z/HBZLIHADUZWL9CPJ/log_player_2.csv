(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

While $105 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95? That's a good middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $80.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $80, it's the most logical choice to take."
