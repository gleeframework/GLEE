Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind a strong offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This is his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept $800,000 from John, making this your ""backup"" price.
* **The Goal:** Maximize profit by getting Bob as close to his $800,000 valuation as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $780,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."", 
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage a quicker decision.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value"" subtly reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is just below Bob's maximum, aiming for the highest likely acceptance while leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Time Limit:**  Adding a deadline creates urgency, making Bob less likely to delay his decision.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. You can adjust the price and message based on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style or any additional information about the product's desirability."
