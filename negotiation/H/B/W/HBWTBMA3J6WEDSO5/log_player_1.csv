"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly and encouraging tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I leave myself room to lower the price if necessary. 
* By offering a high price, I can assess Bob's seriousness about buying the product. If he rejects, I have the option to lower the price or sell to John.
* This strategy maximizes the potential for a good deal, while also leaving the door open to other options if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I'm interested in discussing a price closer to $10,000 if possible. Thank you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **I still have 9 rounds left.** This gives me ample opportunity to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John would be a guaranteed $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer.** However, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $14,000, which is $4,000 higher than Bob's offer but $1,000 lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing a willingness to negotiate. I also subtly highlight the product's value to justify my price.

**Strategy:**

* **Reduce the gap:** I'm narrowing the price difference between my offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain profit:**  $14,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise, which could encourage Bob to reciprocate.

**Next steps:**

I will observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I will continue negotiating, potentially dropping my price slightly in subsequent rounds.  However, I will be prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. I'd like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's closer than his previous offer, accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **I have 6 rounds remaining.** This gives me enough time to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer.** However, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than his current offer, but still within a range where I can make a reasonable profit.  I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $13,000, which is a $1,000 compromise from my previous offer and $1,000 higher than Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and expressing confidence in the value of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to accept. I also subtly emphasize the benefits of a quick deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Continue narrowing the gap:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and signals my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain profit:** $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still in a good position.
* **Time pressure:** I'm subtly hinting at a deadline to encourage Bob to accept, as I have the option to sell to John. 

**Next steps:**

I will observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I will continue negotiating, but I will be more cautious about dropping my price further.  If he continues to offer significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, I will consider selling to John."
