"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a chance she might be willing to accept a lower offer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a fantastic product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $12,500, but that's still a significant amount of money.  You're trying to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to see if Alice is willing to drop the price even further."
