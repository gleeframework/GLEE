Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be beneficial to your company. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob's company, hoping to increase his desire to buy.
* **Fair Deal:** I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, making it seem like a win-win scenario.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potentially higher price. 

This approach allows for a starting point that is beneficial for me while also giving Bob room to negotiate if he wishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This price is still well above your value, and it allows for a comfortable profit margin. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is still above my minimum value, it's significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.  
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, and I want to explore getting closer to my ideal price of $1,400,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I can try to secure a price closer to my initial proposal and potentially maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product's value is significantly higher than that, and I'm confident it will provide you with substantial returns.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for both of us, while acknowledging the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm not dropping too far from my initial price, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I'm highlighting the potential profit margin for both parties, framing it as a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Clear Goal:** I'm making it clear that $1,300,000 is my final compromise, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal."
