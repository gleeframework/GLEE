"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be beneficial to your company. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This price is still well above your value, and it allows for a comfortable profit margin. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product's value is significantly higher than that, and I'm confident it will provide you with substantial returns.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for both of us, while acknowledging the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
