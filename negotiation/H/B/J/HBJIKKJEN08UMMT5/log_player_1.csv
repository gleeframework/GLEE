Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I want to try to get a higher price from Bob.  I'm willing to go down a little, but I'm not going to accept his offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, considering your interest in the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's work towards a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1520000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,520,000 is a good compromise.  It's within my acceptable range and getting closer to a deal.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action at this point."
