"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I can do $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This price is still below the minimum I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,5,
