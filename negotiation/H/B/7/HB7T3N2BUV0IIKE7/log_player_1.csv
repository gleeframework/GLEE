Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,800. Would you be willing to consider this price?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,200 for it. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offers are getting further away from my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to my target without significant concessions on my part. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer at this point."
