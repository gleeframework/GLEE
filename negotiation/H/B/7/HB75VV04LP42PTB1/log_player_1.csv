Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. However, because I value our relationship and believe you'll greatly benefit from it, I'm willing to offer a significant discount. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with the $1,000,000 figure sets a high anchor, making the subsequent discount seem more substantial.
* **Strategic Discount:**  Offering a $100,000 discount is significant and might entice Bob while still securing a profit significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, the message aims to justify the high price while emphasizing the discount's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, allowing Bob to feel he has some negotiating power.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better deal than selling to John."
