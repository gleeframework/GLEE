"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,500. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth trying to get closer to Alice's $10,000 value before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's value as possible while still getting a good deal.  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $1000 compared to buying from John.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer is high.  Accepting the offer is the best option in this situation."
