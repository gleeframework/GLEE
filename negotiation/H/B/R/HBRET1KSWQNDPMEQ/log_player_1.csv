"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm proposing $950,000 as a final price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm not going to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $900,000? This is my final offer, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting too low for me.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $800,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than taking a big loss on this deal."
