"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $13500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $13000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value this product brings to you. How about we do $13200? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's the maximum I can afford. I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me at $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
