"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $11,000 is close to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her. I'll counteroffer and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming low to start. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying below my $10,000 limit. By stating my price outright, I'm showing Alice I'm serious about buying but also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I think there's still a chance to save a little more. If I accept $10,500 now, I'm missing out on that potential savings. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to John's offer and see if Alice bites."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $9,000 is quite a drop. I'm willing to budge a little. How about $9,750? That's a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price while still staying below John's offer. This shows her I'm willing to negotiate but also holding my ground.  By presenting it as a ""serious offer"" and mentioning closing the deal, I'm hoping to nudge her towards acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,750 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about $10,250? This is a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250. It's clear she's aiming for a price above $10,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her refusing and me losing out on the product entirely.  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed saving and the best option at this point."
