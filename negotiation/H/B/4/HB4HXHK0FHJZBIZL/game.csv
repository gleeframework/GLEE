"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped.  How about we split the difference and I offer $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
