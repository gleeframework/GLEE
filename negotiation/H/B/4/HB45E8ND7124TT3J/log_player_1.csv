Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves you with a profit far beyond your minimum desired value ($800,000).  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A price of $950,000 is a good compromise. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** By not starting at your maximum, you leave room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  This price is attractive enough for Bob to seriously consider but also high enough to demonstrate your product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired value of $800,000. Accepting would mean a loss. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This price is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's last offer, showing willingness to negotiate. This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable profit:**  $850,000 is a fair price, allowing for a good profit while remaining attractive to Bob.
* **Encourage compromise:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  This price is still higher than John's offer, making it more beneficial to continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below the $800,000 John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees a secure and acceptable profit without further negotiation."
