Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $9,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
