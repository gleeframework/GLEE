Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,750 is still below my desired price point. How about we settle at $8,900?
