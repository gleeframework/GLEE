{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob plenty of opportunity to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price that's only slightly above his absolute limit of $12,000. This shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and sets a strong starting point for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again raising his offer, but he's still keeping it below Alice's last offer. He's trying to demonstrate a willingness to compromise while remaining within his budget. He's also aware that time is running out, so he's trying to find a solution that works for both of them.  Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal goal while still leaving room for Alice to make a counteroffer if necessary."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get a better deal.  At this point, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from Jhon, guaranteeing he'll get it for his target price."
