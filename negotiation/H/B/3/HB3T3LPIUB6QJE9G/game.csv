"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? That's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can get closer to my target. How about we meet at $12,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about the price, and I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $12,800? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,6,
