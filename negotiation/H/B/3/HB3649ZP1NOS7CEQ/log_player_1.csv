Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $18,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he wants to negotiate, he'll likely be negotiating down from $18,000 rather than starting lower.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to elicit Bob's interest level and potential counter-offer.  His response will give you valuable information for the next stage of the negotiation. 
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob."
