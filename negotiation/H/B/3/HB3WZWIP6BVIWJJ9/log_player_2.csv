"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is the best strategy for Bob in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This sets a clear ceiling for how much Bob should be willing to pay.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can enter into negotiations and potentially secure a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to make a sale. 

This approach allows Bob to maximize his potential savings while still having a safe fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I understand this is a unique product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price you'd be willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action:

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's valuation of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice has stated this is her ""final counteroffer,"" but that doesn't necessarily mean she won't budge.  Bob can try one more counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his target price.
* **Safe alternative:**  Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so he has no pressure to accept a deal that's not in his best interest.

By rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer, Bob keeps the negotiation alive and has the potential to save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time for Bob to take the safe route and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Negotiations stalled:**  Alice has repeatedly claimed her offer is ""final,"" yet she continues to make counteroffers. This suggests she may be unwilling to budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a few more rounds of negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, it's unlikely Bob will get down to his target of $1,000,000. The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential reward.
* **Guaranteed deal:** John's offer is a sure thing. Bob can secure the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations.

Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product he wants at a price that aligns with his valuation, minimizing the risk of losing out on a deal or overpaying."
