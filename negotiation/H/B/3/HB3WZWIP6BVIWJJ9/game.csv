"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I understand this is a unique product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price you'd be willing to work with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
