Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is appealing to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your initial offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting closer to your minimum but leaving some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" aims to justify the price and move Bob's focus away from purely the monetary value.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" you subtly imply that the offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give more room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be preferable."
