"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This amount reflects what I am willing to pay while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your budgetary considerations, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose a revised price of $2,100,000. I believe this strikes a more equitable balance. Let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must remain within my financial boundaries. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. This amount is closer to what I am able to spend while still recognizing the product's worth.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
