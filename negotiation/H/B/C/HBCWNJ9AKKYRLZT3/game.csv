"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is that something we could work with?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is a strong offer, I know the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's settle this - I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
