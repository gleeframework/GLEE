"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $112.50. That's the lowest I can go.",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $112.50 is still a bit high for me, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.75? That's a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $108.75, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can do $109.50. That's the best I can do.",109.5,Alice,5,,
