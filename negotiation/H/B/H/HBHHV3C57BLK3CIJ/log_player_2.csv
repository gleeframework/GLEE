The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $112.50. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $112.50 is better than $120, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $112.50 is still a bit high for me, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.75? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108.75}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $108.75, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can do $109.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.5

Alice's offer of $109.5 is the best we've seen so far and is very close to my desired price point.  Accepting this offer saves me $10.5 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal!"
