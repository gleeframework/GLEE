"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is still a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still allows me to make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price."
