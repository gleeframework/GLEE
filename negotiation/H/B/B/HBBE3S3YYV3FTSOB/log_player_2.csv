"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can save $300,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John guarantees you the product, it's the most expensive option.  Negotiating with Alice is a better strategy to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $900,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for Alice to compromise while still ensuring you save a substantial amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. It's likely that she's already nearing her minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer secures the product at a price you can afford and saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer."
