"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value I think you'll get from this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",14000.0,Alice,5,
