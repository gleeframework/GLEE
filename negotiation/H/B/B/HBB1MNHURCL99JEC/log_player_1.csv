Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $100,  starting with an offer slightly below your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Appearing reasonable:** Offering a price of $130 makes it seem like you're already giving a significant discount, which might make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough for him to accept."
