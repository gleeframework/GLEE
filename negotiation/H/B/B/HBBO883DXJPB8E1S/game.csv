"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $125. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go beyond $105. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $115 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to offer $110 for it. This would allow us to both walk away happy with the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $112.50. This is my final concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,
