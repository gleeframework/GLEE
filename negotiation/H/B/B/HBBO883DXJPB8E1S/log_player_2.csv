Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $125. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, or I can buy from John for $100.  I'll reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $115 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to offer $110 for it. This would allow us to both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $112.50. This is my final concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is still above my budget of $100.  I've already negotiated for several rounds, and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down further.  To avoid risking further negotiation rounds and potentially losing the chance to buy from John, I'm going to choose to buy from John for $100."
