Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm happy to extend this offer to you before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This information is powerful in setting your initial offer.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. While it's significantly higher than his valuation, it gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't sell below your minimum price ($15,000). This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $19,000 price, even if it's above his perceived value. This would yield a higher profit than selling to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiating style or if he's aware of your deal with John. 
* Be prepared to potentially negotiate the price down slightly if Bob pushes back. However, don't go below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
