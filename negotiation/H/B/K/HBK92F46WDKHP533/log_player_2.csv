# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product from John for $8,000, so anything higher is a bad deal.  Since Bob is trying to save money, he should reject and try to get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
