,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! The product looks great, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you be open to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $82.50 earlier. I'm willing to meet you at $75, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",75.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $72? That's a fair price for both of us.",72.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $72. I'm willing to meet you at $74, but that's as low as I can go. I think the product is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",74.0,Alice,7,
