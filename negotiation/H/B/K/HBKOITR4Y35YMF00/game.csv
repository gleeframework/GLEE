"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that I think is fair. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  I believe that would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a sense that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the original price. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firming up your price, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,150,000 is pushing my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,000,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
