Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firming up your price, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,150,000 is pushing my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,000,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.  Let me know if that works for you.
