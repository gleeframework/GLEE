"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that this is an initial proposal and I'm willing to discuss the price. This encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than walk away immediately.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits for his business. This helps justify the high price and keeps the focus on the product's value. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I secure a price well above my minimum.
* **Gain information:** Bob's reaction and counter-offer (if any) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay.

Remember, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate its value, I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for it. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,500,000 is still below what I'm looking for. Would you consider $1,550,000?  I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a relatively small concession from my initial offer ($50,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm not dropping to Bob's price immediately, as I believe the product is worth more.  This maintains a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob why the product warrants a higher price. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain momentum:** By staying engaged and making reasonable counteroffers, I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,525,000. This brings us closer together and allows me to move forward with confidence. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is a reasonable compromise and provides a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While I might be able to push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns of further negotiation make this a strong offer to accept."
