Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to my minimum desired price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price of $145, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum desired price of $150. I believe this is a fair compromise and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum desired price of $150.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $150, which is a better deal for me."
