"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a substantial amount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a significant discount from the value I place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to $900000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $975000? This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both walk away happy with the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
