"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
