# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000 for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly, but Bob is still within his budget to buy from John for $1,000,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer when he can get the product for a lower price from John.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm really close to securing the product elsewhere for $1,000,000, so I'm going to have to pass on your current offer. If you are willing to drop the price to my target of $1,000,000, I'm happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to securing the product elsewhere, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which is $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,025,000, but Bob can still get the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth it to Bob to go with John and save $25,000.  While Alice might come down further, it's not worth the risk to Bob of continuing negotiations.  He can get a better deal from John right now."
