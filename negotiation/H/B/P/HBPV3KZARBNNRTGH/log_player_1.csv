"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product's value to me is not as high as you do, and I'd like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me, given the product's worth to Bob. I still have time to negotiate and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Consider the value you'll get from this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to find a better balance. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about we try $1,225,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price this low. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, hoping to reach a compromise before we reach the point where selling to John becomes the more appealing option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we settle on $1,240,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to move forward with this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1240000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.  I'm not willing to settle for $1,220,000, which is significantly lower than my desired price point. To avoid losing any more time and ensure I get at least something for the product, I will sell it to John for $1,000,000."
