Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible strategy for Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value might give the impression of a deal while still leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to.
* **Time Value & Opportunity Cost:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, selling quickly to Bob might be preferable even at a slightly lower price than trying to negotiate with John later. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. He might try to negotiate lower, or he might be unwilling to engage at all. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob's offer doesn't meet her minimum acceptable price."
