"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,500.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There is a chance Alice will be willing to come down closer to her value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to Alice's value while still leaving room for a potential compromise.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might incentivize her to accept, but it's still within Bob's budget."
