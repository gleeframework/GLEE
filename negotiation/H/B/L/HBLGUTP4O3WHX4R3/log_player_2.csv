(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. There's no point in accepting her offer or buying from John yet, as you have rounds left to see if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my limit and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  If she rejects this, I'll know I need to move on to John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's closer. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I still have more rounds available, so there's no need to buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $12,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better price than Alice's current offer. It's a middle ground that might be appealing to her.  If she rejects this, I'll reconsider buying from John in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating. I have more rounds available, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $13,000. This is still within my budget, and it shows I'm serious about getting a deal. It's a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current offer. If she rejects this, I'll seriously consider buying from John in the next round, as I only have a few rounds left."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to take a risk and keep negotiating. With only three rounds left, I'll need to decide if I'm going to buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $14,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still within my budget and closer to Alice's last offer. With only two rounds left, I need to signal that I'm nearing my limit but still willing to negotiate. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but with only one round left, the risk of Alice rejecting my final counteroffer is too high. At this price point, buying from John is the more sensible choice. I've saved a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely."
