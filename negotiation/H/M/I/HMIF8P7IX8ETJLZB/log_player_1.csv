Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauge Interest:**  By offering it at $180, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts, great! If he rejects or counter-offers, we know there's room to negotiate down to our minimum of $150.
* **Backup Option:** We have the security of John as a buyer at $150, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
