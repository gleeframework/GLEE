Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get something for the product, $75 is below my minimum.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just a little too low for me.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
