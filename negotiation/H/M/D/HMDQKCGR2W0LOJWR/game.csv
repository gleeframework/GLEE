"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its value. I understand this is a significant investment, so please consider it carefully. I'm open to discussing the price further and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
