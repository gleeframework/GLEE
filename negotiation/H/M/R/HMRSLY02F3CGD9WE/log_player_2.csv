"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($18,000) compared to your maximum budget ($12,000). It's in your best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you haven't explored Alice's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, you should start by offering the lowest possible price you're willing to pay. This makes it clear that you're serious about negotiating a fair deal. It's possible Alice will reject this offer, but it's a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above your budget.  While it's getting closer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and you're already aware that you can always get the product for $12,000 from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

You've already shown Alice your absolute bottom line ($12,000). Now, you need to find a middle ground. Offering $14,000 represents a significant compromise from Alice's previous offer of $16,000. This price is still within your budget, and it shows Alice you're serious about a deal while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  While she's clearly coming down in price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and further negotiation could take time and energy. It's more efficient at this point to buy from John, who is offering the product at your desired price.  You've already explored the negotiation with Alice and know her limits."
