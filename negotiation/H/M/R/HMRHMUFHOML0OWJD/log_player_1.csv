I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves a substantial amount of profit for Bob.  This offer should incentivize him to buy, while still leaving room for potential negotiation if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, as it's still a good deal for both of us."

Bob has now matched my counteroffer.  I'm happy to accept this price as it's significantly higher than selling to John."
