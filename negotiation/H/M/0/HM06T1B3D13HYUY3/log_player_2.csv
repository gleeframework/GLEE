"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's offer, there's no benefit in rejecting Alice's offer.  Accepting it means you're buying the product for the same price, but you don't need to go through the hassle of finding John."
