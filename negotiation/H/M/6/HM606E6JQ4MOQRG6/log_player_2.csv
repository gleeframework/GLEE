"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a fantastic product at a price lower than its true value, and I get a fair price for something that's important to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
