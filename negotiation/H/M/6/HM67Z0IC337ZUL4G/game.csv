"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $16,000 is still too high for me. How about $14,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",14000.0,Bob,4,
