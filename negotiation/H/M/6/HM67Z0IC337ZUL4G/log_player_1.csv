Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $16,000 is still too high for me. How about $14,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.
