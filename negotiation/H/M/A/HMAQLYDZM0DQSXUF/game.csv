"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I respect your valuation of the product. However, I believe we can still find common ground. I am willing to pay $925,000 for your product.
