"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I can offer you $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting stuck. To be honest, your latest offer doesn't move us closer to a deal. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're open to it.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another move. However, I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I can offer you $1,200,000, which is my final concession. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
