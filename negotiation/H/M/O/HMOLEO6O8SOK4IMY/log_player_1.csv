Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Balancing Act:** I want to maximize my profit but also keep Bob engaged. A very high initial price might scare him off.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to negotiate, but I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to reject Bob's counteroffer and continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm willing to stand my ground and demonstrate the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:** I'm holding firm to my initial goal of getting as close to $1,000,000 as possible, but I'm also showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to a quicker agreement.  It shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:** $950,000 is still a good deal for me, significantly higher than Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about we meet at $920,000? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** $920,000 is very close to my target of $950,000, and only a little less than my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to squeeze out another $30,000, there's a chance Bob will walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the potential of getting nothing.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. It's more beneficial to accept the offer and move on."
