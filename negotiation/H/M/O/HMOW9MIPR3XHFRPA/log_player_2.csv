# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $9,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,250 is closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again."
