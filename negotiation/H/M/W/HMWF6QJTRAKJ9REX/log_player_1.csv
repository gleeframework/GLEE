Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  She should start by aiming significantly higher to see if Bob will bite.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer gives Alice room to negotiate down if Bob balks at the price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have detailed information about Bob's budget or typical purchasing behavior.  More market research could inform a more precise offer.
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term business relationship with Bob, she might adjust her starting price to be less aggressive."
