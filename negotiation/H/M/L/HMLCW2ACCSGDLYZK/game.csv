"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the value you'll get from the product. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $950,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. It's a fair price that ensures a profitable deal for both of us. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
