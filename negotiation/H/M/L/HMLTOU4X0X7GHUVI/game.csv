"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in exploring a price closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. To make progress, I'm willing to offer $9500. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to find a mutually beneficial solution.  What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,10000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above the value you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. To close this deal, I'm willing to offer $9750. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,9800.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9800. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $9700. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What are your thoughts?",9700.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,9900.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to meet you at $9900, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",9900.0,Alice,9,,
