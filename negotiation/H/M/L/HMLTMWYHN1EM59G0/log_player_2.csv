Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $100 to you, and she's asking for $150. You can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than before, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  You can get a better deal by either counter-offering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I can pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I've already come down from $150 to $130, and now I'm willing to go to $125. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice is not willing to budge much further, and her offer of $125 is still above what you're willing to pay. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
