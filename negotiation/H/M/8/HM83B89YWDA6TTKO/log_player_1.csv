Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a backup offer, you can aim a bit higher.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** 
    * It acknowledges the value for Bob.
    * It positions the price as fair, not just a number.
    * It creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 

* **The Price:**
    * It's significantly below Bob's valuation, making it appealing.
    * It gives you a $150,000 profit margin above your minimum.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust slightly, but remember your bottom line. You always have John's offer to fall back on."
