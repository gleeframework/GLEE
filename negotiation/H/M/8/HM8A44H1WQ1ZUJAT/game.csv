"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've outlined. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $1,080,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. ",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,095,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
