"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is only $100. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $155? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $150, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $155, Bob. I think we've been negotiating long enough. If you're really interested in the product, $155 is the lowest I can go. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,7,
