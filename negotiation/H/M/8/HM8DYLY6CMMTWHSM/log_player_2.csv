"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's true worth is $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say? Will you accept my offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is less than the $1,000,000 you are willing to pay. This is a good deal for you, as you can save $50,000. Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse deal."
