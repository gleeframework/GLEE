Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting the potential I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob is willing to go higher. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,425,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While I believe the product is worth more, Bob seems firm on his $1,300,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
