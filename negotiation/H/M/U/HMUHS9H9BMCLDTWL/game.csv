"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which still leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move a bit closer, but $9,500 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be willing to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
