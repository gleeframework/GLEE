"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone can build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (value to Bob) can make it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is far below my acceptable range. 
* **There are still rounds left:** I can continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which still leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating willingness to compromise. 
* **Compromise:** The price is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is increasing his offer, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 6 rounds left, time is running out.
* **John is a good option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe and lucrative alternative. 

I'm willing to risk further negotiation, but I need to be strategic.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round. If Bob doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move a bit closer, but $9,500 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm presenting the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the potential for a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

I'm still not at my ideal price, but this offer balances the risk of losing the deal with the possibility of getting closer to my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum.  
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum requirement of $15,000.

It's not ideal to have to sell to John, but given the limited time and the stalled negotiations with Bob, it's the most sensible option to maximize my earnings."
