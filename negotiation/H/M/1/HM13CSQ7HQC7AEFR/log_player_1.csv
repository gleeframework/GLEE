"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels more reasonable to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and Bob is offering only $1,100,000. It's not worth selling at that price. I will try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's fair for me as well."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're moving closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  John is a safe option at $1,200,000, but I believe I can get more from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,225,000?  This is a fair compromise that still gives you a significant discount from your initial assessment."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You're right, we're getting close. To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a very fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum price.  While I would love to get more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to Bob at this price ensures a quick and safe transaction."
