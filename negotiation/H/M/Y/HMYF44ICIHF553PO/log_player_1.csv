"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it's a compromise that keeps the negotiations moving forward.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,850,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still confident I can get a higher price than John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will realize this is a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed offer from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
