Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We start by aiming slightly below the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This increases the chances of a sale and a higher profit margin than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Clear and Direct Communication:**  The message is concise and clearly states the price and your belief in the product's value."
