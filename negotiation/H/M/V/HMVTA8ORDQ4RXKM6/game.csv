"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",75.0,Alice,3,
