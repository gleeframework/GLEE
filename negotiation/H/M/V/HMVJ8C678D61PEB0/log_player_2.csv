"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum price point of $120. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$95 is still within my budget and a good deal, especially given I'm already on round 3.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and moving on."
