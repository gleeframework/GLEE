"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'd be happy to explore other options, including selling to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
