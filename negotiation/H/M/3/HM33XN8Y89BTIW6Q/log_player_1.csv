Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price, considering the market value and my own limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:

I'm prepared to increase my offer to $950,000, reflecting a significant compromise on my part.  This price is reasonable given its potential benefits and aligns with my budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Bob's offer:

I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product, a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise given the product's value and my financial limitations. I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial and allows us to close this deal.

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his current offer. Accepting $1,100,000 is a $400,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
