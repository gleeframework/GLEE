{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product worth that price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $130? It's closer to your offer, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 below my minimum, and it seems like we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's better than my minimum and  still a good deal for me."
