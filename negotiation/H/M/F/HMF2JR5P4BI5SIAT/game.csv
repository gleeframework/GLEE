"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $10000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,,
