"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll sell it to you for $8,200. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
