"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept the offer at $15,000. There's no information on the actual value of the product to Alice, and there's a chance she might be willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a lower price point. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my target price and is a good deal considering the option of buying from John at $15,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product and save money. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
