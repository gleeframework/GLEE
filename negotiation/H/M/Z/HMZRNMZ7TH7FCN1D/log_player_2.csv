"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer and within my budget.  While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 more than John's price.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation with Alice won't yield a significant price drop, and the risk of her rejecting my next counteroffer is high.  It's more efficient to accept her offer and secure the product."
