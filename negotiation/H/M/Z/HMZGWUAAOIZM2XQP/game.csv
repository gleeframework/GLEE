"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous conversations, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. I believe this price is still a good compromise and reflects the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
