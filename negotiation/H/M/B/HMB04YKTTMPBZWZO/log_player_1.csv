Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's worth considering. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:**  This price is a significant markup from your minimum value of $1,200,000. It leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a substantial profit.
* **Message:** The message highlights the product's value and potential while leaving room for Bob to ask for more information. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is a balancing act:

* **Maximize Profit:** You aim for a higher price than your minimum value, increasing your potential earnings.
* **Avoid Rejection:**  You avoid setting an unreasonably high price that would likely result in Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message and price leave space for negotiation if Bob expresses interest but wants a lower price. 

By offering a fair but ambitious price and providing a positive message, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still positioning yourself to earn more than your minimum value."
