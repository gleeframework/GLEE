"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a fair offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,4,
