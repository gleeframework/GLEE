"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's limit of $80. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  There's a chance he can get closer to his target price with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $80.  It's the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
