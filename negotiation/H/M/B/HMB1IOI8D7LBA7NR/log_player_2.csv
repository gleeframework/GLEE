"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, it's not a good deal. It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and hopefully leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in selling the product for this price, as it's still above her minimum price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $13,500. It's still within my budget and hopefully a more appealing price for Alice, as it's closer to her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for me. At this point, it's becoming clear that negotiating with Alice might be a long process and I'm not sure if we'll reach an agreement. I'm happy to buy the product from John for $12,000, which is within my budget and the best price I can secure right now."
