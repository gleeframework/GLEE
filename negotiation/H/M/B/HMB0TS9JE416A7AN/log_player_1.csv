Bob's offer:

Round 4

We are still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

While we'd like to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob is incrementally increasing his offer and we are getting into the later rounds. Accepting at $1,225,000 locks in a good profit above our fallback option of John. It's better to take this guaranteed win than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
