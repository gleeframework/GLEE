While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $925,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a substantial profit over my minimum ($925,000 vs. $1,200,000).
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might make Bob walk away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I can re-invest the money sooner. 

Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
