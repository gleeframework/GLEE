,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for sending over your initial offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? I'm trying to be realistic about what I can afford.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be realistic, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I'm still open to negotiating.",11500.0,Alice,5,
