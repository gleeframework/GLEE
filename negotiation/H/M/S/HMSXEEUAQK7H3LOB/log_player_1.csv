Round 2

While $9,500 is better than the $8,000 from John, I can still do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point through further negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
