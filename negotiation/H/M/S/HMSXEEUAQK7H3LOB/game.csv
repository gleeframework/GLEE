"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that, and it's significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it still gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, and I'm willing to make a deal today. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I need to know if this is the final price. Can we make it happen at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
