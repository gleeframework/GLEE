Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to earn as much as possible, so she starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is ambitious, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer.  Even if Bob negotiates down a little, Alice will still earn more than selling to John.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit, as dealing with John might take more time.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. It's a starting point for negotiation."
