Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the ""good deal"" to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $12,000, I have space to lower the price if Bob counteroffers without going below my minimum. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $8,000, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
