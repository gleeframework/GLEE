"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
