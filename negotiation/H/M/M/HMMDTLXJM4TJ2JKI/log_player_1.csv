Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000).**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but also makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and your own evaluation of the situation.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it saves me some money.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. However, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counter with a higher price:** You can try to push for a price closer to your initial $14,000 offer.
* **See if Bob is willing to go higher:** If he's really interested, he might be willing to increase his offer.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** This shows Bob that you're serious about getting a good price. 

Selling to John now would mean a lower profit for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and we can get this done quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that shows you're willing to compromise.  It's also a fair offer, as it's halfway between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,500). 
* **Emphasis on a ""good deal"":**  You're framing the offer as beneficial for both of you, making it more appealing.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""get this done quickly"" subtly implies that you're willing to walk away if the negotiation drags on.  

By counter-offering with this price, you're showing Bob that you're serious about getting a good deal, but you're also open to reaching an agreement."
