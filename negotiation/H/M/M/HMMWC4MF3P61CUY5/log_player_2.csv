"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. It's best to see if he can negotiate a better price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial offer, $10,500 is still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if they can find a price that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay under $9,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $9,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice is unwilling to drop below $9,750, which is still above Bob's budget. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it is more financially beneficial for Bob to buy from John."
