"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is above Bob's budget. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given the market value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's worth rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further.  There is still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about my bottom line. To make this work, I can't go any lower than $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
