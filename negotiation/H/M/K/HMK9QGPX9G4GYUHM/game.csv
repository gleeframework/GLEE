"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way over my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's the absolute maximum I can afford.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let me see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Alice,7,
