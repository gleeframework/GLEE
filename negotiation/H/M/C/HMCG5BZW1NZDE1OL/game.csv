"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is quite a bit below my minimum. Could you meet me at $11,500? I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, so I'd like to offer $10,750. Can we do that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
