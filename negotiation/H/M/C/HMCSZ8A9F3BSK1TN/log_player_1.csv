Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 if Bob declines. 

Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a strong incentive to buy (saving $40 from a potential future purchase) while still securing a significant profit for you."
