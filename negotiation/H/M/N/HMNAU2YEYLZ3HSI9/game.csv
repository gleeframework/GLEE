"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, recognizing your interest in the product.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1400000 is still too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and a fair price for the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
