"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if he can get a better price from Alice. He's in a strong position knowing he can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a much lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it's justified by the fact that Bob has a fallback option with John for $1,000,000. This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate aggressively and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $850,000 and closer to Bob's counteroffer of $700,000.  This price is also well below the $1,000,000 he could pay John. Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and securing the product.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and Bob having to pay John $1,000,000 outweighs the potential small savings."
