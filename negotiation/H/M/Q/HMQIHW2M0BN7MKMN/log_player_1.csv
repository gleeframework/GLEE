Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and direct. I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, subtly encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:** This is a starting point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option at a much higher price. This gives me leverage and allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay a much higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiation:** I can try to push Bob higher with a counteroffer, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The knowledge of John's offer gives me a strong bargaining position.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the benefits this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects its worth while still allowing you a good return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is a compromise between Bob's initial offer and my desired price. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value the product holds for him. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by highlighting the potential return on investment. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer represents a significant concession, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. This helps maintain my leverage and shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John. Considering that:

* **John is a guaranteed buyer:** There's no risk of further negotiation or rejection with John.
* **The difference is substantial:**  The $550,000 difference is a significant amount of money.

It's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John and secure the higher price. The potential for a slightly better price from Bob is not worth the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of a lower final price."
