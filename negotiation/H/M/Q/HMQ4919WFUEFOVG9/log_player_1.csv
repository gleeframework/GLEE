Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit vs. Risk:** While I could aim for a higher price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, that increases the risk of him rejecting the offer. 
* **Knowing the Bottom Line:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, so any offer to Bob needs to be significantly higher to be worthwhile.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  $925,000 provides a substantial profit margin over John's offer while still being appealing to Bob, as it saves him $75,000 compared to his perceived value.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
