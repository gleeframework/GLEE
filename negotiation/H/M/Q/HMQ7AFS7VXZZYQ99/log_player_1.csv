Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to sell it to Bob for even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" if he recognizes its potential value.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob a ""special deal,"" I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially persuading him to buy before he can fully evaluate other options.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
