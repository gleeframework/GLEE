,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for such a great product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, so how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $107.50 is still a little lower than I'd like.  How about we meet at $112.50?  It's a small step closer to my price, but I'm willing to make it for a quick and easy deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I'll have to look elsewhere for a better deal. I was really interested in this product, but I'm not willing to pay more than $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,6,
