"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This price reflects not only its market value but also the significant benefits it will bring to you. Please let me know if this offer meets your considerations or if you need more information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* However, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer. 
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. 

By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially make a better offer closer to her known value of $8,000."
