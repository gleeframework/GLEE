"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $175. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $160. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $170. It's a good price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",170.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $170. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165?",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $167, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",167.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with $167. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $165 and $167, which is $166. Would you be willing to consider that?",166.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to budge from $167. It's the lowest I'm willing to sell it for. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",167.0,Alice,9,
