Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a significant offer, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
