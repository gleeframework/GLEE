"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a significant offer, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
