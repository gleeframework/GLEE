Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us.
