Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this amazing product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, $1,100,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue haggling and potentially get an even better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm offering it to you for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, coming down to $1,080,000. While it's not your ideal price, it's still a substantial saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  Furthermore, Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without risking a stalemate or needing to buy from John at a much higher cost."
