"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to getting this deal done. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.  Let's come to an agreement and close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
