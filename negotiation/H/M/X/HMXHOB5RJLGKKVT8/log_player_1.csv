Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $12,000, given its potential value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could ask for the full $15,000, starting with a slightly lower offer of $12,000 increases the likelihood of acceptance. This price still provides a significant profit margin above our minimum ($8,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite a counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation towards an even higher price. 

By aiming high but remaining reasonable, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price that far exceeds her backup option (John's offer)."
