"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price, above the $1,000,000 minimum I need, to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence and Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to make him see it as a good investment.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation but have a fallback with John, so I'm not desperate for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum requirement, but it's closer than my initial offer. I believe there's room for a more favorable price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob I'm not desperate and allows me to counter-offer in the next round.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I want to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum requirement, so it's a good starting point for this counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""great price"" for Bob, highlighting the benefits of the deal.
* **Openness:** I use ""Let me know what you think,"" inviting further negotiation, while maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, how about $1,000,000 as a compromise? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer is now at my minimum requirement of $1,000,000.
* **Time is Money:**  We're already four rounds in, and I don't want to risk losing a deal and starting over with another buyer.
* **Equal Value:** This price ensures I get the minimum I need, and Bob is getting a good deal within his budget.  
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:** There's no guarantee that I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next round.

Since I'm comfortable with the $1,000,000 offer, accepting it is the most sensible choice."
