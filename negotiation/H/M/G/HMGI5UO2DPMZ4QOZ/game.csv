"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
