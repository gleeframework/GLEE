"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. It looks nice, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, like $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit out of my budget. Could you do $95? That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
