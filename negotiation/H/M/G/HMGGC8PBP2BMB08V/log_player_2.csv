Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit out of my budget. Could you do $95? That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice has come down on her price, she's unlikely to go below $100.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
