"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  $13,000 is still above the product's worth to Alice ($10,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than what he'd pay John ($15,000) and still leaves some room for Alice to profit.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
