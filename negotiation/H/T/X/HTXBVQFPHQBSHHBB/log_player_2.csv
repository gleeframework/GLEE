Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about $750,000?  It's still a fantastic price for a product worth so much to you.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and her offer of $700,000 is a good deal compared to John's $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome, and could risk losing the deal altogether."
