"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be very valuable to me at $600,000.  Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about $750,000?  It's still a fantastic price for a product worth so much to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the range of $650,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $700,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  This product is truly unique, and I believe you'll find its value is worth every penny.",700000.0,Alice,5,
