"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a great product, but I have some budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $700,000, as it's below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a great product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also considering selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm  open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price that respects your budget and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$825,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll make one more counteroffer, but I'm seriously considering selling to John if this doesn't work."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm feeling the pressure of time here.  I'm willing to drop my price to $840,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 840000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached my limit with Bob.  While $800,000 is tempting, it's not worth risking another round with him.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell to him for $1,000,000."
