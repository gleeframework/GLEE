"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested,  $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. To be honest, I'm considering a similar product from another seller for $100. If you're able to come closer to that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, so I'd be willing to do $95 as my absolute final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with the other option.",95.0,Bob,6,
