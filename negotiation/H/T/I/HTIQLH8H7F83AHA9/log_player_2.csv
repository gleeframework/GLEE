# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We are offering the product at a special introductory price of $900,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let us know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate your own counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of your product, $900,000 is above my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, we propose a price of $850,000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit margin while being more accessible to your budget. We look forward to your consideration of this offer.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'm still within the negotiation window and can continue to try and drive the price down.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a solid return on your investment. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
