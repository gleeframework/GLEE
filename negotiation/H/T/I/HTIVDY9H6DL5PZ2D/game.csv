"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that's more reasonable.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a better deal than my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,500?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,000, my absolute top limit. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
