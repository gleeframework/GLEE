{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than $150.  Since John is willing to buy for my minimum, I'll sell to him to guarantee my desired profit."
