"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming the product is worth $1,500,000 to you when you know your upper limit is $1,500,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high.  
* While you could buy from John for $1,500,000, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000."
