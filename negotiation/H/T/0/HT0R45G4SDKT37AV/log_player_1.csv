Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $130. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Since Bob values the product at $150, offering it at $130 leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal even if he doesn't negotiate you down further.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring you make a good profit if Bob accepts. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is above your absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price and closer to your bottom line. There's room for negotiation.  You'll reject this offer to signal that you're aiming for a higher price and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Still Profitable:** This price point still leaves you with a $20 profit margin, which is a good outcome. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down from your initial price. By counter-offering with a smaller decrease, you're testing his willingness to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. I could do $110, but that's really pushing my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $110 is a reasonable profit margin ($10 above your minimum) and a good compromise. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Further negotiation might push Bob away, risking the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While you could hold out for $120, your time and effort might be better spent elsewhere. Accepting a good offer now allows you to move on to other potential deals."
