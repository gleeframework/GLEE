Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll give you a small concession and offer it to you for $100. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $95. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll give you a final concession and offer it to you for $98. That's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $98 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my offer of $95. I really hope we can reach an agreement, but if not, I'll have to move on.",95.0,Bob,8,
