"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's even closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  It seems we're getting closer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,275,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's intrinsic value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'd like to propose an additional concession of $12,500 off the list price. How about $1,237,500?",1237500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I respect your approach.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,262,500?  This represents my final offer.",1262500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
