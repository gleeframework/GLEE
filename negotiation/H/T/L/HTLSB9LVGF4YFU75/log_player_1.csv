Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's even closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'd like to propose an additional concession of $12,500 off the list price. How about $1,237,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,237,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above his initial offer.  He's clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Holding firm for a few more rounds might bring the price closer to $1,250,000 or higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now held firm at $1,250,000 for two rounds and stated it's his final offer.  While there's a chance he might budge a little more, it's risky to continue pushing. Accepting his offer guarantees a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
