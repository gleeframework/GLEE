"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better by making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to get a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:** $11,000 is only $500 more than Bob's ideal price of $10,500.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing her price or Bob being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation.

Overall, accepting the offer at $11,000 is the most prudent decision for Bob, considering his goal of saving money and his maximum budget."
