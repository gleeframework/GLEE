"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,200,000 - $50,000 = $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,150,000 - $25,000 = $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
