Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,200,000 - $50,000 = $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,150,000 - $25,000 = $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you could potentially continue negotiating, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  At $1,125,000, you're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise that allows you to acquire the product without risking losing it to another seller."
