Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but also leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see value in my product at this price, as it's still below what it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and  his counteroffer is closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than selling to John for $80. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
