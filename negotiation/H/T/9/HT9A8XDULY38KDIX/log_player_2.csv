"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate and Bob can potentially get the product for closer to his target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $110 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being a price Alice might consider given her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price, she is still above it. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and there are still several rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price, potentially getting closer to his goal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and has shown that he's not willing to accept Alice's initial price.  Offering $115 is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's previous offer, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It keeps the negotiation moving towards a deal while still leaving room for further concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's target. There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price. By rejecting this offer, Bob shows his determination to get the best possible deal and keeps the pressure on Alice.  He's still better off not accepting the offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and has demonstrated that he's not willing to accept a price above $120.  He's willing to meet Alice halfway, but he won't go higher. This offer is a significant compromise and demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a deal. It's also a price that Alice might consider, as it is closer to her valuation of the product. If she rejects this, there are only 4 rounds left, making the pressure on her to accept a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. There are only 3 rounds remaining, so Bob needs to be strategic.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price, potentially getting Bob closer to his goal. There's a chance that Alice will make a more attractive offer in the next round to close the deal, given the limited rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $100 but needs to be strategic with only two rounds remaining.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  It shows Bob is willing to negotiate while also pressuring Alice to make a final concession. With only one round remaining, Alice might be more inclined to accept this offer to avoid risking losing the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal. Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's target, and there is only one round left.  While there's a chance Alice could accept a counteroffer, the risk is too high. With only one round left, Bob is unlikely to get the product for a price he considers a good deal.  It's better to secure the product from John for $150, which is within his acceptable range.  While it's not ideal, it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
