"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my research, I believe a price of $850,000 is a fair starting point.  This reflects the product's value to me while also allowing for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This price takes into account the unique benefits and potential this product offers.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still well above my budget. To make this work, I'm offering $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to what I believe this product is worth to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
