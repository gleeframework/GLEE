Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100, but let me know if you're interested and we can discuss."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum price.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest. If he's put off by the price, he'll likely counter-offer. If he's very interested, he might accept immediately, giving you the best possible outcome. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 gives Alice a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice is guaranteed to make at least $80."
