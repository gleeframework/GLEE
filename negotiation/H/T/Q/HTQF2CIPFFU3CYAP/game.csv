"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I can't go lower than $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. ",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can we discuss further?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm feeling flexible, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
