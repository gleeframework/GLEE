"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll aim for a compromise that leaves both of us with a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I can't go lower than $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll aim for a compromise that leaves both of us with a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm feeling flexible, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made several concessions, and I don't believe I can get a better deal with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

It's time to secure the best possible outcome.  I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I'm getting a good deal."
