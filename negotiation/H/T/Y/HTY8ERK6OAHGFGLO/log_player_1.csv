Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount from John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we'll need to decide whether to accept, counter again, or stick to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, we might adjust the price slightly lower, even if it means slightly less profit."
