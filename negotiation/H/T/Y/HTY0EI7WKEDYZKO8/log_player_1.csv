Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than the product's value to me ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It's important to build rapport and keep the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price than my minimum.
* **Confidence:** Showing confidence in my offer can influence Bob's decision.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message clearly signals that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'm not willing to sell yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

**Strategy:**

* **Holding Out:** I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still allows for some room for compromise.
* **Staying Flexible:** I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $12,750, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal and emphasize my willingness to compromise. I also highlight the value of the product to justify my offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair price based on the product's value.
* **Negotiation:** My message keeps the door open for further discussion.

By using this strategy, I'm aiming for a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my desired price and also allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference at $12,250? That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation:**  Although I could try to counteroffer and potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and I might end up selling to John at the lower price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While not my ideal price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it and secure a sale.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale altogether.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and allows me to move on to other things.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm making a decision that balances potential profit with the need to secure a sale and avoid unnecessary delays."
