"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference at $12,250? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
