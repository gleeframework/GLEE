"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000.  It's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is less than the $12,000 limit I'm willing to spend, and it's also less than Alice's offer of $9,000. I will then buy the product from John.
