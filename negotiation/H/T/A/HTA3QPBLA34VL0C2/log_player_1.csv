"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to kick off negotiations at $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000)  leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:**  This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to lower offers later.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  Keep in mind you have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net.
* **Negotiation style:**  Be prepared to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses.  This first offer is just the opening move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $2,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's still ample room for negotiation between your initial offer and his. 
* **John as backup:** While John's offer is tempting, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price with Bob before taking the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic drop:** This counteroffer drops by $300,000, signaling some flexibility while still remaining well above Bob's initial offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, you aim to steer Bob away from anchoring solely on his perceived value. 
* **Continuing the dance:** This keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but still insufficient:**  Bob's offer has increased to $1,000,000, which is a positive sign, but it remains below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still a gap to bridge, and we're only in round 4 of 10.
* **John as a safety net:** You still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if needed. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, you should aim for a counteroffer that encourages Bob to move closer to your minimum while also conveying that you're serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump, to be transparent, I do have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense on my end.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and firmness:**  You're being transparent about having a ""hard minimum"" without explicitly revealing the number. This conveys seriousness while still suggesting room for negotiation.
* **Strategic drop:**  The $200,000 drop from your previous offer shows a willingness to compromise but not at the expense of your bottom line.
* **Focus on value:** You're reiterating the product's value to counterbalance Bob's focus on his budget limitations.

**Goal:**  Encourage Bob to make a significant move closer to your range, ideally above the $1,500,000 mark, knowing you have John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Improved offer, but still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement and shows a willingness to meet in the middle. However, it's still below your $1,500,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Time for a strategic decision:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's crucial to decide if you believe Bob will reach your minimum. You need to decide if you want to push for a higher price or take John's offer.

**Next Steps:**  

* **Assess Bob's willingness:** Carefully consider Bob's messaging and previous offers.  Does it seem like he has more room to move, or is he firm at $1,250,000?
* **High-stakes counteroffer:** If you believe Bob might go higher, your next counteroffer should be close to your $1,500,000 minimum. This conveys the seriousness of your position. 
* **Consider John:** If you doubt Bob will reach $1,500,000, accepting John's offer might be the most logical choice to secure the guaranteed amount."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've been giving this offer a lot of thought, and to be completely candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding that price, making this a worthwhile investment.  "", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:**  You've decided to hold firm at your minimum acceptable price. This conveys the seriousness of your position and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the value proposition, emphasizing the potential returns Bob can expect.
* **Time pressure:**  With only three rounds remaining, this creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a final decision.

**Goal:**  Prompt Bob to either accept your minimum price or reveal if he's truly unable (or unwilling) to reach it. You're essentially giving him a final chance before potentially walking away to John's offer."
