Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair price for the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8200}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum desired price.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
