"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my budget of $800,000. If you're truly interested in selling, I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I hope you'll seriously consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  While I value the product, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look at other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
