"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to  purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the immense value and potential returns this product offers.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but $800,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to drop to $900,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end.",900000.0,Alice,5,
