"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and your potential needs. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the starting price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1200000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1000000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm confident that the product's value justifies the higher price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'll meet you in the middle again. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is my absolute last offer, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I respect your position, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $1100000. I am prepared to offer $1050000 as my final counteroffer. This is my best offer, and I hope it is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $1050000. I've already met you halfway and offered $1100000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price of $1200000. If you're unable to do so, I'll have to consider other buyers. The ball is in your court.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
