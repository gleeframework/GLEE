Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving us a good target range.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Offering the product at $1,250,000 leaves both parties with a significant profit. Bob saves $250,000 from his perceived value, and you earn $450,000 above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The language used is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with the backup option of selling to John for $800,000, you're still guaranteed a profit. This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings."
