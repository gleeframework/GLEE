# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given your understanding and potential use for it, I'm offering it to you at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd pay $1,300,000 from Alice vs. $1,500,000 from John.
* **You are still within your budget.**  $1,300,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000. 

It's always best to get the lowest price, and Alice's offer allows you to do that."
