Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given your understanding and potential use for it, I'm offering it to you at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed while aiming for a larger profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""true worth and potential"" aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind against his own valuation.
* **Alternative buyer:** While we have John as a backup, we don't mention him.  Revealing this information could weaken our negotiating position with Bob."
