"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $9,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.  Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great way to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
