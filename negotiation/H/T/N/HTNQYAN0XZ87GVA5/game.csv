"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can confidently say you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9500.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle again at $9750?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",9750.0,Bob,6,
