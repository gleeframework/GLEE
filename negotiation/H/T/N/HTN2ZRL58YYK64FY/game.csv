"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price is still well above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product to you, while also remaining within my budget.  I believe it's a fair deal that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
