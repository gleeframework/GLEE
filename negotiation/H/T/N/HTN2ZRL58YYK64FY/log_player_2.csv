"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. I can definitely get a better price by counter-offering.  I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my desired price range of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are now very close to a mutually beneficial agreement. Accepting her offer of $880,000 will save me $320,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
