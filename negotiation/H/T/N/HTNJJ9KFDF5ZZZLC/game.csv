"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
