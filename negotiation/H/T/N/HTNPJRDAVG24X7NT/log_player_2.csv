"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way above your budget and your maximum price limit ($100).  It's best to start negotiating and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($80), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This leaves room for us to increase our offer gradually.
* **Anchoring:**  Our initial low offer acts as an anchor. While it's unlikely Alice will accept it outright, it may influence her subsequent counteroffers to be lower than if we started with a higher number.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This approach sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation where we can try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down from her initial offer, $125 is still significantly higher than our target price and our maximum price.  We need to show her we're serious about a lower price point.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $125 is still more than I had in mind. Could you do $95? That would be a great price for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer to $95, showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance below our $100 limit.
* **Justification:** We're providing a reason for our counteroffer (""great price for me"") without revealing our absolute maximum price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still a significant amount below Alice's current offer, encouraging her to continue moving towards a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110. We've tried negotiating, but she's holding firm. Since we have the option to buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $10."
