# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
