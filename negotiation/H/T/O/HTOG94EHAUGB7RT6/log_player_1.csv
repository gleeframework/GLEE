Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just your perceived value) makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with an open question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

While I know I have John as a backup, aiming high with Bob first gives me the best chance to maximize my profit."
