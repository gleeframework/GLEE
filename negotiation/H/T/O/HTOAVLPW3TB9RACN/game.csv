,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to facilitate a deal. This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,350,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this now.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal now.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
