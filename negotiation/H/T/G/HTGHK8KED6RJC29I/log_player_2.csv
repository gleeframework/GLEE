"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know you can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and it shows my strong desire to negotiate.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still not a compelling price.  I want to see if she's willing to go lower.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price that is closer to my desired price point, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers and potentially risk losing out on the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product for a decent price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
