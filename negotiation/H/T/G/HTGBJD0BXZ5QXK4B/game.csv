"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price reflects the immense potential this product holds for your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product holds, but I have a strict budget. Could you meet me at $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to accept $825,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. Please consider the value this product brings and let me know your decision.",825000.0,Alice,5,
