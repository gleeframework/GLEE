{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice's initial offer is still within your budget. By rejecting the offer, you can see if you can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This will likely be rejected by Alice, but it establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation. It also signals that I am serious about getting a good deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my initial counteroffer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a lower price than Alice's offer.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground before having to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $30,000 higher than my last counteroffer. While I'd prefer to get it lower, we're getting close to a reasonable deal.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's more likely that further negotiation will lead to a more drawn-out process without a significant price reduction.  Accepting this offer saves time and ensures I get the product for a price significantly lower than John's."
