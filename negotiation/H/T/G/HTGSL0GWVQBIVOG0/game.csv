"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After reviewing the product's value and market trends, I was thinking of a price around $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $950,000 and my valuation is substantial.  This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident in its ability to deliver value exceeding even my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer is still significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly. Let's settle at $1,012,500. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market trends.",985000.0,Bob,6,
