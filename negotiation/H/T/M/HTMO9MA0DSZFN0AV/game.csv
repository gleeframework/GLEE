"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $17,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  While I appreciate you coming down, $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to accept $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
