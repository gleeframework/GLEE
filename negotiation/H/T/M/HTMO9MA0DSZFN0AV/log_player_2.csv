Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $16,000 and we have a guaranteed option at $15,000 with John.  While another round *might* get a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price and us losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 deal."
