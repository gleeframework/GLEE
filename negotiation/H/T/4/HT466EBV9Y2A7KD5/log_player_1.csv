Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's worth significantly more than that, and I know you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit above your minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John."
