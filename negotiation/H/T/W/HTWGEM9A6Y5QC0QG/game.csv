,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $105. Would you be willing to consider that?  We're both close to a deal here.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. $97.50 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
