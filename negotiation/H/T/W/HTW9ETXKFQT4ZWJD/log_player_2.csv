{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always worth exploring options before settling for the initial price. Since you have a backup option with John for $100, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $75 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $100. This shows you're serious about negotiating and sets the stage for potential back and forth. It's a reasonable starting point, giving Alice room to compromise while still allowing you to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial $100, there's still room for negotiation. You're determined to get the best deal possible and with John's offer as a backup, you can continue to try and push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $80 is a compromise between your previous offer of $75 and Alice's offer of $90. It shows that you're willing to meet her halfway, but still striving for a better price. This is a reasonable move to potentially reach an agreement."
