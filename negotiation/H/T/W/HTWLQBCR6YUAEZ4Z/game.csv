"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $825000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $845000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",845000.0,Alice,5,
