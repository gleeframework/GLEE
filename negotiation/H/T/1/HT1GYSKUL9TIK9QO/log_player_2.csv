{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $125 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation.  Bob is still willing to pay more than the product is worth to Alice, which leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $120 is closer to his target price, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Alice has already shown some flexibility, so Bob can use that to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob has shown that he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility, so there's still room for a better deal.  Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate and get closer to Alice's desired price. However, he's still within his budget and is holding out for a final compromise. The counteroffer of $120 is a good compromise considering the previous offers."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he would like to pay.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and there's still time to get a better deal. He's already rejected several offers and has proven that he's not desperate for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final attempt at getting a better deal. He's increasing his offer one last time, aiming for a compromise with Alice.  If this offer is rejected, it's likely that Bob will have to accept Alice's next offer or buy from John.  However, a $125 deal would still be a good outcome for Bob, saving him $25 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, but it's still above Bob's desired price. With only one round left, it's unlikely that Bob can negotiate further and get a better deal. Buying from John for $150 is the best option, as it guarantees that Bob gets the product within his budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise given the limited time and negotiation progress."
