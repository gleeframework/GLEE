"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum price ($120), you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a little higher.  $95 is still a good deal for a product that's worth $120 to you.  How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal compared to John's $120 price, there's still room for negotiation.  You've already established a lower price point with your counteroffer, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  By rejecting and making another counteroffer, you can potentially secure a lower price and maximize your savings."
