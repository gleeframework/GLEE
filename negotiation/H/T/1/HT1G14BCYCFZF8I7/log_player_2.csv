"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, meaning she has a significant margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good compromise. It's still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000 and is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,500. There's no guarantee Bob can get a better price with further negotiation, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
