"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John.
* **The product is still within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is below that threshold."
