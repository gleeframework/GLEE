,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
