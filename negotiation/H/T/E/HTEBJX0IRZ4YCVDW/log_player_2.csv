# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than your maximum price of $80 and higher than John's offer of $80. You can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
