"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the counteroffer.  However, $10500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $11250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I've carefully reviewed our negotiations, and I believe a fair price for the product would be $10750. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
