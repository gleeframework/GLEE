{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below my minimum:** It's still above my minimum of $12,000, but that's where John comes in as a backup. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a better price from Bob, while still having a guaranteed sale with John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as that's below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's a lower price than my initial offer:** Shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** Protects my interests and ensures I don't lose money. 
* **It's a strong position for further negotiations:** Leaves room for a potential middle ground if Bob still isn't satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but getting closer. I'll counteroffer again to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the counteroffer.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

This counteroffer uses a few strategies:

* **Middle ground:**  $11,250 is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's latest offer ($10,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Strong language:** Phrases like ""significant compromise"" and ""fair price"" highlight the effort I'm making to find a solution. This can encourage Bob to accept or at least consider a final compromise.
* **Open-ended approach:**  ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" keeps the negotiation open for potential concessions from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I've carefully reviewed our negotiations, and I believe a fair price for the product would be $10750. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've been going back and forth for several rounds.  While I could counteroffer again, it's getting increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement.  I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer, so I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from him."
