"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This offer is still within my budget and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
