I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is closer to my desired range and it's unlikely he'll offer more. Accepting this offer secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
