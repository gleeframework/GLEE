Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit. I'm confident that I can get at least $150 from John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer, hopefully enticing him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum desired price of $150. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident that I can still make a profit on this sale."
