Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum allows for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives you a strong bargaining position. You don't *need* to go below that.

**Why this is better than offering $10,000 directly:**

* Offering the maximum might make Bob suspicious or feel like he's not getting any kind of deal. 
* It leaves no room for Bob to feel good about potentially ""winning"" a negotiation, which can be psychologically beneficial in a sale."
