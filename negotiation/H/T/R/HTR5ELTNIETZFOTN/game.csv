"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price for your product, but $110 is still a bit more than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and settle at $95? I'm really keen on buying this from you.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $95. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $95. It's the absolute most I can afford. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,6,,
