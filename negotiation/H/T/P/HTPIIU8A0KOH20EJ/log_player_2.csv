"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative at $150 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. There's always the possibility of getting a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower offer is a common negotiation tactic. By offering $100, you're signaling that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to pay significantly less than Alice's initial price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your desired price. You have a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into a decision. Continuing to negotiate with Alice gives you a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Offering $115 shows that you're willing to compromise but also that you're not ready to accept their price just yet. This keeps the pressure on Alice to continue negotiating and hopefully meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to your maximum acceptable price of $150. It's likely that if you continue to negotiate, she might offer a lower price, but there's also a chance she might increase the price or walk away. Accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a reasonable price, saving you $10 compared to buying from John."
