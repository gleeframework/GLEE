"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a price that makes sense for both of us.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $900000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This represents a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $950000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle and consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to find a mutually beneficial solution, $920000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935000. This would be a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,
