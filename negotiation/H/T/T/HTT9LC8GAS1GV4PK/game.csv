"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000, which would be $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,250 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $11,750. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,6,
