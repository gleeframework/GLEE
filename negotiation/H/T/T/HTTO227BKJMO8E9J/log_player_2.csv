"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is a decent price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice knows the product's value to you and is likely starting high. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
