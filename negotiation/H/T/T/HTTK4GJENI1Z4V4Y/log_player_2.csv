"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's discuss a price in the range of $1,200,000, which would allow you substantial savings while still ensuring a strong return on your investment.  I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly anchoring you to a high price, knowing your maximum is $1,500,000. While $1,200,000 is a ""saving"" compared to John's price, it's likely Alice is willing to go much lower. By rejecting this initial offer, you create room for negotiation and the potential to get a much better deal."
