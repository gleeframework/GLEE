"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price for you considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiation."
