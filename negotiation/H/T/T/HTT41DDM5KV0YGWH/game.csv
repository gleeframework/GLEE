"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $22000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $16000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your original offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I can meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $20000? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'm thinking of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
