"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still too low for me, considering the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $1,075,000 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $1,075,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000 just yet.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer in the next round. If that doesn't work, I'll sell to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm running out of time. I'd rather get my minimum value from John than risk losing out entirely."
