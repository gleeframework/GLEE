"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,175,000? That's still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,000,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $1,075,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $1,125,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
