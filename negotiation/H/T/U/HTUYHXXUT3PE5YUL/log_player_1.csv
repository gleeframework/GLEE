Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what John is willing to pay. This is a good starting point to see if I can get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120.  This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I will reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is a final compromise. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'll take John's offer of $150 and secure a good profit."
