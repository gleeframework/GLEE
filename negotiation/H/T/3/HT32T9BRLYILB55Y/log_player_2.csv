# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  You can then see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we start at $7,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, $8,500 is still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate. You can try to counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your target price of $7,500."
