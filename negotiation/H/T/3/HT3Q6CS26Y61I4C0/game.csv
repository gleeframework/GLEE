"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're proposing is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to our respective targets. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to a workable figure, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this worthwhile.  My final offer is $1,200,000.  This offer represents the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
