,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $165? I think it's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to pay $145. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase from John for $120.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $155. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to meet at least this price.",155.0,Alice,5,
