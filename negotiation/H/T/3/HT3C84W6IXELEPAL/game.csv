"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,200 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $10,800.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,600. This is my final offer, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal for you.",10600.0,Alice,7,
