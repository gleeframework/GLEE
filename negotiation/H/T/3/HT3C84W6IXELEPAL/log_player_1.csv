``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness:** I'm keeping the message open-ended to allow for Bob's response and counteroffers. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This starting point gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still achieving a profit above my minimum."

Round 2

* **Risk of time:**  We're already in round 6, and the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to accept a price below my minimum is increasing.
* **Weighing options:**  While selling to John guarantees my desired profit, I'm still trying to maximize my earnings. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob in the remaining rounds.
