Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, hoping Bob will be willing to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my price downwards in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for such a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the point where I'll consider buying from John, but I'm still interested in your product. How about $78? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him.  It's better to guarantee the $80 sale with John."
