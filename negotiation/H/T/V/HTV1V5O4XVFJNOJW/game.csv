"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is quite steep. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are finding some middle ground. $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be open to $10,000?  That's a fair offer, considering my limitations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
