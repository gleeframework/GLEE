"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 97.50} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $97.50. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a deal within my budget. Could you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. He's still stuck at $95, and I'm not willing to go lower than $97.50 at this point. I'm hoping I can convince him to come up a little in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $96. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 96}
``` 
 
I'm making a final offer of $96. This is a small compromise but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal before I have to resort to selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $95 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubborn and won't budge from $95.  I've already lowered my price significantly from my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.   It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is a much better deal for me."
