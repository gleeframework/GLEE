"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  This would still be a good deal for you and leaves some room for us both to be happy. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's work together to make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
