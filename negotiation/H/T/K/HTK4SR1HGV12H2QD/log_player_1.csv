{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this strategy will give me the best chance of reaching a deal that benefits both of us, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  This would still be a good deal for you and leaves some room for us both to be happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
