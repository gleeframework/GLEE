"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would still be a good deal for you and leaves some room for us both to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise or that Bob might end up paying the full $12,000 to John.  Accepting this offer is the best option to ensure a good price while also minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
