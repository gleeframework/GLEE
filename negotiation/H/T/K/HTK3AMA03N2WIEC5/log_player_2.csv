"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  How does $140 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
* Alice is offering the product for $140, which is a better price than John's $150.
* However, you are trying to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price or find another seller with a better deal."
