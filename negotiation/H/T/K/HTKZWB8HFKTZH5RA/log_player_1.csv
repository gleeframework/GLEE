{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum value, but also leaves room for potential negotiation.  This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still giving you a chance to potentially earn more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to the $115 price point. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference at $107.50.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $107.50 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $110, and it is significantly higher than the $100 I would get from John. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept."
