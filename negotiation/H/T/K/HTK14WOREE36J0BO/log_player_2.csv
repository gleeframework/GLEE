"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,400,000 is less than $1,500,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even at $1,400,000, you're paying less than your maximum of $1,500,000."
