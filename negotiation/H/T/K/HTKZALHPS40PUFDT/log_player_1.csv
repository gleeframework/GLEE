Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product, but are not desperate to sell it at a low price.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, we can likely do better. It's worth another round of negotiation. We'll counter with a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

We're coming down a bit, but still maintaining a strong position. This offer is closer to our initial value proposition while showing Bob that we're willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above our minimum acceptable price and close to what John is offering.  It's time to take the deal and secure the sale."
