"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice. However, $17,000 is still too high for my budget. Could you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $14,500? That's a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  However, there's still a significant gap between what I'm comfortable paying and your offer.  How about we settle on $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
