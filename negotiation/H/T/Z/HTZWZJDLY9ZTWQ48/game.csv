"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $9500 is lower than what I had hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $10250?  This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10250 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about $9750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9750.0,Bob,4,
