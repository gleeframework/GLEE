"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  Since I have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I have enough rounds left to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $13,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I know it holds, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm happy to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm unwilling to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum value, and it's better than potentially losing a sale entirely with Bob."
