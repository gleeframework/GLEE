"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer of $80, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I think the product is great, $125 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob! I can do $115, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm happy to go up to $105, but that's really my limit. Let's see if we can make this happen.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob! I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we can make it work.",110.0,Alice,7,
