"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to improve the price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reflects Bob's desire to get a lower price while still being reasonable.  It's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for further negotiation.  The message is friendly and aims to establish a collaborative tone, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This still gives you a good value, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $10,000. While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to pay John's higher price is too high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and saves him $1,000 compared to John's offer."
