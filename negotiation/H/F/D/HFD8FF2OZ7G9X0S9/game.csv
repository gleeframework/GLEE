"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? That's still a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $14,500. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and my previous offer of $13,500. How about we try $13,750? That's the best I can do.",13750.0,Bob,6,
