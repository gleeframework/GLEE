"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can do $90, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. It's still a great price for a fantastic product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
