"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That's still a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but $11,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
