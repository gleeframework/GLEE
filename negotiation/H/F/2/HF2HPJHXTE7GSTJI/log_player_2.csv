"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This product has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth to you, which we estimate to be around $10,000, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, and I hope you'll find it compelling. If this offer aligns with your budget and requirements, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still significantly higher than what you know you can get the product for from John ($10,000). By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high.  There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to her $8,000 value.  If not, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
