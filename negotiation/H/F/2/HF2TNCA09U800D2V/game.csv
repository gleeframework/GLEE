"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's a price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
