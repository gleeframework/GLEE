"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 for it. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers, and I buy it for $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
