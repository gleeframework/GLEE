"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 for it. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $825,000. It's better to buy from John for $800,000 and save the $25,000."
