You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000.
* **Your Value:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** A starting counteroffer of $10,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** Alice is now offering $12,500, which is a slight increase from her previous offer.
* **Your goal:** You're aiming to get the product for the lowest possible price, ideally under $12,000.
* **John's offer:** John is selling for $15,000, making Alice's offer still a better option.
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.

You should continue the negotiation process with Alice.  Even though her offer is better than John's, you can potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is likely willing to sell for a price closer to $10,000 than her offer of $12,500.
* **Your Value:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  A counteroffer of $11,000 is a reasonable middle ground. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, showing you're serious about buying, but still a lower price than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** Alice is now offering $13,000. While this is lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than your ideal price.
* **Your goal:** You are aiming to get the product for the lowest possible price.
* **John's offer:** John is selling for $15,000, which is higher than Alice's current offer, but you've been unable to get Alice lower than $13,000.
* **Negotiation:**  It's likely that continuing to negotiate with Alice will result in further price increases.

It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point.  While it's not the ideal price, it's the best option available to you, given the negotiation history and your desire to purchase the product."
