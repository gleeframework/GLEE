"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9000, and I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment.",9500.0,Alice,5,
