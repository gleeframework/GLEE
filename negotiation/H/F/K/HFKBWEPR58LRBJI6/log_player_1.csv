{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am interested, but I can't afford $9,500 at this time. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't commit to $9,000. Would it be possible to consider $8,750 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's better to close the deal with him rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
