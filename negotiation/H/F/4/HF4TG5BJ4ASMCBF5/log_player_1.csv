**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his $10,000 valuation and seems unlikely to move significantly higher.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk:

* **Wasting time:**  We only have a limited number of rounds.
* **Leaving money on the table:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is already better than Bob's current offer. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
