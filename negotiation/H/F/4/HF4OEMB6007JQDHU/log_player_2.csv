Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1500000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. It's a significant difference from my previous offer. However, I'm willing to compromise.
