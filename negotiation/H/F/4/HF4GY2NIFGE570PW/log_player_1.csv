Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $11,000.  I think it's a great deal for you, given its value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While $11,000 is above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), it's still a significant discount from what John is willing to pay. Alice's message aims to highlight the product's value to persuade Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's true valuation or his negotiation limits."
