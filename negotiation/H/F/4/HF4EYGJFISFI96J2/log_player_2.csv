"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's start at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product for $120 from John, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's closer to his target price of $120. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise between his initial offer and Alice's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $135. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $135 is closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $120 from John.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to negotiate and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $135.  I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's price, but he's still aiming to save money.  $130 is a compromise between their positions, and it allows for the potential for a deal to be reached in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. I understand your position and I'm willing to compromise further. I would like to offer the product at $128. This is my final offer. I hope it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $128 is a good price and getting closer to Bob's target, he can still get the product from John for $120.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to try and get the price down to $120 or very close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $128 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $125.  If you're able to come down just a little bit more, we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for the best possible deal, aiming for $120. His counteroffer of $125 is a slight increase from his previous offer, indicating his willingness to compromise, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after careful consideration, I am willing to accept $126 for the product. This is my final offer. I believe it strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a couple of key considerations here:

* **Price:**  $126 is only $6 more than John's price. While saving that $6 would be great, the chance of getting it down to $120 is unlikely at this point.
* **Rounds:** This is round 7. There are only 3 rounds left. The risk is that Alice might walk away and Bob won't be able to get the product at all.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision. It secures the product at a reasonable price with a minimal amount of risk."
