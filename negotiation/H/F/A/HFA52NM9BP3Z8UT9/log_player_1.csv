{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. 
* This initial offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a good starting point. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop that low. I will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also acknowledging his budget constraints.
* I'm offering a counter-price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial target, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's likely that further negotiations will only yield a small increase in price, and it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by continuing to haggle. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $1,025,000 ensures a sale with a profit that is significantly better than my other option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
