"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. This is my final compromise, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
