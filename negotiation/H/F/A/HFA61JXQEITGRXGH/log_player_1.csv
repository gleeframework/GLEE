Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** An initial offer of $170 allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This offer helps determine how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to pay a premium. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
