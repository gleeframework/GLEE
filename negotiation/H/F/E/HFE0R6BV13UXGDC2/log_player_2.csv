"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $120. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $120.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John than to potentially waste more time negotiating with Alice."
