Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it is worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $18,000. This offer is valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 18000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** The 24-hour deadline adds a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a quicker decision.
* **Knowing the backup option:** Alice is secure knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob declines, ensuring a minimum profit.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
