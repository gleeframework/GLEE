"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price before even considering accepting.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I have the backup option of John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $75. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upward while staying well below my $100 limit.
* **Polite and Open:**  My message is polite and shows I'm interested, but also firm about my budget. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see how much Alice is willing to move from her $200 starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $75 is too low for me.  Could you do $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice lowered her price, but only by $30.  It seems like she's not very flexible at this point. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:** I'm raising my offer, but only to $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a pace that favors Alice's high starting price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer is getting close to my maximum, so I want to gauge Alice's reaction carefully. If she rejects this, I may have to seriously consider John's offer. 
* **Limited Time:** With each round, the value of a potential deal with Alice decreases, as I'm running out of time to secure the best possible outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. How about we split the difference and call it $130? That's a significant discount from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach, the starting point of that split is still heavily skewed towards her initial high price. I need to make it clear that a deal closer to my budget is necessary. I'm very close to taking John's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $130 is still too far from what I had in mind. This product is only worth $100 to me, and I have another option at that price. If you'd be willing to come down to $95, I think we could close this deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is likely my final offer.  I'm making it clear that I have an alternative at $100, putting a hard limit on what I'm willing to pay.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm expressing the need to close the deal soon, implying that I might take the other offer if she doesn't budge.
* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer as a gesture of good faith, but it's a small concession to try to get Alice to agree."
