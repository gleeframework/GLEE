Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $75. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. How about we split the difference and call it $130? That's a significant discount from my original price."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $130 is still too far from what I had in mind. This product is only worth $100 to me, and I have another option at that price. If you'd be willing to come down to $95, I think we could close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge much past $100.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly higher than his offer. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a worse offer from Bob in later rounds."
