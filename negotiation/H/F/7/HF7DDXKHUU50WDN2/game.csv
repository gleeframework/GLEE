"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $75 is too low for me.  Could you do $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. How about we split the difference and call it $130? That's a significant discount from my original price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $130 is still too far from what I had in mind. This product is only worth $100 to me, and I have another option at that price. If you'd be willing to come down to $95, I think we could close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
