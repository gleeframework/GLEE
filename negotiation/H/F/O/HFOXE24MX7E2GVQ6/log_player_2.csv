{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be gradually increasing her offers, but she's still above my target price.  I'm raising my offer to $8,900, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but keeping the price below my personal limit.  It's time to see if Alice will meet me in the middle."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are consistently above my target price. While I'm still willing to negotiate, we're now in round 7, and I only have 3 rounds left.  The risk of not finding a suitable price with Alice is too high. Buying from John guarantees I get the product within my budget, even if it's at the top end."
