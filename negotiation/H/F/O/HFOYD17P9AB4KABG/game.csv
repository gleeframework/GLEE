"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. While $775000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go to $750000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $765000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.
