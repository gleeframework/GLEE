``` 

The product is too expensive at $2,000,000. We should try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price.  We can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  $1,000,000 is a big drop from Alice's asking price. We'll see if she's willing to come down."

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit. We can try to negotiate further.  Let's see if we can get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's try a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise and hopefully will get Alice closer to my target price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,600,000, which is closer to my limit but still too high. I'd like to see if I can get a lower price.  Let's try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,400,000}

Let's try a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is getting close to my limit, and I think Alice might be willing to accept it to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my limit. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely we'll just go back and forth. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer for $1,500,000."
