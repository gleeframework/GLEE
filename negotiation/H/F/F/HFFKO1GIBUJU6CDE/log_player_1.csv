Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start at $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a higher price. While $120 is my minimum, I think I can get more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $125 is a good compromise and it's higher than what John is offering.  I'm also running out of rounds and need to make a decision."
