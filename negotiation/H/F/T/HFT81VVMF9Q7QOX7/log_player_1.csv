"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think it's a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $100. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, seeing if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about $102.50? It's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering how much this product is worth."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to make a decision on this product. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more for the product, Bob isn't budging much and I only have a few rounds left. I'm not comfortable going below $100, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is a sure bet, and selling to him will guarantee me my minimum."
