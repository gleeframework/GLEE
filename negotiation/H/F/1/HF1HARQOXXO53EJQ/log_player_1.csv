{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a good idea to frame the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing the value for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my target.  I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's a step closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1380000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $1365000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable value, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's more profitable to accept his offer and secure the sale than risk going back and forth and potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
