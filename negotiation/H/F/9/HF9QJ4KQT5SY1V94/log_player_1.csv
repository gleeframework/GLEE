Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counter without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're serious about selling, but also that you're not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is still a good price, it's worth pushing for a higher offer.  It's possible Bob will budge if you counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I'm confident this price will be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,350,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,325,000 is not the ideal price, it is closer to your initial offer and significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000. It's crucial to recognize that the negotiation is nearing its end, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
