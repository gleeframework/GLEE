"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $100, which is less than Alice's $90 offer. 

While you always want to try and save money, paying $10 less to John is a better deal than what Alice is offering."
