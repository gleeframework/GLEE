Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to stay in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Given my budget, I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's not worth risking a protracted negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
