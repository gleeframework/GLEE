"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident this product is valuable to both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're still not comfortable with my last offer.  While I'm eager to get this product, I'm still limited by my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. If this isn't acceptable, I might have to consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to work with me at that price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
