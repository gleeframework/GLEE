Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,200,000 is less than the $1,500,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:** This price is a fair starting point for negotiation, showing Bob that you're serious about reaching a deal. 

This approach allows for flexibility in the negotiation while still protecting your minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to secure a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  $950,000 is a decent profit, but it leaves a lot of money on the table. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting the offer, you show Bob that you're willing to hold firm on your expectations, potentially leading to a higher counteroffer from him.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is always a backup option, but the potential for a better deal with Bob is worth exploring.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  Consider a price between $950,000 and $1,200,000 to encourage further negotiation."
