"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
