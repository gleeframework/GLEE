"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,000,000. 
* However, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and increase the chances of her coming down in price."
