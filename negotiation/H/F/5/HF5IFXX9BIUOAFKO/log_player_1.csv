Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a fantastic price of $175. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fantastic price"" and ""great deal,"" you aim to frame the offer positively, even though it's above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to respond, potentially starting a negotiation.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, it's ideal to secure a deal with Bob at the highest possible price."
