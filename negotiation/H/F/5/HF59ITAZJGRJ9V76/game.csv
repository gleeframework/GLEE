"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've offered it for initially."
"I've taken your offer into consideration, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $14000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the initial offer I made.",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $13200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."
"I've made one final compromise, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13200. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling it to another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum of $12000.",13200.0,Alice,5,,
