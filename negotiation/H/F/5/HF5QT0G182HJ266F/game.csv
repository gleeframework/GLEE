"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can't go lower than $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $8,625, but that's as high as I can go.",8625.0,Bob,6,
