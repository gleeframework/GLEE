"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your point about the product's potential, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your previous offer of $1,900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
