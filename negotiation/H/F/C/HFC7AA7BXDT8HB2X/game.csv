"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
