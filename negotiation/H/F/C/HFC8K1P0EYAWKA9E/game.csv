"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $950,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin and is a fair price for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and I believe we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
