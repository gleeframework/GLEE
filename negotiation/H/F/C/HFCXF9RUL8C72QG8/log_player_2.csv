"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. I'm asking for $135. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $135, while John wants $150.
* **The product is worth more to you:** You value the product at $150, so even paying $135 is a good deal.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $15 compared to buying from John."
