Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you. 

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (so he doesn't reject it) but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 backup, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Positioning the product as having ""unique value"" subtly reinforces its worth.
* **High but Fair Price:** $1,150,000 lets you capture a significant portion of Bob's potential profit ($50,000) while still leaving him with a $50,000 gain. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid providing reasons for the price.  Let Bob respond and potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation. If you have the opportunity for multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers, you might start even higher to test Bob's willingness to pay."
