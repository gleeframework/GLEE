"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $100. 
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is still within your budget.
* While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower than $95, and you might risk losing the deal altogether.
*  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is within your budget."
