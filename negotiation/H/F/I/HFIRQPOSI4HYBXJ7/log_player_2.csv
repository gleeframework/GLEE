"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's not even close to your maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $10,000, it's the best starting point for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it sets a firm lower bound and will hopefully encourage her to come down from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget. I can try to negotiate further with her in hopes of getting closer to my target price of $10,000. While buying from John for $10,000 is a safe option, I am willing to take a chance on continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,000 to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, she'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my ideal price but within my budget of $10,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation. The potential for additional negotiation is outweighed by the fact that I'm already close to my maximum price and the risk of her rejecting my next counteroffer."
