Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Above Bob's value:** I'm setting the price above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a higher price.
* **Leaving room for John:**  By starting at $17,000, I still have room to negotiate down to $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer and I decide to deal with John. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though John is willing to pay $15,000, I'm going to see if I can get closer to that with Bob.  There's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Balancing risk:** I want to try and find a middle ground where I can get a reasonable price without risking losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower amount.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm not willing to settle for $11,000 yet.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, hoping to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm making a final attempt to find a middle ground with Bob by lowering my offer to $12,000. 
* **Balancing risk:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely. 
* **Potential for agreement:**  $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it.

Let's see if Bob is willing to agree on this price!"
