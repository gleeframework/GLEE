"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,325,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a good deal for you, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
