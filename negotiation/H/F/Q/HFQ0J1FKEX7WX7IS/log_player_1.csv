Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the value to Bob while leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer leaves room for both parties to negotiate, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but I still have room to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground. This keeps the negotiation moving and potentially leads to a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a step closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This price is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above Bob's perceived value but closer to his offer.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes a compromise, highlighting the potential benefits for both parties.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming to reach a deal closer to my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility while maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. How about we try $1,125,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that I could end up losing time and potentially earning less. 

**Strategy:**

Given the closeness of the price to my minimum, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's still a significant amount of money."
