Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum).

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start with a strong, yet polite tone, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 profit margin, which is still significant.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price gives you some wiggle room to negotiate down slightly if Bob counters, while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to open slightly lower to avoid an immediate impasse.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, consider a slightly more generous price to foster goodwill."
