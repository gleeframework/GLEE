It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have room to go lower than $100."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $80.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
