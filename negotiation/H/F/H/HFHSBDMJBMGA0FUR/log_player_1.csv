"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer, or counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with Bob's initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further in hopes of getting a better price.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price to $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum price. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer and the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $90 is a good price and is closer to my initial offer of $100. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $80.  I'm happy to close the deal."
