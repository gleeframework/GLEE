Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be fair to both of us, let's aim for $1,250,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
