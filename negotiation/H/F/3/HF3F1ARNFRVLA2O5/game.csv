"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8000. It's my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
