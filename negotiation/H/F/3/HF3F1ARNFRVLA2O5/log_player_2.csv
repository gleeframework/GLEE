# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000. It's my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems Alice is unwilling to come down further.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
