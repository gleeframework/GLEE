Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to John's offer ($10,000) risks losing the opportunity to make a larger profit.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
