"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Ensures a decent profit:**  It's above your minimum value, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **Sets a strong initial position:**  By starting high, you give yourself space to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to your minimum value, you can still push for a higher price.  You have 8 rounds left, and by rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your ideal $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $90 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $100. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $95 shows you're willing to negotiate while still trying to get closer to your initial price.
* **Positive framing:**  Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both parties can make the offer more appealing.
* **Remaining above your minimum:**  This counteroffer ensures you're still making a decent profit even if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to your desired price of $95, and it's well above your minimum value of $80.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely you won't get a much better price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids risking a deal with John for a lower price."
