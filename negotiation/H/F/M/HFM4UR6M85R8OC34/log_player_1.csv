Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This leaves me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages a productive conversation. 

I'm also ready to walk away if Bob proves unreasonable, as I have another buyer lined up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by the $10,000, it's below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer.  I believe I can get closer to my $12,000 target or at least find a compromise that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
