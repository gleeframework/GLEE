Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be of significant value to you, even though it's worth a substantial amount to me. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its importance â€“ $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""substantial value"" to both parties aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to my asking price.

**The goal is to maximize profit while still enticing Bob enough to accept the offer instead of letting me go to John.**"
