"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to consider $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. $1,000,000 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that ensures I receive a fair return on this asset. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
