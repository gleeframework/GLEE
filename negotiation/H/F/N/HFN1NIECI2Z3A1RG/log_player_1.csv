Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute lowest point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  Any price above this is a loss for him.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represent potential deals where both you and Bob could benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not scare Bob off.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have some leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I've received significant interest, but I believe you would be a perfect fit. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the exclusivity and Bob's potential fit to pique his interest.
* **High Price (but within reason):** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Confidence:**  By stating your price confidently, you signal the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to create more room for back-and-forth.
* **Relationship Value:** Is there a long-term relationship with Bob you want to foster? A slightly lower price might be worth it in that case."
