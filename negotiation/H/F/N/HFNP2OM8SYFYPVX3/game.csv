"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still struggling to justify that price point for my budget. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $962,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution here.  I understand your budget considerations, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  I could consider $1,000,000. This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it's one that will pay off significantly for you in the long run.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there yet on the price. Let's split the difference once more and go with $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it'll make this a successful deal for both parties.",975000.0,Bob,6,
