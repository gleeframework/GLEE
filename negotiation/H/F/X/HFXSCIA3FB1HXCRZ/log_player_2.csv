"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and even lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000).  This indicates there is room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a bit closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This should encourage her to continue negotiating without immediately resorting to her counteroffer.  It's a reasonable starting point for a give-and-take scenario."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your enthusiasm for the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than her initial offer and is within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I want to avoid the risk of Alice backing out or John raising his price.  I'm comfortable with this price and want to close the deal."
