,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can we try to get closer to my original offer of $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Can you consider that?,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we compromise at $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and it's fair for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",109.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108.50, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",108.5,Bob,8,
