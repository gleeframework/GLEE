"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? ",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can do $130. That's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
