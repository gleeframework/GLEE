Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I earn more than John's offer.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$6,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a better return than I'd get selling to John."", ""product_price"": 8000}
