"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $10,000 for it. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm confident in the product's value at $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $11,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",11250.0,Bob,4,
