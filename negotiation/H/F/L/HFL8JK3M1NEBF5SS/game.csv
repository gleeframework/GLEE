"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $80.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
