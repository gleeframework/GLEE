"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a significant discount from my minimum price but still allows me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also setting the tone by highlighting the value the product holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about we aim for $900,000? I think this would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal, especially since I have a fallback option with John.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $925,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still lower than your initial proposal. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. I also need to consider the limited rounds left.  It's likely that further negotiation will take us back and forth, potentially wasting time and reducing my final profit. Selling to Bob at this price ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
