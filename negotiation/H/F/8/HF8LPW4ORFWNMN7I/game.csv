"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to keep your investment within a certain budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $1075000? It's a compromise that still brings value to both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1075000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1072500? It's a compromise that's closer to your target, but still reflects the product's value.",1072500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1065000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1080000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to end the negotiation here if we can agree on this number.",1080000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1095000? It's a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1095000.0,Alice,9,
