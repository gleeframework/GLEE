It's always worth trying to negotiate and get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's still attractive to me but leaves room for further negotiation.  We'll see how Alice responds."

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}

I'm making a final counteroffer that's just a little bit higher than my previous one. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Alice to close the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

While I'd prefer to get it for my last counteroffer, Alice is getting closer to my target price. It's becoming risky to continue negotiating as we're nearing the halfway point of the rounds. It's time to close the deal and secure the product."
