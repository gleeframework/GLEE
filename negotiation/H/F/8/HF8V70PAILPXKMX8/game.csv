"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me and your bottom line.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm hopeful we can come to a final agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'll meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price. Let me know if this works for you!",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $950,000 is still above my budget. Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering you $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. It's a win-win situation, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925,000. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price. Let me know if this works for you!",975000.0,Alice,7,
