"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and still well above my minimum. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1000000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $975000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great value for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
