"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm offering it for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion and that the price isn't set in stone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more. I'm not in a hurry, and I have 8 more rounds to try to get a better price. There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go a little higher if I push back a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125, but that's my absolute lowest. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My message conveys that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also firm about my lower limit. 
* **Incentive:**  I'm offering a price that's still a good deal for Bob, while also ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm still interested, but $125 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $110, which is a good price for me. It's above my minimum of $100 and getting closer to my initial asking price. I'm not sure if I can get any higher in the remaining rounds, so it's a good time to accept and close the deal."
