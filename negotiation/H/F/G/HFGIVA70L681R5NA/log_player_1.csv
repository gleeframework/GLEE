Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth around $800,000. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the potential value for Bob can make the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to your minimum acceptable amount. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed offer from John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this approach could backfire."
