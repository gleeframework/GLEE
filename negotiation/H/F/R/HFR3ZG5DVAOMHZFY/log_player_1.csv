Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider that?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is getting closer to my target, I think I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I've reached the point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly not willing to go higher than $880,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $890,000.  To avoid risking losing the sale altogether, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best option available at this point."
