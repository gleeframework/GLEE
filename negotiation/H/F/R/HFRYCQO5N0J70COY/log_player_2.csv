You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down.  Even if she doesn't, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (25%) shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating. This also gives her room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I'm confident I can get a better deal. There's no harm in seeing if I can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price lower than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, I'm still confident I can get it lower.  I've shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price in hopes of finding a price I'm even more comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time by a smaller amount, showing that I'm close to my upper limit but still willing to compromise.  This is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and should hopefully push us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, we're getting close to my maximum. Alice is clearly not going to budge much further, and I only have a few rounds left. It's likely that if I reject this offer, Alice will counter with something closer to her initial $950,000 or even higher. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still a decent saving compared to John's offer."
