"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would really benefit you, and I'm asking for $130 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking for $130.  This leaves a significant profit margin for her, and you can likely negotiate a better price.
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so there's no rush to accept the first offer. 
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  You can always buy from John for $150, so you have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  By offering $100, you're making a significant move to lower the price. 
* **Reasonable but not insultingly low:**  $100 is still higher than Alice's value for the product, leaving room for a compromise. 
* **Open to negotiation:** You've framed the offer as a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, $115 is still more than you're comfortable paying. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but it's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** You're not desperate, so you can continue negotiating without feeling pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $115 is closer, but I'm still a bit high.  How about $110? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:**  You're showing that you're taking Alice's offer seriously but are still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  You're framing the offer as a win-win situation, appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Close to your target:** $110 is getting you closer to your desired price range."
