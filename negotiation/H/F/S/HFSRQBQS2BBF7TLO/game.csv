"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $135? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us.,132.5,Bob,4,
