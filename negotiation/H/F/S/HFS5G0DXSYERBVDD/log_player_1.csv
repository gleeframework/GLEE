This offer starts at a price that is significantly above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to communicate the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only $1,000,000, which is your minimum. It's worth trying to see if you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $1,000,000 is a fair starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000 to reflect the product's full potential value. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still comfortable with $1,000,000 as a fair price. It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob has firmly stuck to his offer of $1,000,000, and there's no indication he's willing to budge.  While I'd prefer to earn more,  selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
