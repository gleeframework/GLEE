Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000. 
* **Bob's perceived value:** $10,000.
* **John's offer:** $15,000. 

Since I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, I'm willing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm offering $14,000, which is a good price for Bob (above his perceived value) and still gives me a decent profit. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still having a backup option."
