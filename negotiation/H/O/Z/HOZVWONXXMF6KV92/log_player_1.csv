Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm also aware that I can always fall back to selling to John for $10,000 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows flexibility while still allowing for a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and better than selling to John for $10,000. It seems Bob is not willing to negotiate any further, so accepting his offer seems like the best option to ensure a sale."
