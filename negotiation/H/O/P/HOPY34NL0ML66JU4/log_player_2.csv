"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price. You can still buy the product from John for $80 if negotiations with Alice fail."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  While John's offer is tempting,  Alice might be willing to come down a bit further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go lower than $92, which is still more than what John is offering.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
