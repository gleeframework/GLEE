{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can aim significantly higher. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It shows confidence in the product's value.
* **50% Markup:** The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from our minimum acceptable price. This leaves potential for a very profitable deal.

It's important to note that this is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, we might adjust the price slightly downwards while still aiming to maximize our profit."
