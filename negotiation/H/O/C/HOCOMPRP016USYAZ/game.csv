"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $90.  What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I can do $105, and that's as close to the middle as I'm willing to get. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",105.0,Alice,7,
