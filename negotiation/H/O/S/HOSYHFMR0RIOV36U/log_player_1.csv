While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $11,500.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500?

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to move much further. Accepting $11,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
