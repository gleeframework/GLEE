"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

This initial offer serves a few purposes:

* **Sets the tone:** It signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Room for negotiation:** It allows for a potential negotiation process without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the waters:** It gives me a sense of Bob's interest level and how high he's willing to go.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and proceed accordingly, keeping my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John in mind."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  

Here's why I'm choosing to reject:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is showing interest, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This puts pressure on Bob to increase his offer.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,400,000. Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm reducing my initial offer by $100,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a margin:** $1,400,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he's set on his previous offer.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,350,000, which is closer to my desired price. 
* **Time is a factor:** We are now in round 4, and it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement before running out of time.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While $1,350,000 is less than my ideal, it's still $350,000 more than I'd receive from selling to John. 

By accepting, I secure a profitable deal and avoid the risk of running out of rounds and having to settle for John's offer."
