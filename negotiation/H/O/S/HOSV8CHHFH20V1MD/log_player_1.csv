I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to drop my price that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a more reasonable price point, still above my minimum acceptable offer, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low. While I'm getting closer to his desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the amount. I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. At this point, I'm confident that John will buy the product if Bob rejects the offer. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and agree."
