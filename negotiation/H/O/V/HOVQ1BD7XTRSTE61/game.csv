"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that can generate substantial returns. Consider this offer carefully, as it's the best I can do. If you decline, I will be selling it to another interested party.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
