It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. $85 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $75 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still a fair price for me."

I'm still holding out for a better price. Alice is getting closer, but I'm not ready to give in just yet."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

I'm going to offer Alice $85. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still less than her last offer.  I'm hoping we can reach a compromise here."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, and while I'd love to get it lower, it's getting close to my limit. It's better to take the deal now than risk missing out and having to buy from John at a higher price."
