"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, considering our previous offers. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
