"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. There's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer will allow you to work towards a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a low counteroffer can help gauge Alice's flexibility. While $5,000 is significantly below Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation and helps establish your target price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still $1,000 more than what John offers.  There's no harm in seeing if you can negotiate a slightly lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price while still staying within your budget. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By splitting the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($5,000), you're suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $8,000 if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, considering our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take advantage of the guaranteed lower price with John."
