"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds a significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $1,300,000. This offer is designed to provide you with a substantial savings compared to its intrinsic value of $1,200,000 to you, while also ensuring a fair return on my investment. I trust that we can come to an agreement that satisfies both our interests. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save Bob $100,000."
