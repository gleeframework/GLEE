"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum, it's still much lower than my initial offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That seems like a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,750 is still below my desired price point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking for a bit more for the product.  How about we settle on $10,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of what you're getting.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm sticking to a price that's still above my minimum, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he sees this as a good compromise and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit off.  Would you consider $9,850? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $9,900.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
``` 

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still close to my target price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to agree."
