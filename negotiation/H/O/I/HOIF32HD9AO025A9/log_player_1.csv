Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $700,000 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original ask is more appropriate. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Would you consider $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, and $825,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
