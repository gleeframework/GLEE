Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the possibility of listing the product publicly creates a sense of urgency and implies you have other interested buyers.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is open for discussion, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's a chance he might counter with a price higher than $10,000, still giving Alice a chance to earn more than John's offer."
