,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us. ",110.0,Alice,3,
