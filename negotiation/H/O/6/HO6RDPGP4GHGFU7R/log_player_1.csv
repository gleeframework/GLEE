"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can get the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. How about if we aim for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm hoping to get closer to that value. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $105 is still a bit too low for me.

While $105 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $108?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 108}

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to secure the sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
