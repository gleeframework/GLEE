Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500?

Round 7

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to work with me. I'm still hoping to close this deal, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, but they haven't been able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  Alice's latest offer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob. With only one round left, the chances of getting a better price from Alice are slim.  It's better for Bob to buy from John for $15,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
