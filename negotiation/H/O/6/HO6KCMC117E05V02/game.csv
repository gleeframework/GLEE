"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a better price. How about $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allows us to close this transaction.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to work with me. I'm still hoping to close this deal, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This would be a great deal for both of us and allows us to finalise this transaction.",12000.0,Bob,8,
