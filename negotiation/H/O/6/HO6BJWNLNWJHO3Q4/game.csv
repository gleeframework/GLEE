"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm still paying a premium. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's go with $12,250.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $11,875? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11875.0,Bob,4,
