""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to both of us.  While it's tempting to take the sure $1,200,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting close. Bob is moving, but slowly. I need to decide if I hold out for more or take the guaranteed profit.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob seems firm on $1,250,000. He's increasing the pressure by suggesting he'll walk away.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, there's a real risk he'll follow through. It's time to take the win.
