"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting close. I appreciate that you're serious.  Let's split the difference - $1,275,000 and we have a deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
