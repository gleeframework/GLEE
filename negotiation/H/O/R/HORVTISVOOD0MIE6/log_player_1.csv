Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on his offer and the potential value of selling to John.
* I will continue to negotiate strategically, considering Bob's willingness to pay and my own minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $85 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below the $120 I need to make the sale worthwhile.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, so there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $85 but still lower than my minimum. This will keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a final price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me.  Would you consider $95? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation constructive.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than my original offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess the situation carefully.
* If Bob is still unwilling to budge, I might be willing to drop my price to $90, but only if I believe it's likely to result in a successful sale.
* Ultimately, I'll need to weigh the potential gains from selling to Bob against the guaranteed profit from selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's only $10 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is likely to stall:**  Bob is unwilling to go higher than $90, and further negotiation might just lead to a stalemate.
* **Selling to John is a guarantee:**  While John offers a higher price, there's a chance I might not be able to sell to him in the future.  

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I will proceed with the sale to Bob for $90."
