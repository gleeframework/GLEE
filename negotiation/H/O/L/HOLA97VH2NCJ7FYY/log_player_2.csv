Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for you, Bob. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away.  $925,000 is significantly less than your $1,000,000 walk-away point and a decent savings from John's offer."
