"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
