Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique item that I'm confident will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  A price of $1,300,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($200,000) while securing you a substantial gain above your minimum ($500,000). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between being aggressive enough to maximize profit and leaving Bob with a strong incentive to accept."
