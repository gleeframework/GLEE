Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but not at such a low price point.  We'll reject and counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me. To be frank, we need to see a significant move on price for this to work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal, but I need you to meet me closer to that figure."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product for this price elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob has revealed his maximum price and it's far too low. It's unlikely he'll move substantially from here. Accepting his offer would lose us a significant amount of money.  Therefore, it's time to cut our losses and sell to John for our guaranteed price."
