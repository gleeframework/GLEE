"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me. To be frank, we need to see a significant move on price for this to work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal, but I need you to meet me closer to that figure.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product for this price elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,6,
