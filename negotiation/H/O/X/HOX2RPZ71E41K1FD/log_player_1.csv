Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to the value of the product to me. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round.  The goal is to get as close to my minimum price ($120) as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick closer to the value of the product to me. I propose a price of $112 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112 is close to my minimum price of $120, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to give Bob another chance to come closer to my expectations. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $113? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets this deal done. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 113}
