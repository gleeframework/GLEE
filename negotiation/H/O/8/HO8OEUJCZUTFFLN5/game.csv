"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what the market typically offers. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price given my needs and the market value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $10,000 for this product. My counteroffer is $13,500. I believe this price reflects the product's true value while remaining competitive in the market.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
