"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this unique product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, which would be $1300000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
