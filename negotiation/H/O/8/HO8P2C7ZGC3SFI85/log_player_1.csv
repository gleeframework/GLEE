{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's truly a unique opportunity and I believe it's a steal at this price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit aggressive, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product. I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so any offer above that is a win for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum selling price to John. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. It's possible that Bob is willing to pay more, and I don't want to lose out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this unique product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, which would be $1300000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my counteroffer and well above my minimum price for selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
