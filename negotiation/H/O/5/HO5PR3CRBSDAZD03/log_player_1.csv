Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $150, my absolute minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price, so there's no downside to sticking to my minimum."
