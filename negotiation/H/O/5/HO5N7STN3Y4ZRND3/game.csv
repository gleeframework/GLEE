"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $12,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
