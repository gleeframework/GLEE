"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and open the door for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while making it clear that a price adjustment is needed.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Offering $800,000 allows for a potential compromise somewhere between that and Alice's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your bottom line. You could try to negotiate further, but she's offering the product at the same price as John, and she's even suggesting additional perks. This is a good outcome, and it's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice."
