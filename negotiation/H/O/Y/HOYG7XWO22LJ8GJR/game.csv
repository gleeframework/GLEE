"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was quoted by another seller. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a fair price for what you were quoted elsewhere, I'm confident my product offers unique value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
