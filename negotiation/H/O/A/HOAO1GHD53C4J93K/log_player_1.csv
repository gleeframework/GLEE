"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Showing confidence:**  I'm confident in the product's value and my negotiating skills.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm aware Bob may not accept this price right away, but it sets the stage for a productive back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still a good amount of space between my desired price and Bob's offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **No rush to sell:**  With ten rounds, I have time to explore other options without being pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? That's still a great deal for you, and I can live with that price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to work with Bob while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not going to accept his initial offer, but I'm open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is just $250 away from my counteroffer, and getting $9,000 is a great result. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away or his price might go even lower.
* **Time is ticking:** I've already rejected one counteroffer, and it's important to secure a deal before running out of rounds."
