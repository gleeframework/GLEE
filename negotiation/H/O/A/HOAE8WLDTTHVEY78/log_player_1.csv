Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. This product is useful to me, but not at that price point.  How about we start around $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and a solid backup option with John.  We need to signal that we're serious about the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I sense we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's true worth. How about we consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're dropping our price significantly, signaling flexibility, but holding firm at our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Putting our bottom line on the table now adds pressure for Bob to respond seriously.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, having John's offer in our back pocket gives us confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet our valuation."
