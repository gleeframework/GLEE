Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $10,000 
* **John's price:** $15,000

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can offer Bob a price slightly lower than that, but still higher than his maximum. This gives me a good chance of closing the deal with Bob while still getting a decent price for the product. 

**Important Note:** This strategy works under the assumption that Bob is the only other potential buyer with a known value. If there are other buyers, the strategy might change depending on their value and willingness to pay."
