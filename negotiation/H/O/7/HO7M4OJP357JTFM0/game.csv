"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this unique product. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $110 for it. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
