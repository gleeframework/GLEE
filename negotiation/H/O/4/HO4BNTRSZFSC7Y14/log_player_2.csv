"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by trying to negotiate a better price. $7,500 is a significant savings from $15,000, but you can likely get a lower price by rejecting the offer and counteroffering.  There's no reason to buy from John right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to be aggressive in the early stages."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good price, it's still closer to Alice's initial offer than my counteroffer. I want to keep pushing for a lower price and see if I can get Alice to come closer to my desired price range. I'm willing to continue negotiating, given that I have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired range. I believe this counteroffer is fair and could potentially be accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we still have several rounds left, I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still firm on my desire to get a price closer to $6,000.  I'm hoping that with only 4 rounds remaining, Alice will feel pressured to accept a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $100 away from my last counteroffer.  With only 3 rounds left, it's time to start locking in a deal.  While I'd prefer to get it for $6,000,  $6,100 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely that Alice will come down further, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate."
