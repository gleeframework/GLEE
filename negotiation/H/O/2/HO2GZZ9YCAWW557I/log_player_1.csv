Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum target, it's still below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push him closer to my desired price point.  I believe we can reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
