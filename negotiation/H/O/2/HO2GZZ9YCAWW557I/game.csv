,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This reflects a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  I believe it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
