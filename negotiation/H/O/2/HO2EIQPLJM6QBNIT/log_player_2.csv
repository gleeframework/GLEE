"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is truly valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I can't disclose the specific details just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident that its value to you could be even greater. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a significant price reduction considering its true value, and I'm hoping you'll see the potential it holds. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Since Alice thinks it's worth at least $800,000 to her, I'll try to negotiate or at least see if she's willing to lower the price. I'll reject her offer for now and see if she's willing to make a better deal.
