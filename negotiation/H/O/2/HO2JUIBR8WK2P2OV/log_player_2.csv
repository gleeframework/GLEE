"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same price as John's.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer means he can potentially negotiate with Alice to get a lower price or explore other options. Buying from John immediately doesn't provide any opportunity for negotiation or finding a better deal."
