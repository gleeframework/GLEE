"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice or just buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $850,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 more than Bob's maximum budget. It's a reasonable compromise considering that Bob could still buy from John for $800,000.  By accepting, Bob gets the product and avoids further negotiation."
