Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You're aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Aiming high, but staying reasonable:** Offering it for $10,500 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential for a higher profit margin makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
