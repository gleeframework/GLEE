Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10000 is simply too low for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which still allows me to make a fair profit.  This is a significant offer considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
