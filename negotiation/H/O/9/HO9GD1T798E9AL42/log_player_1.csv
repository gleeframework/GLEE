{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Using positive language (""fantastic"", ""great asset"") helps build rapport and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly acknowledging that negotiation is possible (""Let me know what you think!"").

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  Bob's offer is at my minimum price, which means I'm not making any profit.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial $15,000.
* **Not a Huge Risk:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most profitable.  The risk of rejecting Bob's offer is minimal as I can always fall back on selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000.  I'll explain that I'm willing to negotiate but need to make a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which still allows me to make a fair profit.  This is a significant offer considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Budget:** Showing understanding of Bob's budget makes the negotiation more collaborative.
* **Firm but Fair Counteroffer:** $12,500 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a profit.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $11,250 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, allowing me to make a decent profit. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob explicitly states this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation might be futile. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Close:** I'll accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on to my next business opportunity."
