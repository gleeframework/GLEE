"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above your minimum, but still leaves room for potential bargaining.  It's important to be polite and set a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While it's tempting to accept, rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going. You can try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, how about $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down from your original price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Since John is also willing to buy for $80, accepting Bob's offer ensures you get your minimum price and close the deal in this round."
