"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is getting closer to what I can do, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and benefits.",11250.0,Alice,5,
