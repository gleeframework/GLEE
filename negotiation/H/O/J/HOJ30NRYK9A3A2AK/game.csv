"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? I'm happy to chat more about it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the value I think the product holds. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering your initial offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $102. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
