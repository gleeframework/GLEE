Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a starting point of $950,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $700,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
