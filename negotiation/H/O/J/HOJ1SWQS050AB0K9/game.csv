"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a starting point of $950,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering a new price of $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
