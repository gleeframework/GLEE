"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium on my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to engage and counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a favorable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and hopefully appealing enough to keep Bob engaged. It shows flexibility while maintaining a reasonable margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but getting closer.  I'm not ready to accept yet, but I'm seeing a pattern of increasing offers, so I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's increased offer while still protecting my minimum value. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob into accepting, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I would have liked to secure a higher price, given the time constraint and the fact that John is also offering the same amount, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
