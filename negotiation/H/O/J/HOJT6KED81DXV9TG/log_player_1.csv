Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping for a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. However, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a prolonged process and I might not reach a satisfactory price.  John's offer of $10,000 is a sure deal, and I'm willing to take that to avoid further negotiation."
