# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's potential to get it even lower. Since you have a backup option with John, you can use this to your advantage by negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's important to start low to leave room for compromise while still remaining within your budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $800,000.  This feels like a good middle ground for us both."", ""product_price"": 800000}
