"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $715,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
