Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $95. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at $95, the deal is good enough to take.  There's no guarantee I could get it for $90, and it's not worth risking paying John $100."
