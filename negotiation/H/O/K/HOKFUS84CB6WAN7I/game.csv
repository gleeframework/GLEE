"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $95. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",95.0,Alice,5,
