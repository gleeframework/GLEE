Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $100 would be a fair price for the product. Would you be able to meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $100, which is the very minimum I'd accept. There's little point in further negotiation. Accepting his offer nets me the minimum acceptable profit. I can achieve the same by selling to John without the hassle of further haggling."
