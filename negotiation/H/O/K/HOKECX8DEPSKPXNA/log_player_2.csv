# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own stated value. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer of $8,000."
