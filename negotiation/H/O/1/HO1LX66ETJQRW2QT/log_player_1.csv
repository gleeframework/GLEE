Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Risk assessment:**  While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price outweighs the risk of going straight to John."
