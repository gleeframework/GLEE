"Alice, that starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be a bit more reasonable. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but we're quite far apart. Let's try something more realistic. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but that price is still too high for me.  To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 simply won't work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
