"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly higher price than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value"" to justify the high initial price.  
* **Strategic Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit. By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob counters significantly lower, it's likely the final price will be above his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides me with a strong fallback position. I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be a bit more reasonable. How about we start the conversation at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Early Stage:** It's still very early in the negotiation. Rejecting this low offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to walk away from unfavorable deals.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, I can begin steering the negotiation towards a more acceptable range. 

I will use the next round to make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but shows some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but we're quite far apart. Let's try something more realistic. How about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Above Minimum:** I've dropped my price substantially from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but keeps me well above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Justification:**  I haven't provided a specific reason for the high price. This keeps the focus on the negotiation itself.  
* **Targeting Zone:** This counteroffer aims to bring the negotiation closer to a potential agreement zone. It encourages Bob to increase his offer significantly while leaving me room for further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but that price is still too high for me.  To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 simply won't work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a profit.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has essentially revealed his maximum price by stating anything above $1,000,000 won't work. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away or the negotiation could drag on. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potential lost opportunities."
