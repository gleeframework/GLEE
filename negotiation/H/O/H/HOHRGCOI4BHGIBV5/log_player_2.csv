"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it offers you, and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further to close the deal."
