Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This approach allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately rejecting Bob.
* **Protecting my interests:**  I'm still significantly above my minimum value, giving me flexibility to consider John's offer if Bob doesn't come close enough.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value:** $850,000 is too low for me to accept.
* **I have a strong backup option:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000, giving me a secure alternative. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round. 

I'm willing to risk a little more negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it offers you, and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Value proposition:**  I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob, further justifying the price. 
* **Focus on a win-win:** I highlight the potential for both of us to be happy with the deal.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping my options open for either accepting a slightly higher offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $875,000. This reflects the value to me, and hopefully, it allows us both to come to a satisfying conclusion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not enough:**  While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continued negotiation might lead to further price concessions, potentially resulting in a sale below my minimum.
* **Secure alternative:** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a guaranteed sale at my desired value.

Given the risk of continued negotiation and the availability of a secure alternative, I've decided to sell to John to guarantee my minimum desired profit."
