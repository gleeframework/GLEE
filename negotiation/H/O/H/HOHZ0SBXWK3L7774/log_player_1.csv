I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that is above my minimum value of $80 and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than John's offer of $80 and is closer to my ideal price. Accepting this offer would be the best choice for maximizing my earnings."
