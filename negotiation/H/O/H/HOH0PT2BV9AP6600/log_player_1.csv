Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could offer it at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price point that's likely to be tempting to Bob (as it's significantly above his $80 valuation) while still netting you a good profit.
* **Simple and Direct:**  The message is clear and avoids unnecessary complexity."
