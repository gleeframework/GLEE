,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500, but I think we can do better than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot in between.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $12200, but no more. Can you meet me there?",12200.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12200. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where I should consider other options. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $12800, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise at $14000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
