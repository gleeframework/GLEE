"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the unique advantages it offers you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference for me. I'm willing to accept $980,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think you're being a bit too optimistic about the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",960000.0,Bob,6,
