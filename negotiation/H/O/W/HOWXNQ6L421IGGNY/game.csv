"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $9000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This is a fair price that gives you a significant discount and allows me to meet my minimum. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. How about we try $8500? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about $8500, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to $9000. How about $8750? This is a fair middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet my budget. How about we try $8000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,8,
