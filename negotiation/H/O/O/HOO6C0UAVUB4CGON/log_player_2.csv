"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and she's asking for $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This gives you leverage, but you want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:**  By offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for further discussion.
* **Targeting the middle ground:** This offer is halfway between your desired price of $1,200,000 and Alice's minimum value of $800,000. It shows you're taking her interests into account while still aiming for a favorable deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While this is a bold counteroffer, it leaves space for Alice to propose a price closer to your desired range in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.** Her offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay right now. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, and there's potential to get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  However, you're getting closer to a potentially better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. It's a smaller jump from your previous offer, signaling a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Staying within your range:**  $750,000 is still well within your budget and is closer to Alice's minimum value. This increases the likelihood of her accepting your offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You still have 6 rounds left, and if Alice rejects this offer, you can continue to raise your counteroffer incrementally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** Alice's offer is now very close to your target price range. You're only $20,000 away from your ideal price.
* **Time is ticking:**  You only have 5 rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee that you'll get a better offer in the next few rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers and the deal falling through. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
