Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer and providing your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a respectable figure, it falls a bit short of what I had in mind. In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both parties involved."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, closer to your value and within my budget. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth risking another round to see if Bob will budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.  While I acknowledge your offer, I'm still seeking a price point closer to my initial valuation.  Therefore, I propose a price of $1,090,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,090,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now anchored himself at $1,075,000 and signaled that he may walk away if I don't accept.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's becoming increasingly risky. Bob is unlikely to meet my desired price, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for significantly more. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the profitable deal with John."
