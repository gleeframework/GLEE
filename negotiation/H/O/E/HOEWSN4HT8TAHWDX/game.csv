"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer and providing your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a respectable figure, it falls a bit short of what I had in mind. In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both parties involved.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, closer to your value and within my budget. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.  While I acknowledge your offer, I'm still seeking a price point closer to my initial valuation.  Therefore, I propose a price of $1,090,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,090,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
