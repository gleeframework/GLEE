"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to compromise a bit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $6,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm only halfway through the negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000, as I think there's still potential to earn more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm going to counter with $7,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and hopefully encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I'm only halfway through the negotiation and I'm still hoping to secure a better deal.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000, as I think there's still potential to earn more with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm going to counter with $7,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to find a compromise while remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  We're approaching the later rounds, so I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $6,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I'm only two rounds away from selling to John, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 6900}
```

I'm going to counter with $6,900. This is a small concession from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it's enough to persuade Bob to close the deal. We're almost out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best I can do given the circumstances."
