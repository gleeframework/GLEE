Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $15,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $15,500.  While closer to your $10,000 goal, you have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut your losses in this negotiation and secure the product at your target price."
