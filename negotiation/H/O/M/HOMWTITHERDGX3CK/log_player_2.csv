"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. This product would be really useful, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This gives us room to move up while aiming for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Justified:** The message is polite and provides a reason for the counteroffer (""tight budget""), making it more likely Alice will engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, $13,000 is still significantly higher than both your target price and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer or settling at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not dramatically. The $9,500 counteroffer keeps us below our $10,000 maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Suggesting we ""meet in the middle"" encourages compromise and suggests a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a reasonable price. How about $11,500? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm above your $10,000 limit.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's $10,000 offer.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
