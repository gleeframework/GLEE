"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. This product would be really useful, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a reasonable price. How about $11,500? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
