"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm really hoping to make this work, so let's see if we can find a price that's fair for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
