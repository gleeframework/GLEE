"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation to give me some room to negotiate. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, so Bob won't feel like he's stuck with a take-it-or-leave-it offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I will reject it and see if I can get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm really hoping to make this work, so let's see if we can find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price, so I'll accept it.  It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to close the sale."
