"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm confident it'll be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you considering my budget. I'm happy to pay $14,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $14,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $15,250? That's closer to my target, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that deal.",15250.0,Bob,4,
