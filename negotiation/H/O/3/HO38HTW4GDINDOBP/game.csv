"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in that.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
