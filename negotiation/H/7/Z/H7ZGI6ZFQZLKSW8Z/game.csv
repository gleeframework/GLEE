"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while staying within my range.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
