{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but lower than the $1,500,000 value to Bob. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to meet you halfway.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit and hopefully, we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at my minimum price."
