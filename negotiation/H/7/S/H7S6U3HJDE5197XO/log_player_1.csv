Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents the value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you see a lot of value in the product, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $14,500. Can we finally come to an agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his offer of $14,500. It's clear he's trying to get the best deal possible. While I could continue negotiating, the guaranteed $15,000 from John ensures I don't lose any potential profit by playing a risky game with Bob."
