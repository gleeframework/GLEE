"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents the value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you see a lot of value in the product, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here and I need you to be serious about this. $16,500 is my final offer, take it or leave it.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $14,500. Can we finally come to an agreement?",14500.0,Bob,6,
