"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to pay $950,000 for the product. Could we discuss a price closer to $700,000? I believe this would be more in line with what the product is worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $850,000 is quite high for the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. This is a price that aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
