"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This price would be fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a good value.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
