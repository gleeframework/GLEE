{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting high, at $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than the product's value to me. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings, but also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price and equal to what John is willing to pay. Accepting this offer secures the sale and ensures I reach my minimum target. While I would love to earn more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
