"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating,  $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering a price of $16,500. This is still a considerable markup from my minimum value, but it's a step closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to sell for $14,500 yet. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering $15,500.  This is a compromise, halfway between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is finally at my minimum value. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him. While I was hoping to earn more, I'm happy to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
