Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe this strategy maximizes my chances of earning the most money possible.  Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I am not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. While I need to be mindful of the potential of selling to John, I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  However, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds now, and I'm concerned that we may not be able to reach a higher price with Bob.  To avoid further delays and potential losses, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
