Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $120, but it also leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher price if Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to try and get a higher price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? That way we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 125}
