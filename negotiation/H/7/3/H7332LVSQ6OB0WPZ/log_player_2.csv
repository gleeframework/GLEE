"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is only worth $100 to Alice, there's a chance we can get it for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows us to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about I sell it to you for $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price.  We're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice's offer is now only $8 more than what the product is worth to her. This is a good compromise and a fair price.  Accepting the offer means we save $12 compared to buying from John."
