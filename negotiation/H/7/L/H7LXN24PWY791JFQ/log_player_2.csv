Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500, considering the value it holds for you. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's see if we can meet at $13,750.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $13,375. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,375

It's getting too risky to keep negotiating. Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $13,250. While I could try for a lower price, there's a good chance she won't budge and I'll end up paying John's $15,000 price anyway. Accepting the $13,375 is a reasonable compromise to ensure I get the product without overpaying."
