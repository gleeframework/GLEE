"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the value you place on the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
