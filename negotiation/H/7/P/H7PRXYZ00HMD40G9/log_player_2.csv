Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the value you place on the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Although Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of ending up with a price higher than John's guaranteed offer. It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
