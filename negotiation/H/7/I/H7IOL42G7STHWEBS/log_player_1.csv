{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This initial offer starts the negotiation by aiming high. It's reasonable, considering the product's value to Bob, but also leaves room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $950000? I hope this proposal is more within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe we can still get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $1000000 would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a fair price, considering my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
