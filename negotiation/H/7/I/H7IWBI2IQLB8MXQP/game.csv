"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While it looks like a great product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Would that be something you'd be comfortable with?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $110?  That's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to go down to $110, Bob. But I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying my best to reach a fair deal here.  $125 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $115?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite willing to go down to $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $128? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this product.",128.0,Alice,7,
