"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before reaching your maximum budget or approaching a price Alice would likely accept."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. How about $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Aiming for Value:** You are aiming for a price that represents significant savings for you while still being potentially attractive to Alice (who values the product at $800,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, it's still too high. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""I understand this is a valuable product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise by splitting the difference between your previous offer ($600,000) and Alice's current offer ($850,000).
* **Fairness:** By proposing a middle ground, you signal to Alice that you are willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Still Below Budget:**  The offer keeps you well below your maximum budget and leaves open the possibility for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit below where I need to be.  How about $775,000? That's a fair middle ground, and it allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, there's still room to negotiate.  A difference of $50,000 is significant.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** John's standing offer of $1,000,000 acts as leverage. You're willing to walk away from the negotiation with Alice if she doesn't come down further, as John's offer is becoming increasingly appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  My final offer is $750,000.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer clearly signals that it is your final offer. This adds weight to the negotiation and encourages Alice to seriously consider it.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):** You're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($775,000) and your previous counteroffer ($725,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Alternative Option:**  By implying that you might walk away if this offer isn't accepted, you add pressure without being confrontational. You want Alice to understand that your alternative (John's offer) is becoming increasingly attractive."
