"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant $800000 to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with an offer of $900000, reflecting the value and potential of this product. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is below my desired price point, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, reflecting the value of the product and acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's work together to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it is still above his desired price point.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and secure a lower price.  John is always an option, but Bob is still motivated to potentially save some money by continuing the negotiation."
