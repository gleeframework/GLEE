Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
