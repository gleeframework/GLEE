Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  The message emphasizes the potential profit for Bob, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not a ""take it or leave it"" situation. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the product for a significantly lower price. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I create a dynamic where Bob has the incentive to counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. If negotiations stall, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my desired value.** While it's closer to my goal than his initial offer, it's still $100,000 less than what I want.
* **I have a strong backup option in John.** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more enticing to him. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to hold out for a better price. While Bob's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I have a guaranteed alternative in John, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's finalize this and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Maintain Value:**  $925,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, ensuring I'm not giving away too much value.
* **Enthusiasm:** The message conveys a sense of eagerness to finalize the deal, making Bob feel valued.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that makes both of us feel like we got a good deal. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still maintaining my desired price range. I'm confident this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $915000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** While $915,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still $85,000 below my target.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. Bob's repeated counteroffers suggest he might not be willing to go higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $1,000,000. This is a risk-free option that ensures I get the best possible outcome.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob might not yield a significantly better result. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate. While I'm always open to a good deal, this situation favors a guaranteed outcome."
