"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, we're willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer.  Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  We maintain a friendly tone and acknowledge the product's value, but clearly state our budget constraints.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is low enough to gauge Alice's flexibility but not so low as to be insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To better accommodate you, I would like to propose an offer of $75 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while providing you with a valuable item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $75 is closer to our target, we're still above our fallback option of buying from John for $80. There's room for further negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge Alice a bit closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $68? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise, which can be persuasive. 
* **Specific Price:**  We're moving away from broad ranges and aiming for a more concrete figure.
* **Justification:**  We're subtly implying that this price is the most we're willing to go. 
* **Still Below John:** We're still aiming for a price lower than John's offer."
