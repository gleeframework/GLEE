"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 was a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
