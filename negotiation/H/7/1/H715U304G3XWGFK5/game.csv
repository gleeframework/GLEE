"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to consider my budget. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $900000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $950000? That's as high as I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I still think $950000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is my final offer before I start considering other options, but I'm still open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counteroffer at $987500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",987500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
