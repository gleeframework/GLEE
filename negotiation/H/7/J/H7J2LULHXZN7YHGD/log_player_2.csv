I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Bob can save $150,000 by going with John."
