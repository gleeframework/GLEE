"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it would be perfect for you.  My price is $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $115. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a good starting point to see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great value for the product and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still above my minimum of $120 but it shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully motivates Bob to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I really appreciate it. Can you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $105 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you on this. Let's split the difference. How about $107.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly to $107.50. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still have a strong sense of value for the product.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. I'd like to propose $106 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $106 is getting very close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for just a bit more in the next round.  I'm not sure how much more negotiating room I have with Bob, so this may be my last chance before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go to $108 for this product. This is my final offer. I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```

I'm going to try one last time to get closer to my desired price. $108 is only slightly above Bob's offer and might be a good compromise. If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I would like to counter with $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not sure Bob is going to budge further, and I'm getting close to the end of my negotiation rounds.  I'm going to sell to John for $120.  This is above my minimum and I'll have a guaranteed sale."
