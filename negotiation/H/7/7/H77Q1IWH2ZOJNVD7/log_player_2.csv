Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now very close to your last counteroffer and well within your budget. 
* Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away is increasing.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for losing the deal completely."
