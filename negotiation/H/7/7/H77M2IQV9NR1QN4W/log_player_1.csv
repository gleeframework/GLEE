"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, it gives me room to negotiate downwards in subsequent rounds without appearing too eager."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. I'm confident I can get a slightly higher price by counter-offering in the next round.  This strategy gives me the chance to potentially gain an extra $500 without risking losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500.  This is a reasonable compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll still have room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum of $8,000, and it's only a small amount less than my last counteroffer.  Accepting this offer will ensure I get a good price while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
