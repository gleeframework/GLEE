"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to budge. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $9,000 price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still making a profit. 
* **Positive and friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone will encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to improve the price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired range. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I think it's a fair offer for you as well."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us. 
* **Staying firm on my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop below $8,000 (which is still above my minimum of $10,000).
* **Keeping it friendly:**  I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $8,500. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I really like the product and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** $8,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on this deal and then having to start over with another potential buyer.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting Bob's offer could lead to future opportunities if he's happy with the product.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $8,000 is a good outcome given the circumstances."
