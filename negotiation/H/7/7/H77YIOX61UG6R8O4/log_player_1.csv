Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""value and potential"" are subtle ways to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation. This leaves room to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.

By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit."
