"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. How about $1,350,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
