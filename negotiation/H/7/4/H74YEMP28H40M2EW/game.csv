"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value the product holds for me. While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get a price closer to $850000. This would still give you a good profit while allowing me a better deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the profit I'll make. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900000. It seems like we're both willing to compromise, so let's try to bridge the gap.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $925000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I'll make. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
