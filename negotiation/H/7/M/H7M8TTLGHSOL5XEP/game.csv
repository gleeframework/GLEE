"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $1,125,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $1,950,000.  This offer represents a substantial discount and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That price is closer, but still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,350,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product and is my best offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a good product and I know you value it highly, but I have a firm budget. My last offer is $1,450,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
