Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you don't want to sell for less than that.
* **Negotiation room:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Psychological pricing:** Offering a price slightly below a round number ($150) can make it seem more appealing. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
