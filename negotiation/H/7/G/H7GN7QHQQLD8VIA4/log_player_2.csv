Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. 

{""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $700,000 is a substantial undervaluation. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to that price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is the closest I can get to the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your understanding, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a living, so I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
