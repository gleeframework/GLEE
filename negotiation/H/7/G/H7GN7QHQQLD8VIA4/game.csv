"Bob, I understand your position on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $700,000 is a substantial undervaluation. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a living, so I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,4,
