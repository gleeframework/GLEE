"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a chance to make some profit.  Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. It's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, our previous discussions, and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a great compromise for both of us.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal now.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
