"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a chance to make some profit.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his limit.  Bob should continue negotiating, aiming to get the price closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. It's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but $9,750 is still above his $8,000 limit.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice down further. There's still room for compromise, and Bob should aim for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, our previous discussions, and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a great compromise for both of us.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal now.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. There are only three rounds left.  While there's a chance Bob could get Alice to agree to his desired price, it's risky.  It's more likely that the price will remain above his budget, and he'll be forced to pay more than he wants.  

Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, the best option is to take the guaranteed lower price.  He'll save money and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
