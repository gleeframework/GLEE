"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate its features. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to reach Bob's goal."
