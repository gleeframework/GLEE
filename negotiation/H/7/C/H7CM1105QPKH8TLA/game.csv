"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $800,000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. Let's try $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $625,000, which would be $687,500. What do you think?",687500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're getting closer, Alice. I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to show I'm serious. How about $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a genuine effort to reach a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, which is a bit above your last offer. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,7,
