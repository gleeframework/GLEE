Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're making a genuine effort to reach a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, which is a bit above your last offer. What do you think?

Alice is clearly committed to meeting in the middle and making concessions. At $675,000, we're getting a significant discount from both her original offer and John's price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better result, and it risks pushing Alice away."
