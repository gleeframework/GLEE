"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Target in Mind:** While the initial offer is $80, remember your goal is to pay less than $100. This leaves space to potentially meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** Alice's offer of $95 is now below your $100 maximum budget.
* **Good Deal:**  While you could try to negotiate further, $95 is a reasonable price and saves you $5 compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has a risk that Alice might increase her price or you might reach an impasse. Accepting now secures a good deal."
