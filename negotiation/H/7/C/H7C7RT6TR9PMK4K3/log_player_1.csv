"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This allows for room for negotiation and hopefully leaves some profit for me while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings, but we'll need to adjust based on Bob's response and how many rounds we have left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000 and doesn't leave much room for profit. I will reject this offer and attempt to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate while also being significantly higher than his last offer. I'm hoping this will strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to receive. I have more rounds available, and there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,000.  This is still above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  Since we are halfway through the rounds and still haven't reached an agreement, it's important to be flexible to avoid losing out to John's offer."
