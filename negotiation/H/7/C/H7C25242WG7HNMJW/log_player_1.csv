Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close a deal, I am willing to risk going to the next round and making a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $13,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $11,500 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price. While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
