"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure this product is unique, but I'm only willing to go up to $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $16000 is a more reasonable compromise. It's still a great price for this unique product, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again. $16000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. This is my final offer. What do you say?",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing other options. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
