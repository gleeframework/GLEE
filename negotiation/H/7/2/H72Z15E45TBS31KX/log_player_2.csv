"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm aiming for a price closer to $80, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product at $95? This still allows us to cover our costs while being more flexible to your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to save more. It's worth seeing if I can push her down further, especially since I can always fall back on buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $87.50? It's a fair price that keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
