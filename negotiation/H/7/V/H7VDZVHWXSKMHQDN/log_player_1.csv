Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $80 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself. I'll offer the product to Bob for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $85, which is a bit higher than his previous offer, but still lower than the original price I wanted.
