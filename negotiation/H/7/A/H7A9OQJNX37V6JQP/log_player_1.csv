Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal selling price ($12,000) than my minimum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $11,500, I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than $10,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to try and get closer to my ideal selling price of $12,000, so I'll counter Bob's offer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  How about $11,000? It's still a great price for a product worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $11,500 to $11,000. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $11,000 is still a good price considering its worth to him.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** While $11,000 isn't my ideal price, it still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. How about $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price ($10,500).
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further might lead to a higher price, but it also risks prolonging the process. There's a chance Bob might walk away or I might get a better offer from John in the meantime.
* **Limited Upside:** The potential upside from further negotiation is small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
