Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still significantly below my valuation. I have room to negotiate and will try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls short of my expectations for this product. Its true value significantly surpasses your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,875,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,750,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to hold out a bit longer. I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is very close to what I had in mind.  To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm prepared to accept $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution, Alice. I am willing to consider your last offer of $1,800,000, but I need time to review my financial situation. In the meantime, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,775,000. I hope this is within the range you are willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,775,000 makes the most sense at this point. It's significantly higher than John's offer and further haggling might not yield a better result. It's time to close the deal."
