Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 puts it significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You earn a profit of $150,000 over your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  You can still sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
