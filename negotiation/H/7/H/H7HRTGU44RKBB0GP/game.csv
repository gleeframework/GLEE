"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it looks great, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $90? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
