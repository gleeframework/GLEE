Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price significantly better than John's offer of $100.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
