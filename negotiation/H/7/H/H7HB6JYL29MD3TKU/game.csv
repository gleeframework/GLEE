"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,11000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price that balances our interests, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9800.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
