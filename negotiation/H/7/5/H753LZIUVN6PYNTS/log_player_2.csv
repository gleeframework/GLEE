"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time, and I know it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000, a price that reflects its true worth. This is a chance to gain a considerable advantage in your market. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $1,250,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, rejecting her offer will allow you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John. 
* There's a chance that by rejecting Alice's offer, you can motivate her to lower her price or that John might be willing to negotiate a better price if he knows you have another option."
