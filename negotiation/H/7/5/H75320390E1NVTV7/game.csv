"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to sell. I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer. I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $135? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - how about $130? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. How about we meet at $132.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",132.5,Alice,5,
