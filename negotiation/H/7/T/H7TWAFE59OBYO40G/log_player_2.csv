Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I've already compromised significantly by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best price you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $920,000, a saving of $280,000 from Alice's initial offer and $580,000 from John's price.
* **Alice's Firm Stance:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate, and you could risk losing the deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  While you have rounds remaining, securing a good price now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While you *might* be able to get the price a little lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price isn't worth it at this point."
