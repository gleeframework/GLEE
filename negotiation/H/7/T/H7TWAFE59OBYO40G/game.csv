"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly better price. Would you be open to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I've already compromised significantly by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best price you'll get.",920000.0,Alice,5,
