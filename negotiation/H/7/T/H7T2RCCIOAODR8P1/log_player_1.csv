I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $15,000, so there's no risk for me in asking for more. 

By offering a higher price, I hope to capitalize on any potential value Bob may see in the product, leading to a better outcome for me."
