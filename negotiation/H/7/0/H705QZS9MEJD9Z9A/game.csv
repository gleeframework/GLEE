I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and dedicated support. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, but I need you to agree to these additional terms.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the wire, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000.

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000, with the additional warranty and support. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
