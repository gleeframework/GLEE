"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product extends far beyond its immediate utility to you. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price.  He's already made it clear that $850,000 is his max."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand this product's true worth.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. If you meet me halfway between our last two offers, we have an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget. At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go lower.  Buying from John is the best option for Bob, as he'll save $200,000.  While he might have been able to squeeze out a lower price from Alice, the risk of her rejecting the offer and losing time is too great."
