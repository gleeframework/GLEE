"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value,""  we are subtly anchoring the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer is high but not outrageously so. It allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob that might still land within a range acceptable to us.
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer is above his perceived value of the product, indicating there's room for negotiation. We are aiming for a much higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the security of John's offer at $1,000,000. Accepting $850,000 now would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.
* **Early Stages:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that we are serious about getting a better price. 

We'll proceed to the next round and provide a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product extends far beyond its immediate utility to you. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We are making a significant drop from our initial offer ($150,000),  showing Bob we are willing to negotiate. However, the new price is still substantially higher than both his offer and his perceived value.
* **Reiterating Value:** We are subtly reminding Bob of the product's broader worth, hinting that it might be valuable to others beyond just him.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is and help us understand the potential range for agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is holding firm at $850,000, signaling that this might be his ceiling. 
* **Value Disparity:**  The gap between his offer and our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) is still significant.
* **John as Leverage:**  We have the safety net of John's offer, giving us room to push Bob a bit further. 

Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand this product's true worth.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. If you meet me halfway between our last two offers, we have an agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We are making it clear this is our final offer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting a price exactly between our last offer ($1,150,000) and his ($850,000), we are proposing a seemingly ""fair"" compromise.
* **Non-Negotiable Minimum:** This offer brings the price to our absolute minimum ($1,000,000). We are prepared to walk away if Bob rejects this. 
* **John as Backup:**  If Bob rejects this final offer, we will accept John's offer in the next round."
