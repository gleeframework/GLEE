"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is well above my budget.  Given the value I see in your product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that number.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering both our needs and the potential value of this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, that price point undervalues what the product brings.  My final offer is $1,500,000. This is my walk-away point -  if it doesn't work, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
