Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $120. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a profit.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and open to negotiation.  It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and invites him to discuss the price. 

This initial offer sets the stage for potential counteroffers and gives me the opportunity to maximize my earnings while still considering the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I need to hold firm and try to push for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob through continued negotiation, or by selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport by thanking Bob and expressing appreciation for his interest.  I highlight the potential value for him and maintain a friendly tone, hoping to encourage acceptance.

I believe $100 is a good middle ground, potentially appealing to Bob while still exceeding my minimum price requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm eager to sell the product, Bob's offer of $85 is simply too low. It falls well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm not willing to compromise any further.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a fair profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
