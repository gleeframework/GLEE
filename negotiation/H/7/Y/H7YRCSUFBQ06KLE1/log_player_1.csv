Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12900} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final counteroffer at $12,900. This is a small concession, but I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to consider selling to John in the final round."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's final offer is very close to my minimum. There's no guarantee that he'll accept my counteroffer in this last round, and risking a rejection would mean I get less than John's offer. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at this point than to risk getting nothing."
