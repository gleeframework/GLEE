"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for what it can do for your business.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for a negotiation and gives me room to bargain. It's also important to add a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for more.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little high for that price. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm feeling confident that Bob is a serious buyer, and we're close to a deal. $950,000 is significantly higher than what John is offering, and it's within my acceptable range.  It's time to close this deal."
