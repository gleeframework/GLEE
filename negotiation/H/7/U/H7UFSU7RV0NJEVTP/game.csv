"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a bit too rich for my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1050000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but I really think that's as high as I can go. I'd love to find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
