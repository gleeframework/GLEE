"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  While Bob's maximum is $12,000, Alice is offering the product for $11,500. This means Bob saves $500 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a fair deal for Alice.** Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, but she's getting $1,500 more than that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it allows him to save money while still obtaining the product."
