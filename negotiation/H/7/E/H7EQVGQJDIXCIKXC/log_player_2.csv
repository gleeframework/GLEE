"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still more than you'd like to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $9,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a decent amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit higher than her initial offer. It is still more than I want to pay, and I have 7 rounds left to negotiate. I'm going to reject and try to get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my ideal range.  Since Alice rejected my last offer, I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount this time, hoping to find a price that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is again higher than the previous round. While it's tempting to accept as we are nearing the middle of our rounds, it's still too high for my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her to come down further.  With 5 rounds left, there's still time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8850} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to raise her offer, but I'm still determined to get a better deal.  I'm increasing my offer again to $8,850. This is still a significant discount from her current offer of $9,350, and it demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her price, and we are down to our last few rounds. I'm not confident I can get her down to my desired price within the remaining rounds. It's better to buy from John at $10,000 than to risk losing the opportunity to get the product at all."
