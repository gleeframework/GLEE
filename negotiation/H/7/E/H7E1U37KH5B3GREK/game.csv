"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
