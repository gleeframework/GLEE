Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""quality"" of the product, you're subtly justifying the higher price, even though Bob values it at $120. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob to counter-offer if he wants to.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always lower the price slightly or move directly to selling to John for your guaranteed $120."
