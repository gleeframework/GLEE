Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and hopefully, Bob sees some value in it as well.  I'm ready to negotiate if necessary, but I won't settle for anything less than $1,000,000 as I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I want to get the best price possible, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still a respectable price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is fair and could be appealing to Bob,  while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold.  While I would prefer more, it's a good profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. I'm willing to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
