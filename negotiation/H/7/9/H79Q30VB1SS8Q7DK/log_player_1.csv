Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing for more in later rounds."
