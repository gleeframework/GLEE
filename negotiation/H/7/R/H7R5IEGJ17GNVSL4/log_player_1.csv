Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  getting a higher price from Bob is preferable.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, and we value it at a minimum of $1,500,000.  A price of $1,350,000 splits the difference and leaves room for Bob to perceive value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
