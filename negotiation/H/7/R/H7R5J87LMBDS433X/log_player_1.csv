Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The negotiable range is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out completely. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in it.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Implied:** By not mentioning John, you subtly imply scarcity and that you have other options if Bob declines.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $1,400,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to come down slightly, potentially settling somewhere between $1,200,001 and $1,399,999.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,500,000."
