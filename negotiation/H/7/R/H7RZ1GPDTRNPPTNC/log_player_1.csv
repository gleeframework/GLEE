Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating ""value"" can be vague, suggesting a fair price implies you've put thought into it.  
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?""  invites Bob to counter-offer, starting a dialogue. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly. However, starting high gives you the most leverage.
* **Market context:**  If similar products are selling for significantly less than $1,500,000, you'll need to be prepared to justify your price."
