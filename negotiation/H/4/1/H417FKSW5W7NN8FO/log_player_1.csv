{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I'd rather close the deal than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
