"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
