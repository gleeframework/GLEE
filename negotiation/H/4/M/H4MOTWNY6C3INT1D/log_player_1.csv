"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential value to Bob. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I am leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I am being unreasonable. 

This is just the first round, and I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.  I will be willing to lower the price if needed, but I will always be mindful of my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to close the deal, Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling to John would be a better option at this point. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** However, I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point. I will be mindful of the remaining rounds and my fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while also making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and remaining open to negotiation.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm reframing the negotiation by focusing on a ""fair price"" rather than simply a ""lower price.""

**Strategy:**

* **Remaining rounds:** With 7 rounds remaining, I'm still hopeful of reaching a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired price.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to adjust my counteroffers as needed in subsequent rounds, taking into account Bob's responses and the remaining rounds.
* **John as a safety net:** I'll continue to keep John's offer as a safety net if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a lower price. How about $1,075,000?  This seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's closer, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I still believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially with more rounds remaining.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum.  I will continue to be flexible and adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds.  I'm aiming to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial while ensuring I get a price that is fair to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're aiming for a lower price, and I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I'm focusing on the positive aspects of accepting the offer, emphasizing that it's a ""fair compromise"" that allows both parties to be satisfied.
* **Urgency and closing:**  I'm using language like ""Let's close this deal"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Remaining rounds:**  With 5 rounds left, I'm putting pressure on Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still willing to adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds if necessary. However, I'm becoming more firm in my negotiation as time goes on.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
