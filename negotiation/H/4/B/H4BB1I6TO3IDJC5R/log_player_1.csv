"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we talk about $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is equal to the price John is willing to pay. While I would ideally prefer to get a higher price, it's a fair offer and secures me the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's also important to consider the possibility that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away."
