"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from the true value I believe it holds for you, and I'm eager to work with you to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has a clear upper limit of $1,200,000. Alice's offer is still too high, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is already offering a ""discount"" from her perceived value. This suggests she's eager to sell and might be willing to negotiate further.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the counter-offer process and attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to stay closer to my original offer to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and get the product in your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is within Bob's acceptable range.  He has a maximum of $1,200,000 to spend. Accepting this offer saves him $250,000 compared to buying from John.

It's important to note that while Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
