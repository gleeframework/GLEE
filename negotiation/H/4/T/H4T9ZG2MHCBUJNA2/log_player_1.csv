Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a point where I can still make a good profit ($4,000) but is also attractive enough for Bob to consider given his $15,000 valuation. It leaves room for potential negotiation as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to counter his offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
