"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $150. I'm willing to come down to $160, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price!",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, which is my original target price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
