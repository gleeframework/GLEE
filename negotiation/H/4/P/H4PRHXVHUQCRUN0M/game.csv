I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me?,100.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,95.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. How about we meet at $95, but I'll throw in a small discount for you, so you'll get the product for $94.50?",94.5,Alice,5,,
