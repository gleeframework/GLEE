"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92.50 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. How about we meet at $95, but I'll throw in a small discount for you, so you'll get the product for $94.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $94.50 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close to his budget of $120.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's also the risk that she'll walk away or that Bob will run out of time and have to buy from John at a higher price.  

In this case, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and not significantly higher than his target price."
