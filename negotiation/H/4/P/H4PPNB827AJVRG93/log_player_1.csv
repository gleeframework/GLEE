"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, your initial price is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's true worth is significantly higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to securing this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the minimum I'm willing to accept. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
