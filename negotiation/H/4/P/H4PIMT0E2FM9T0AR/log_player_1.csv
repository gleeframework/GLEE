Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is far beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, given its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at his valuation, which is significantly below mine. While I want to find a compromise, it's clear I won't get close to my target price if I keep negotiating with him. It's time to move closer to my minimum and gauge his reaction."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a solution here, but I need you to be willing to move a bit as well. This product is incredibly valuable. Let's try $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a significant jump from Bob, and it indicates a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my last one to see if we can find a compromise."
