"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for compromise without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly, but not significantly.  I want to demonstrate flexibility, but also show that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer. By setting a price of $1,600,000, I'm aiming for a compromise that allows me to make a good profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise that's more favorable to me. Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant concession, but it's still within my minimum acceptable price. Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm also aware that I could sell to John at this price, but I'm hoping to secure a quicker sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  While I could keep negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching a price closer to my desired value might be difficult. I'm also running out of rounds. It's more prudent to sell to John at this point, as it guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quicker sale."
