"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I see the value you see in the product, $13,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to go with John's offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
