"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than my actual maximum budget ($150). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. I've clearly stated my interest in the product while also making it clear that the initial price is not acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a little too low for me. How about $150? That's my minimum price, and it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as I can buy it from John at this price anyway."
