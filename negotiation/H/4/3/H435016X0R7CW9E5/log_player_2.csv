The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, so Alice's offer is too high. I will reject and attempt to negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate and hopefully sets a good starting point for a compromise."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
