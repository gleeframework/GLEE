"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to secure a good portion of the surplus value. I'm confident that we can negotiate a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe we can still find a more favorable price. I'll counter his offer and aim for a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm reducing my price from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's current offer.  I'm confident we can reach a compromise within a few more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and I'm confident that I can potentially do better with John in future negotiations.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
