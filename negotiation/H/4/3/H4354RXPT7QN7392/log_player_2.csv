"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting quite a bit above her own valuation of the product. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or get closer to your $150 fallback option with John."
