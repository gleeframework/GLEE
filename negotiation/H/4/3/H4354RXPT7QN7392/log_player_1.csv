Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, a price too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
