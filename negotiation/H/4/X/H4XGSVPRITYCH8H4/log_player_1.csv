{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable offer:**  $120 is a decent middle ground between your minimum ($80) and Bob's maximum ($150).
* **It's polite and conversational:**  This shows Bob you're open to negotiation and willing to work with him. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a good price, and I get a fair deal for my time.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
