"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you as well. Let's start with a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's no immediate urgency to buy, so rejecting the offer allows for potential negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $120, which is still a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:**  A significant drop from $150 to $120 shows your serious intent to negotiate while still acknowledging Alice's perceived value. 
* **Positive messaging:** The message emphasizes fairness and value, making it less confrontational than a simple ""no.""
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows Alice to either accept, reject, or make a counter-counteroffer, giving you valuable information about her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Given the value of the product and the discussions we've had, I would like to propose a price of $135. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved from $150 to $135, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair price:**  $135 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. 
* **Potential for future savings:**  Accepting the offer now keeps the door open for potential discounts on future purchases from Alice. 

While there's always a chance you could negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth is too high.  $135 is a good deal and secures you the product within your budget."
