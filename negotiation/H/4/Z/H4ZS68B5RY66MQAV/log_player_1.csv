Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product to me is quite high, and $900,000 falls significantly short of that.  Could you consider a price closer to $1,050,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a number that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $975,000 is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly moving towards a higher price, the difference between his offer ($975,000) and John's standing offer ($1,200,000) is too significant.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price point that makes continuing negotiations worthwhile for Alice. Accepting John's offer guarantees Alice the full value she places on the product."
