Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.

**Why not go higher?**

While I could start at $1,200,000, there's a higher chance Bob will immediately reject it. This makes negotiation more difficult and risks losing him as a potential buyer entirely. Starting lower increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, he's shown interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000. This option remains available if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I will try to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for your business, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly higher than Bob's but still below my desired value. This shows flexibility while protecting my interests.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits it can bring to his business.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, indicating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Why not start at a higher price?**

While I could start higher, it might make Bob less likely to negotiate further. I'm aiming to strike a balance between being firm and being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, it's not enough to justify selling the product.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting that there might be a compromise we can reach.
* **Safety Net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which provides a secure fallback if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I will try to find a solution that is mutually acceptable while still ensuring I receive a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $700,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's latest offer of $700,000. This shows a clear commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to increase the pressure on Bob to accept. This strategy can incentivize him to close the deal rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether.
* **Value Recap:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, reinforcing the idea that $800,000 is a fair price considering its benefits for his business.

**Why not go lower?**

While I could go lower, I want to ensure I receive a price that is closer to my desired value. This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, and it gives him a chance to accept a deal that is still advantageous for him."
