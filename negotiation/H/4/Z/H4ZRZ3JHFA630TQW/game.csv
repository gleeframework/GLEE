"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering its market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for your business, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $700,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
