"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle right in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go below $115. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $110, but I need to make a profit.",115.0,Alice,7,
