"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you at $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on it at $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on it at $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
