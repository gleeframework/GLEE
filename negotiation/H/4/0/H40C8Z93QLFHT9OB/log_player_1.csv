Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, but still lower than your minimum of $150.  This gives you room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is closer to your minimum, you can still potentially do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to your minimum price, and Bob's counteroffer is only $3 below your initial counteroffer. You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and accepting Bob's offer would secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
