Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product at a starting price of $13,500. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth every penny for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's value, I'm aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
 
**Strategy:**

My goal is to create a back-and-forth negotiation that ideally lands somewhere above my $10,000 minimum.  I'm willing to make concessions, but I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffers. I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $10,000 if the negotiations aren't moving in a favorable direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate further before considering selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price that is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $13,500 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  This framing makes the $11,000 seem like a fair compromise, even though it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Above Minimum:**  This offer keeps me comfortably above my $10,000 minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both recognize in it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could potentially push for a bit more in another round of negotiation, the difference is relatively small. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
