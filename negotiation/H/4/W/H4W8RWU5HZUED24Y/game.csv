"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,100,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $1,250,000?  This feels like a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
