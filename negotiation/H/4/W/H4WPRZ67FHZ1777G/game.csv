"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's well above your value of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within my valuation range. In light of this, I would like to propose a revised offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This amount still allows for a significant profit while remaining competitive with your expectations. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget and we can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm still interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
