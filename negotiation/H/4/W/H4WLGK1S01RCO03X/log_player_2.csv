"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm really happy with. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's counter, showing willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I think $9,000 is still a bit low. How about we meet at $9,500, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll give you a 2-year warranty on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While still a bit above my initial target, the addition of the 2-year warranty adds value to the deal and makes $9,500 a reasonable price. Accepting now prevents potentially pushing Alice away and risking a worse outcome or having to go with John's higher price."
