You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $15,000 is above your budget.
* You have more rounds to negotiate with Alice, potentially getting a better price. 
* Buying from John right now would cost you more than potentially negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.
* $9,000 is still within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price. 
* I have more rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a price closer to my desired $10,000. 
* Buying from John now would be a good option if I can't secure a better price with Alice, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise.
* $10,500 is still within my budget, but it's a significant step closer to Alice's previous offer of $12,000. 
* This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product while also testing Alice's flexibility."
