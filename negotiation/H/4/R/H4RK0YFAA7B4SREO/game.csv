"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",725000.0,Alice,5,
