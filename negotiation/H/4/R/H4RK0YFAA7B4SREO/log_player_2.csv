Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's a decent price compared to John's offer.  It's best to accept and secure the deal."
