"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm confident its worth is far beyond what I'm asking, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant discount from what I know the product could fetch elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
