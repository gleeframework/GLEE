I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum value:** This gives me room to potentially negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's not an unreasonable price:**  I'm not starting with an outrageous number that would immediately make Bob say no. 

I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob, but if he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value."
