"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $1000000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
