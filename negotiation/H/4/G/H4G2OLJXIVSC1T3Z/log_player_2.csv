"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $900,000 is a good starting point for Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to propose a more favorable price. 
* **Buy from John is always an option:**  You can always choose to buy from John for $800,000, so you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My budget for this product is $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
