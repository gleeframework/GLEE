"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My budget for this product is $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
