"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. However, my initial offer already took into account the product's significant value to both of us. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This is my final offer.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but your offers don't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but this is my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been patient and tried to find common ground, but I'm starting to feel this negotiation isn't going anywhere productive. I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,090,000. If this doesn't work, I'm off to explore that other option I mentioned.",1090000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I've already compromised enough.
