"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, there's no advantage to accepting her offer. He can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate with her or find another seller who might offer a lower price."
