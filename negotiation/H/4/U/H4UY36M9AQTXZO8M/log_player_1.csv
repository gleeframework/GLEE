Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, this gives me a good starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower price, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, I'm not sure I can do much better. It's a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale for a few thousand dollars more."
