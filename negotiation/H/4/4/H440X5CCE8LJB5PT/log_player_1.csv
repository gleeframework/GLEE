{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be assertive but also open to negotiation to maximize the potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 10500}
