"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I want to make this deal work, $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to get at least $900,000 for the product to make it worth my while. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get $885,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",885000.0,Alice,5,
