Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to get at least $900,000 for the product to make it worth my while. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get $885,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** Alice's offer of $885,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,000,000 and a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** The negotiation has progressed, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this as her final offer, suggesting there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob $115,000 compared to John's offer and achieving a reasonable compromise with Alice."
