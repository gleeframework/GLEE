Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $175 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value ($150) by highlighting its inherent value. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
