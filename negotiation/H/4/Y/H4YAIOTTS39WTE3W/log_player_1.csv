Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" you provide a reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I believe"" and ""What do you think?"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more in control.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes Bob also sees the product's value. If he doesn't perceive it as worth significantly more than $800,000, he might walk away. 
* **Relationship:**  A very aggressive opening might damage your relationship with Bob. Consider if a softer approach might be better for long-term dealings."
