"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950000, considering the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1025000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $1075000 is still a bit higher than my target.  Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, while also ensuring a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1070000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,7,
