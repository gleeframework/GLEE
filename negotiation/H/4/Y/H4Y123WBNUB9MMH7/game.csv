"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To start, I'm asking $1200000. This reflects the product's true value and potential. I'm open to negotiating, so let's see where we can land.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value I've placed on this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1050000?  This still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and leaves room for us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $950000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm open to continuing to negotiate, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which would be a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
