"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $15,000. If Bob rejects my offers or the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore more options before selling to John.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim to meet him somewhere in the middle, but I'll be firm on my minimum price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the value the product offers you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reaffirming Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that the price is still fair.
* **Open to Negotiation (Again):** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going and encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By meeting in the middle, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice him to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  If we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll start thinking about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm not yet willing to settle for a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Window Shrinking:**  We're nearing the halfway point in negotiations, so I need to make sure my next counteroffer is compelling enough to get Bob closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still shows some flexibility.  I need to keep the pressure on Bob to either agree to a price closer to my desired amount or risk losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows you to save some money. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm raising my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet halfway.  
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the reason for the price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating in the next round if necessary. If we can't agree soon, I'll start to seriously consider selling to John and cutting my losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I need to push for a better deal or risk having to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one last counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but I'll leave some room for negotiation.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll be prepared to sell to John and avoid any further losses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've come a long way, and I'm really committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, but that's my final offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about buying, I urge you to accept. We're running out of time."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to reinforce the fairness of the price.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm reminding Bob that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, increasing the pressure to reach a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a price slightly closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum desired price. This is my last attempt to secure a deal with Bob before potentially selling to John.  My goal is to push Bob to accept, knowing that I can always go to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider a price of $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, we're running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Significant Loss:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, ensuring I don't have to settle for a significant loss.

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's becoming increasingly clear that we're too far apart on price. It's better to accept John's offer and secure my minimum desired price, rather than risk another round of negotiation that might not be successful."
