"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit too high at $16,000.  How about $15,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
