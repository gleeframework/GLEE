"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. I'm showing I'm serious about making a deal, but I still need to maintain a profitable sale.  Hopefully, this offer will entice Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm making a final push with $1,450,000. It's a small compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll have to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John in the next round."
