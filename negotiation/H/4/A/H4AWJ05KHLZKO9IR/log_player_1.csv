"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to try to save a bit of money. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my goal, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer him to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $92 is close enough to my target, and I'd rather sell it to Bob than risk losing out completely by going back and forth with him or selling to John."
