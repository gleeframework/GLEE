"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  It's definitely worth more than that to you, so I think this is a fair starting point.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to try to save a bit of money. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way, we both get a fair price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal with you.",92.0,Bob,4,
