"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $135 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet in the middle again at $127.50? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work.",127.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
