"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning there's still room for negotiation. Bob should counteroffer to see if he can secure a price closer to Alice's value."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a better price than her initial offer, it's still a bit high.  Bob can likely get it for closer to $850,000, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating. At this point, it's becoming a game of attrition.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but Bob might be able to get her to go even lower by counteroffering again.  He can aim for a price around $890,000 - $900,000, making a final push to close the deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has two choices:  

* **Accept the offer:** This saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John ($1,200,000). While it's not the lowest possible price, it's a good deal considering Alice's initial stance.
* **Reject the offer and counteroffer:** This risks Alice walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.

Given that Alice has been willing to negotiate and has already made several concessions, Bob should accept the offer. The chance of getting a lower price is low, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high."
