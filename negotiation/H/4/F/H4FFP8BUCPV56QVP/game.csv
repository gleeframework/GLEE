"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great price considering the value it holds. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it, which is the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $9500 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a fair price for the product. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $10000 for it.,10000.0,Bob,6,
