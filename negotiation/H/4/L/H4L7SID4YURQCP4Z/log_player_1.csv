"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($180) because I don't know Bob's value for the product. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a higher final price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly message to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message with a question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while also setting a high starting point for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell at that price right away. I want to see if I can get a better price through further negotiation.  

By rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation, I have the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand $180 was a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to accept $150 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I still value the product.
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language (""How about we meet in the middle?"") to encourage Bob to feel like we're working together.
* **Direct Question:** I end with a direct question to push for a response and potentially move the negotiation forward.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired price and demonstrating flexibility to keep the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While $130 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $180. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I'm keeping the door open to a higher price. Perhaps Bob will raise his offer in the next round. 

At this point, the risk of selling to John for $120 is increasing, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's the lowest I can go.  It's a great price for such a high-quality product! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm still maintaining a price point above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value (""great price for such a high-quality product"") to justify my asking price. 
* **Direct Question:** I'm using a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and make a decision.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still giving Bob the impression that there's not much room left for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's offer of $135 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. 
* **Limited Time:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer, and I'm running out of time.  
* **Balancing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and a decent profit, though it's not my ideal price.

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure a sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
