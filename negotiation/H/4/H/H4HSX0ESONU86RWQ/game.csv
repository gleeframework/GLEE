"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me, but I'm definitely interested.  How about we start around  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would make sense.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
