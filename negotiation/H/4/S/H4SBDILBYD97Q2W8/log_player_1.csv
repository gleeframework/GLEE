Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a decent markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Offering a Fair Price:** While I'm trying to maximize my profit, I want to keep Bob engaged. A reasonable opening price increases the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate. This signals to Bob that I'm open to a deal. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000, which gives me a safety net and the confidence to walk away if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John Provides a Safety Net:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000, which makes rejecting Bob's offer a less risky option. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the counteroffer more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Margin:**  $9,500 is still a decent profit for me, considering my minimum acceptable price is $12,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive, emphasizing that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:** By not immediately accepting or rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  It's a fair compromise that could get us both to a point where we're happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  $9,250 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than Bob's previous offer of $8,500.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While $9,250 isn't my ideal price, it's possible I could negotiate a bit higher in future rounds. However, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer again.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. Accepting the offer now allows me to close the deal and avoid potential complications.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting Bob's offer gives me a sure sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
