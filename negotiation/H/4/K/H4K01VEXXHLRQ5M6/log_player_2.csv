# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price, but it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and closer to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
