{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves $100,000 on the table for Bob, giving him incentive to accept. However, it also leaves me with a healthy profit, significantly more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
