{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum price of $100.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating further is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. Since he's willing to pay $100 at most, he starts with his maximum offer, hoping Alice will be willing to accept."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $100.  While it's closer than the previous round,  it's still worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum. He has 5 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal. Therefore, it's worth rejecting and continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum price but still has some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that he is serious about buying but also wants a better deal.  It's also a more significant increase in his offer than the previous round, which could encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $118 is still too high for Bob, and he only has 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the guaranteed price from John for $100. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not result in a lower price."
