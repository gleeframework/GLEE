"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold and what John is offering. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,550,000? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,475,000? This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,475,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $1,512,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,460,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned that we're not making significant progress. There's only a limited number of rounds left, and I'm confident that John will buy the product at my desired price."
