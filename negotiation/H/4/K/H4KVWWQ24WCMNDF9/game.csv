"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,550,000? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,475,000? This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
