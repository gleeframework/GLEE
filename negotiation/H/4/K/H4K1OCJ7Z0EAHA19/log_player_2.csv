"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than your maximum value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $75 is a good starting point for a counteroffer. It's likely she will accept it, as it's still a profit for her, and it gives you a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than your maximum value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You already rejected her previous offer of $90, so it's likely she will be more flexible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still too high.  You're willing to pay up to $120, but you want to save as much as possible. Offering $80 is a compromise, as it's still a profit for Alice and gives you a decent discount. It's also a good tactic to show you're serious about buying the product but aren't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still a bit high, though it's getting closer to your maximum value. You've already rejected her previous offer of $95, and you are willing to pay up to $120, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps offering prices above your maximum, but you're determined to get a better deal. Offering $85 is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise but still want to save money. This might convince Alice to accept, as it's a reasonable price for her. It's getting close to your maximum, so you'll need to carefully consider if the next offer is worth pursuing or if you should buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps offering prices above your maximum of $120.  You have rejected her previous offer of $95, and she's now repeating that offer. It's clear she's not willing to budge much, and you're running out of time. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $120, even though it's not ideal. It guarantees you'll get the product and avoids further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
