"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation while still staying within a range that's attractive to Bob.
* **Justification:** I've included a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests I'm open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. Please let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is strong, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. Accepting $1,300,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway and settle on a price of $1,350,000? This recognizes the product's true value while still making it a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by offering a price directly in the middle of our previous offers. 
* **Value Focus:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Clarity and Simplicity:**  The offer is clear and concise, making it easier for Bob to accept."
