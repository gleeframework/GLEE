Alice's offer:

This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to move this product without taking too much of a loss.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd find acceptable, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  She might not go any lower, and I have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
