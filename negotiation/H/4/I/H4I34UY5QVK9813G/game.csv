"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm ready to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $100. I'll sell the product to you for $102.50. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
