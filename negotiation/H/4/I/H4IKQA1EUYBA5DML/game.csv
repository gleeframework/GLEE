"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12500.0,Alice,5,
