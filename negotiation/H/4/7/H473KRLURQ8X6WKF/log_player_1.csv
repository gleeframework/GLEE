Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of selling significantly above your minimum makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
