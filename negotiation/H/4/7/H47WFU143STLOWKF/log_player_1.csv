Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $125. It's still a bit above my preferred price point, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my desired price and getting closer to a deal. Accepting the offer would mean getting a decent profit with a smaller chance of getting a better offer in the remaining rounds."
