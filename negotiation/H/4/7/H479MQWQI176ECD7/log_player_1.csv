Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal considering its value and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with it."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it just below our guaranteed sale price creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. 
* **Psychology:**  The price of $14,999 feels like a significant discount compared to our ""backup"" offer, making it more appealing to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a sale that earns a profit close to the maximum possible, without risking a rejection from Bob and having to sell to John."
