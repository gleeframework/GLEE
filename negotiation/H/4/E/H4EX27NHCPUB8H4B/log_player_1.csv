Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 180}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think carefully about it...

Since I don't want to sell the product for less than $150, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. I'll try to find a price that's higher than $120 but lower than $180.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 160}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's original offer was $120, and my counteroffer was $160, I'll try to find a price that's slightly higher than $120 but lower than $160. I'll make a new offer that's closer to Bob's original price.

{""product_price"": 130}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is getting lower and lower! I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than $100 but lower than $150. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle again.
