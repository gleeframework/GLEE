"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is still a very good price for the value you'll receive, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
