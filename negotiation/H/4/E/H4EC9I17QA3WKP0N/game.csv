"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is not a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
