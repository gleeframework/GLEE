"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price lower than its value to you, and I'll still get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $10,000.  You want to try to get closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice has come down to $9,500, which is very close to your maximum budget. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, especially considering that you can always buy from John for $8,000 if this deal falls through."
