Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price lower than its value to you, and I'll still get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($2,000) while also being attractive to Bob, who can still gain $2,000 from the deal. 

This strategy allows me to test the waters with Bob while keeping the option open to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still willing to hold out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
