"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price lower than its value to you, and I'll still get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go right now.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,3,
