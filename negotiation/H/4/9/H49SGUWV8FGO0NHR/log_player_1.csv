"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer will help me understand Bob's negotiating style and how eager he is to secure the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind my fallback option with John, ensuring I don't settle for anything less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I started high, and he countered with a significant jump down. This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll aim for a price closer to $1 million in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not drastically. The $1,025,000 counteroffer keeps me above the midpoint between our initial offers, aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  My message emphasizes that Bob's offer is too low, reinforcing the product's value.  The ""meet in the middle"" approach can seem fair and encourage agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my valuation of the product, I can't agree to $1,025,000. Let's try $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  While $975,000 is tempting, I believe there's still some negotiating room left, especially considering we have several rounds remaining. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's aim to close this deal.  How about $1,000,000 - it's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm price at $1,000,000. This represents a significant profit margin for me while still being a good deal for Bob, considering its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I introduce a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **Walking Away Point:** It's getting close to the point where further haggling might be counterproductive. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I need to be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $980,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $980,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum by $180,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers.  It's unlikely he'll drastically move from this point, and further negotiation might be time-consuming with little potential gain.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a highly favorable outcome."
