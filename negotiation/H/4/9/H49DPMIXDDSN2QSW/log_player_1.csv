"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but doesn't value the product as highly as I do.  Since I have the option of selling to John for $120, I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can get closer to my goal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $150.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and hopefully it will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit to try and get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price. Since I have the option of selling to John for $120, there's no immediate rush to accept a lower offer. I'm hoping to close a deal with Bob at a higher price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $130.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I need to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting to try and get a slightly higher price, but with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees I get my minimum price, and I can always try to sell to John later if I change my mind."
