Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. By offering $100, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still making a good profit.  It's also a good tactic to start by asking for more than you expect to get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it. It's still above my minimum price of $80, and it avoids the risk of him walking away and me having to sell to John for less."
