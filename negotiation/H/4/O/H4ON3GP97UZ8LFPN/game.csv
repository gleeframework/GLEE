"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,500 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
