Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a safety net with John at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize my profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $150,000 discount from his perceived value.
    * I make a significant profit of $350,000 above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By framing it as a ""one-time offer"" and highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm adding a level of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept."
