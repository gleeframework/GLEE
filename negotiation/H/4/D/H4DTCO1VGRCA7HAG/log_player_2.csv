"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you, Bob! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and allows you to save $600,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice to maximize your savings."
