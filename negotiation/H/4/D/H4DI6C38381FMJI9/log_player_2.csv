"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a valuable asset with great potential. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  I need to negotiate a lower price.  While I could buy from John for $1,000,000, I'd rather see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try and push her down further with a counteroffer.  However, John's offer is always a backup option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
