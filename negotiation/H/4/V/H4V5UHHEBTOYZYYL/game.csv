,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation of the product.  Let's seal the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
