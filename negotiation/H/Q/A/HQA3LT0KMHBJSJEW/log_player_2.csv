"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000.

Alice's offer is far too high. It's much better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle at $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $17000 to make this deal worthwhile. Can we meet at $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $12,000. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us, and this feels like a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm thinking we're getting close, though. How about we meet at $16000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get the deal done, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where I should consider other options. Let's meet at $19000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is getting stubborn and pushing for a price much higher than your budget.  You've reached a point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget."
