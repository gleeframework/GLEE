Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation, and it's below your minimum acceptable price.  By offering a price close to your minimum, I can ensure that I won't lose out on too much money if Bob rejects the offer. I'll also be able to assess if he's willing to negotiate or if he's simply not interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, hoping to reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price, and I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, it makes more sense to sell the product to him.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John."
