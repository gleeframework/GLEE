"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know the product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  A $5,000 offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I still believe there's room for a better deal. By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. This approach allows for a potential meeting point with Alice's offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,500 is closer to my desired price range.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or the negotiations could drag on.  Accepting this offer is a good balance between getting a decent price and not risking losing the deal or wasting time."
