"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! $10,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $12,000?  This is still a good price for you considering the value of the product, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",12000.0,Alice,3,
