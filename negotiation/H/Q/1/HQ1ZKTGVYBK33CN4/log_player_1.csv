Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential benefits for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product but I'm only able to go up to $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value for the product.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $9000.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a decent offer.  It's above my minimum value and we're getting close to a deal.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure a sale."
