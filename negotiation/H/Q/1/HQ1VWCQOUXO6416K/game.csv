"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,150,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is my best offer,  and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget limitations.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't accept a price as low as $1,050,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price point.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
