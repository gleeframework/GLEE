{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that gives you a good profit margin but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a safety net of $12,000 from John, so I can afford to be somewhat flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I can likely do better.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for your product. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is significantly better than my minimum and still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I'll accept his offer and avoid risking a further decrease in price or the need to sell to John for less."
