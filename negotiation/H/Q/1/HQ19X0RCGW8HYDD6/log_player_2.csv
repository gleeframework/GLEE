```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500.

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $13000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. Let's see if we can get to a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, I can't go any higher than $12,750. This is a good compromise for us both, and we can finalize the deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're really close now! I'm willing to meet you at $13200, which is just a small increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has a goal of saving money and has been consistently trying to negotiate a lower price. Alice has come down slightly in price, but she's still above Bob's maximum price.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,200.  While there are a few rounds remaining,  Bob can secure the product from John for his maximum budget of $12,000.  This guarantees him the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
