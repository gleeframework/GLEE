{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me, hoping to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can afford $110. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still securing a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum, and it seems like he's firm on his offer. It's better to secure a sale than to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing or selling to John for only $100."
