"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000.
