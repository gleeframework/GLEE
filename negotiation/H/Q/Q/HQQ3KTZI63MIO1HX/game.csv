"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of 85, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. I can offer you the product for 95. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
