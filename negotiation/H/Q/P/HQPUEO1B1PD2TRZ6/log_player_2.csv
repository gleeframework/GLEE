"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $10,000 to him, rejecting the initial offer of $9,000 is the best course of action. He can then counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and still within Bob's budget. It's also closer to his counteroffer than Alice's previous offer, showing that she is willing to negotiate. Since Bob wants to save money and get the product, accepting this offer makes the most sense."
