{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $850,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd like to make a bigger profit, I'm not comfortable dropping my price any further. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm happy with the outcome."
