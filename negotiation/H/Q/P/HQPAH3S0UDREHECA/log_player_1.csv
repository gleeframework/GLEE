"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. I believe there's room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $140,  I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and I think it's reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $155.  This is a more aggressive price, but I think I can get it.  We're getting closer to the middle ground and I'm confident Bob will be more willing to negotiate."
