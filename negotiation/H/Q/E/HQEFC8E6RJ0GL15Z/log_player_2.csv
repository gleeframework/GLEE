You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  There are 9 more rounds, so you have plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility. This allows me to gauge her interest in selling at a lower price while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I still have time to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than her offer, and I'm confident I can get a better price than $450,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $425,000, which is a good price for me.  I've already negotiated for several rounds and I don't want to risk losing the product to John by continuing to negotiate.  There's also a risk that Alice could increase her offer in subsequent rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on this good deal."
