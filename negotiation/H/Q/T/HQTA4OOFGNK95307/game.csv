"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $16800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16800.0,Alice,5,
