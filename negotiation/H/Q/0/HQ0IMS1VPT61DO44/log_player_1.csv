{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $135. It's still a great deal for a product that's worth much more to me.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is refusing to budge from his $130 offer. I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John, and I'm not sure if I can convince Bob to go any higher. To avoid risking getting an even lower price in the next round, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
