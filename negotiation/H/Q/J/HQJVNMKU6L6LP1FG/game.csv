"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I'm confident you'll see great value in it.  My initial price is $1,000,000. This reflects the product's high quality and potential.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return. Let's split the difference. My counteroffer is $925,000.  This price still allows for a good margin for you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my expenses. I'm thinking of offering $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $900,000. This price recognizes your budget and still allows me a reasonable profit. It's a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
