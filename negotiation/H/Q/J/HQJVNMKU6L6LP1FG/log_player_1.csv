Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
