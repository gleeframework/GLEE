"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",13500.0,Bob,6,
