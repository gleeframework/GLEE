**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from a starting point that's higher than your maximum price and even higher than John's offer. You have room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about a lower price and increase your chances of getting a better deal closer to John's $1,500,000 fallback."
