,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I respect your position on this, and I'm trying to find a number that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,975,000? That's a significant move on my end.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1950000.0,Bob,6,
