"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. How does $140 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($120). 
* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $150, but want to save money.
* **John's Price:** John acts as a price ceiling. You know you can get the product for $150.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either lower the price or you default to buying from John. Since Alice still has room to make a profit, there's a good chance she'll counter-offer with a lower price."
