Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to stay within budget, however, $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $750,000 represents a fair valuation for the product. I am unable to increase my offer further at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $750,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap to a price that reflects the product's value to us. Accepting John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
