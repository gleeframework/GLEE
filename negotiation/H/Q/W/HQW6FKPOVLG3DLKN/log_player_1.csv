Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

We're still significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. It's time to nudge Bob closer to a more reasonable offer."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but we're still quite a ways apart.  This product offers significant value that justifies a higher price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. If you're serious about selling this product, I believe this is the best option for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

}
```

Bob seems firmly set at $1,100,000. It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to him at this point rather than risk a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate in the negotiation."
