"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $14000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $16000. I'll give you a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $15800. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",15800.0,Alice,5,
