"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than your maximum budget ($120), you know you have another option with John for $120. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
