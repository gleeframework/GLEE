"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value and potential. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price of $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $1000000.  Consider this your chance to secure something truly special.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000.  You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000, saving you $500,000."
