"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you see in the product, and it also allows me to recover some of my investment.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
