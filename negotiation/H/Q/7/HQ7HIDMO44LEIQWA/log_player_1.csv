{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."

Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
