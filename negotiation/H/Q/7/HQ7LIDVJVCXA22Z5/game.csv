"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
