"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000. How about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  Let's settle on $1,112,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $1,112,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
