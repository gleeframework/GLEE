# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for less than $10,000 from John if your negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. What do you think?

While Alice has come down a bit, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target of $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $11,200 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:

It's getting close, but Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
