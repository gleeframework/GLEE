"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high.  There's room to negotiate and save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still more than he'd like to pay. He can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $1,500,000 if he has to."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
