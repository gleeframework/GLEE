"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for a fair profit for you and a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to pay a fair amount.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a win-win, allowing you to sell quickly and me to acquire the product at a good price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
