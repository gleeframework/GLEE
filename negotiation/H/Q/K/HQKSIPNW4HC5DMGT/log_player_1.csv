Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This offer is time-sensitive, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, you want to aim high to maximize your potential profit. Starting at $18,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Remember, your bottom line is $12,000."
