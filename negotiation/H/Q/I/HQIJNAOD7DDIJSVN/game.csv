"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable paying that much.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering I'm paying you more than what it's worth to me.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm confident that the product is worth more than what you're offering, but I'm open to negotiating. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
