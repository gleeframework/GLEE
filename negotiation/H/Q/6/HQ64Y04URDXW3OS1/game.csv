"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find this to be a very lucrative deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's close this transaction, I believe we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1,000,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
