"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,600,000? This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
