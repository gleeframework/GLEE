Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **Being Friendly:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer rather than immediately rejecting.
* **Knowing my backup:** I am aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.
* **I have a better option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and I'm not yet at a point where I need to compromise that much.
* **Room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially getting closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but staying firm:** My counteroffer is a compromise, lowering the price but not significantly.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a favorable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain from purchasing it.
* **Opening the door for a deal:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing to Bob, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No significant progress:** Bob has remained firm at $850,000, which is still below my desired price.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and may not result in a significantly better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get the highest possible price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, I am willing to take the guaranteed profit of $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
