Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,100. I'll make one more counteroffer, and that's $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Reason: Alice has gone back up in price and seems firm on $11,500. It's unlikely she'll go substantially lower. It's better to cut losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 deal from John rather than risk Alice not budging and ending up with a worse outcome."
