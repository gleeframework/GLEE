"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can see the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"This is a fair deal, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,100? This is my final offer.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,100. I'll make one more counteroffer, and that's $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,7,
