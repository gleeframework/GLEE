"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $115 for it. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I can try to negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand her flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to my limit but leaving space for one last potential compromise from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could you do $95? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about the purchase but have a firm budget.  By stating it's the ""highest I can go,"" I'm hoping Alice will accept rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $100, which matches the price John offers. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and there's no point in further negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at my target price."
