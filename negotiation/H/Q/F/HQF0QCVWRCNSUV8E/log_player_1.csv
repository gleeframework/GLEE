Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $2,000,000 is a good starting point. It allows for negotiation and gives room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and potential value to Bob. This subtly sets a high bar for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While stating a clear price, the message also conveys a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John as an alternative buyer subtly increases the pressure on Bob to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  The goal is to maximize profit. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the absolute minimum, and accepting Bob's offer would leave $300,000 on the table.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. He's clearly interested, and I can likely get a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale. It also positions me to set a higher price in the next round and potentially extract a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business, I believe $1,900,000 is a fair price. It's a compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  Offering $1,900,000  is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Value and Potential:** The message reiterates the product's worth and its potential benefits for Bob, subtly reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, keeping the negotiation constructive and encouraging Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Common Ground:** The message focuses on finding common ground, signaling flexibility and a desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  The goal is to maximize profit.  Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than $1,500,000, indicating he values the product. There's still a chance to get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer again keeps the pressure on him. It also allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to $1,800,000, perhaps $1,750,000, aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Call to Action:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Confidence and Finality:** The tone is firm and confident, suggesting that this is my final offer,  giving Bob an incentive to accept to avoid further negotiation."
