# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a price you can live with.
