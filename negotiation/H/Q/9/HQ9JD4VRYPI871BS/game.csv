"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about $100?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. $92 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle at $95. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $92.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $92.50 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $93.75.  That way we're both happy, right?",93.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $93.75 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $91, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal",91.0,Bob,8,
