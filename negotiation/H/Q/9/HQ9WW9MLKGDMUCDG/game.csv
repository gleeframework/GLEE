"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the benefits you'll gain from the product, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for your product, and I'm trying to get the best deal for myself.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm still comfortable with my initial offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair, and it allows for a profitable deal for both parties.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a little.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to accept your initial offer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
