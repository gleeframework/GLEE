# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $800,000 to me, and she's asking for $1,100,000. I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, and she's asking for $975,000.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground.  I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement before I have to go with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original counteroffer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and our previous negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to go above my maximum of $800,000.  It's time to move on and take John's offer. It's the best deal for me at this point."
