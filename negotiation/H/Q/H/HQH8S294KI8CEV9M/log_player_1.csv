Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than the product's value to Bob ($80), but not excessively so. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""great product"" and ""you'd really like it"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with ""What do you think?"" to show that I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer.
* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel it's not going anywhere, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Exploring Counteroffer:** I'm going to try a counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $90 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate and adjust my price, indicating a desire to reach a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes meeting in the middle, fostering a collaborative tone.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, I've secured a price close to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will take more time and effort, which may not be worth the potential small gain.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $92. This is a good outcome as it's close to my desired price and I've avoided further negotiation."
