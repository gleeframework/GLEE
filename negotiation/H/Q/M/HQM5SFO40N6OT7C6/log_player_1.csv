Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not under too much pressure to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a higher price. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and can still get my minimum by selling to John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us might find agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and allows me to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer or me ending up selling to John for the same price."
