Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  
* **Testing the waters:** Offering it at $15,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Clear and firm:**  The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach avoids lengthy negotiations and sets a clear expectation.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, given the potential for a 50% profit, it's a calculated risk worth taking. If Bob rejects it, you still have your guaranteed sale to John."
