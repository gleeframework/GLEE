``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially get a better deal from Alice or switch to John as a last resort."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you truly place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While she's moving closer to your initial offer, it's still not within your range. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you might be able to reach a compromise or potentially even get a lower price than John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to make a healthy margin and ensures I get a valuable product within my financial constraints.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price I had in mind. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While she's been willing to compromise, it's clear that she's not going to go lower.  It's more advantageous at this point to go with John's offer, as it guarantees you the product within your budget.  Even though you'll be paying a premium compared to what you initially hoped for, it's still the best option available to you at this stage of the negotiation."
