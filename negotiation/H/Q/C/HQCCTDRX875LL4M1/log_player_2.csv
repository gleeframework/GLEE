Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to do it for $90?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $92.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower and we're already getting a good deal. It's better to secure the product at $92.50 than risk the price going back up or running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $100."
