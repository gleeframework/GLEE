I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a bit above my minimum, but I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I don't know how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$12,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly to $17,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering me a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better deal for me.  I'm going to sell to John."
