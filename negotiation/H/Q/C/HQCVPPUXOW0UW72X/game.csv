"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1150000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $1275000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
