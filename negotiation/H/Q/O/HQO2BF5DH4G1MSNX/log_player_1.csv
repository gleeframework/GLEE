Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000. This gives me a strong fallback position and prevents me from accepting a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what John is offering. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000 to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to save, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down significantly from my initial offer, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price above John's offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer allows for further negotiation, potentially reaching a price closer to $10,500-$11,000, which would be a win for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,200 is now higher than John's offer of $10,000. While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
