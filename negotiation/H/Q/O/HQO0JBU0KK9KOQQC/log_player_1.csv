Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While $175 is more than Bob values the product at, it's still a gamble worth taking.  Bob might decide to pay a premium if he really wants the product and doesn't want to risk missing out. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. You can then sell the product to John for your minimum price of $150."
