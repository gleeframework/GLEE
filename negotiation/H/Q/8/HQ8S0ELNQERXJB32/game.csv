"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, but I'd really like to get it for less than that. How about we try $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
