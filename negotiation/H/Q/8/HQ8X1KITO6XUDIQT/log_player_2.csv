Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $145. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like the product!

It's unlikely Alice will go below $145, and at this point, it's more cost-effective to buy from John for $150.  Continuing the negotiation might not yield a better result."
