"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $130 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? That's the absolute maximum I can do.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is the maximum you can do, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is still a good deal for both of us. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Alice,5,
