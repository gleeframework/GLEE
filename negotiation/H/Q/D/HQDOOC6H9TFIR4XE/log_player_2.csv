"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $9,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, offering $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $9,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and allows Bob to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has increased her offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal.  He can still potentially get a better price than $9,500 from Alice, and  he has the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,500. This is still a good deal for him, as it's lower than Alice's offer and closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to find a mutually acceptable price.  It keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is getting very close to Bob's maximum price of $12,000, leaving very little room for further negotiation.  While he could try to negotiate again, the risk is that Alice might keep increasing her offer until it reaches $12,000, forcing him to pay the same price as he would from John. It's more efficient for Bob to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
