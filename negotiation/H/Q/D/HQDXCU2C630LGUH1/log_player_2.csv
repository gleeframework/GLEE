"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is also $15,000, you have no room to negotiate. It's better to buy from John to avoid the risk of a longer negotiation with Alice."
