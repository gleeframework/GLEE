"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). By rejecting the offer, Bob opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price and getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. However, it's still a bit more than Bob's ideal price. Considering that Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $15,000, it makes sense for him to choose John. This way, Bob ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the potential of further negotiations with Alice, which might lead to an even higher price."
