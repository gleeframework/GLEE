Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know John will buy it for $150, aiming slightly lower with Bob first allows us to potentially earn a bit more. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still a potential deal for him if he values the product's other qualities.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downward, staying above the $150 floor John guarantees. 
 
Let's see what Bob says!"
