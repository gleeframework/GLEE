Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and deal for Bob, while still potentially earning me a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a firm offer, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures I don't go below my minimum."
