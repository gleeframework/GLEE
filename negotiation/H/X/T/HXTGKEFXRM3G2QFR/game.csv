"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I can go as low as $1,600,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise that still recognizes the true worth of what's on the table.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
