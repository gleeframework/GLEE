Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with my desired price, even though it's higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is expected in negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $150, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.
* **Counteroffer:** I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $150 to $135, showing flexibility.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $135 is a good price for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $110 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $150. 
* **Time is Money:** Continued negotiation takes time, and I can get a better deal immediately with John."
