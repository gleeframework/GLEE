"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I'm unable to accept $6,000. However, I would like to propose $9,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to retain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a more favorable price than initially suggested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $7,000?  That would be a great price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Bob. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product at $8,000. This price not only respects your budget but also ensures a fair return for us. I believe this is the best we can do in reaching an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
