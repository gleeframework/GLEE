"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  There's no reason to accept it at this point. It's better to counteroffer and see if you can get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair given the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your budget, it's still outside your comfort zone.  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  It shows a willingness to meet in the middle.  However, I still need to make a profit on this deal.  Let's split the difference and try $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above your target of $800,000. You've already shown willingness to compromise, and it's worth exploring if Alice will budge further before you commit to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  This is a significant step forward, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,015,000?  This is a significant increase from your last offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is tempting, it's still above your budget. You have already shown significant willingness to compromise, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get the price down further. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John at $800,000.  This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice without a guaranteed outcome."
