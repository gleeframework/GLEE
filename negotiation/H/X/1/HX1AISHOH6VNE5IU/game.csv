"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair given the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  It shows a willingness to meet in the middle.  However, I still need to make a profit on this deal.  Let's split the difference and try $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  This is a significant step forward, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,015,000?  This is a significant increase from your last offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. ",1015000.0,Alice,7,
