Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value and coming back with an offer.  To be candid, $1,200,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both, so I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
