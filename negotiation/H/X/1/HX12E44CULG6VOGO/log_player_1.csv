Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $14,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your minimum desired price ($15,000). 
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging message is important to maintain a good relationship with Bob and make him feel valued. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This strategy allows for potential negotiation, while also setting a clear price point that is beneficial to you. 

By starting at $14,000, you create room for negotiation while ensuring you won't be losing out on your minimum desired value.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss.  While selling to John for $15,000 is an attractive option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  This will give me the opportunity to potentially earn more than $11,000 without having to settle for his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to recoup a fair amount of my investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's attempt to compromise and using positive language (""great deal"").  I'm also highlighting the value proposition for Bob by emphasizing that it's still a ""great deal."" 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By meeting in the middle, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price point that is closer to my minimum desired value.

This counteroffer shows good faith and creates an opportunity for a successful negotiation. We'll see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on $12,000. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is still below my ideal price, it is very close to my minimum desired value of $15,000.  It's clear Bob is not willing to go higher, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. 

Considering the potential of losing Bob as a buyer and the possibility of having to start the negotiation process with another buyer, accepting his offer for $12,000 is the most financially viable option at this time."
