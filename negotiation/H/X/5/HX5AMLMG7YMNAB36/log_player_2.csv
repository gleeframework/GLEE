It's too expensive. You can definitely get a better deal by counteroffering or buying from John."

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it shows that you're serious about buying the product but are willing to pay a fair price. It's a good starting point for negotiation."

While Alice has come down in price, $18,000 is still a bit too high. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering again."

This offer is close to your maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so this counteroffer demonstrates that you're serious about purchasing the product while remaining within your price range."

While this is a tempting price,  you can still do better.  A counteroffer shows Alice that you are serious about getting the product, but you are also determined to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}

This counteroffer is a compromise. You're willing to pay a little more than your initial target but are still trying to save some money. It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product and are willing to meet her halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but at this point, it's best to buy from John.  Alice's price is getting closer, but you've already made multiple counteroffers, and she's not showing much willingness to come down further. John offers a guaranteed price that's within your budget, and you don't want to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
