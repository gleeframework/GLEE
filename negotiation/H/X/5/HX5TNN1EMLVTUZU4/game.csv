"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500? This would be a fair compromise, and allows you to still gain value from the product.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,250? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means.",14250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $14,250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop my price to $14,750. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to make a profit.",14750.0,Alice,5,
