{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and $175 is closer, but I can't go that high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $150.  That's a fair price for both of us.
