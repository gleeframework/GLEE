Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he might be able to negotiate the price down a little, potentially making him more likely to engage. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a profitable sale regardless of his decision."
