"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I would like to propose a price of $85 for this transaction. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $85 is a decent offer, there's room for negotiation, especially since both of us value the product at $100. I'll counter with a lower price to see if we can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway at $80 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while being fair to both parties. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd still prefer $75, $80 is a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a price that's within my budget and saves me $20 compared to buying from John."
