Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer, there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and ensuring a profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price."
