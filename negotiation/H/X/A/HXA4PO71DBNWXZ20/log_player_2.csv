{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to our final round, and Alice's offer of $12,750 is still higher than my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the product.  

I've already spent several rounds trying to reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's clear that Alice won't budge significantly lower.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000 to ensure I get the product at a price within my budget."
