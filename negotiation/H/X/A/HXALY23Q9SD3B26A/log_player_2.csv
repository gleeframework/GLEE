"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $9,000.  Since you know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $9,000.  It's still a profitable deal for Alice, as it's $500 above her value for the product.  This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept, but also sets the tone for a lower negotiation price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, $9,200 is still too high. You want to try to get closer to your target price of $8,500. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected your offer of $8,500, so it's time to increase the offer slightly to show willingness to compromise. $8,800 is still below Alice's previous offer, but it's also closer to the target price range. This approach keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is actually higher than her previous offer of $9,200.  This is likely a tactic to try to push you towards a deal. However, you're still aiming for a lower price.  It's important to be patient and not give in to pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be playing a bit of a game, increasing her offer instead of coming down. We need to keep pushing for a lower price, but we also need to avoid making offers that are too far apart.  $8,900 is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still keeping the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is again increasing her offer, likely hoping to get you to accept. It's clear that she's trying to push you towards a deal that benefits her more than you.  You need to be persistent and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your acceptable range, but still too high. However, this is the last round before you have to consider John's offer.  $9,000 is a compromise that shows your willingness to move towards a deal while also pushing Alice to meet you halfway. This might be the final chance to get a deal before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still increasing her price, which is a clear sign that she's not willing to come down to a price that's reasonable for you.  This is the final round before you have to make a decision, and you're running out of time to get a better deal.  While buying from John is not ideal, it's the best option at this point.  You're still within your budget and avoiding a deal that would be significantly less favorable."
