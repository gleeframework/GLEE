# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think this is a great price considering the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is still the most financially beneficial option."
