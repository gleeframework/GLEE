"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
