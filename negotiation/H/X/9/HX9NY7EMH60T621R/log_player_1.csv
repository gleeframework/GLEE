"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so I'm hoping to get close to that without risking losing him completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,500 is still too low, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise, but still leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I still think I can get a better price. I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested and will come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal. If he still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. We're down to the wire and there's not much room for negotiation left. Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher, and while I'd prefer more money, it's better to secure a sale than risk losing the deal entirely."
