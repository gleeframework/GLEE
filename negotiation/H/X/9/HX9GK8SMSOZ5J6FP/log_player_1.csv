Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's potential to reach a price that benefits both of you.
* **It's assertive:** This offer shows you're confident in your product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still below your initial target.  Since you have the option to sell to John for $8,000, you're in a stronger position to push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering allows you to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. It's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $9,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price, and you're still getting a better deal than you'd get from selling to John. It's important to recognize that further negotiations might not lead to a significantly higher price, and could potentially risk losing the deal altogether."
