Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
