Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Win-Win Proposition:**  The price is still attractive to Bob as it's significantly lower than your minimum and allows him to gain $500,000 in value ($1,300,000 offer - $800,000 value). 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
