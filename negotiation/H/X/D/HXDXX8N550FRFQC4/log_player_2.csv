"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to your operations. While I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to achieve a profitable sale.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I will be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting the initial offer, you're essentially testing her willingness to negotiate."
