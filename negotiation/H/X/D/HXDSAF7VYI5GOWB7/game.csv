"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good value.  Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let's see if we can make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
