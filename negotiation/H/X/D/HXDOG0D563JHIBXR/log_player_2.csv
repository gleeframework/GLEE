"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget. It shows that you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to overpay. This will hopefully encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,000? That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You have several rounds left, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to bring the price down even further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

By reiterating your previous counteroffer, you demonstrate your seriousness about the product while holding firm on your desired price point. This strategy can potentially create a sense of urgency for Alice, encouraging her to consider your offer."
