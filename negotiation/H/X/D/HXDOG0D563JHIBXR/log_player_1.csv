Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,000? That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob,  he's stuck at $10,500, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get much closer to my desired price.  It's better to secure the deal with John and get the $12,000 I'm aiming for."
