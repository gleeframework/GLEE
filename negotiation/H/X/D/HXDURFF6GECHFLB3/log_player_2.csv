"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she knows you have an alternative option."
