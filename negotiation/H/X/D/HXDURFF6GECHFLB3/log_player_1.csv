Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering the product for $119 allows you to capture most of the potential profit ($19) while still giving Bob a reason to buy (saving $1 compared to his perceived value). 

If you were to ask for more (like $120), Bob would be indifferent between buying from you or not, and you risk him rejecting the offer."
