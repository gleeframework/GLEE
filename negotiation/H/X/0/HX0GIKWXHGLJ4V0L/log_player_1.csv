Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable for your business. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, but this is a starting point that reflects the value I see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. It's likely he'll be willing to go up a bit to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This price allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum price of $800,000.  While I'm not thrilled about it, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm determined to get as close to my ideal price as possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your ongoing interest in this product.  However, I'm still not quite there with your offer. To ensure a successful deal for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This price is a significant move towards your offer, and it's a price I believe reflects the value we both recognize in this opportunity. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $790,000 is closer to my minimum price of $800,000, but it's still not ideal. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my goal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your continued interest in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $805,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 805000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there with $805,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final two rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $800,000.  I've made significant compromises and it's unlikely Bob will come up further. To avoid risking a lower price or potentially not reaching an agreement, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  This ensures I meet my minimum price and secure the sale."
