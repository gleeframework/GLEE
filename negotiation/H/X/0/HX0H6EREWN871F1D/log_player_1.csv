Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A price of $2,000,000 significantly exceeds your minimum but is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Bob. This allows you to gauge his interest and willingness to pay a premium.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident and persuasive language, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. You should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. Your goal is to maximize profit while ensuring the deal doesn't fall through, leading you to sell to John at the lower price."
