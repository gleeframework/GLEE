"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can find some common ground with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,500? That would be a great price for me and would help me finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to a deal, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'll see if I can meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
