"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $12000, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $13000 is the best price. I'm willing to pay up to $12000, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
