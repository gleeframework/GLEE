"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item at a price that I think is very competitive. Given the value you've expressed for the product, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits and value this item can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $1,400,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and you ending up paying John's price outweighs the potential savings."
