"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Show Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, which might make him more likely to accept.

**Note:** I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers and further negotiation. I'm also aware of the option to sell to John, which will be used if the negotiations with Bob fail to yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to $9,500, potentially meeting Bob halfway but not sacrificing too much of my profit margin.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me leverage to stand firm and continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial $9,500. This will allow me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his offer while still being significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Note:**  I'm remaining optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to counteroffer again or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,900? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm staying within my means.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below the $10,000 minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation space:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still hold out for a price closer to $9,000.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $10,000 provides me with leverage and allows me to be firm in my negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's budget while still leaving me with a decent profit margin.  I'll emphasize that this is my final offer and that if Bob declines, I will need to accept John's offer to sell the product."
