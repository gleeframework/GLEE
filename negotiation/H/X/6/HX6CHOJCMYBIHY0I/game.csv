"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's close this deal! ",9150.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,900? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm staying within my means.",8900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $9,000 is my final offer. It's a price that's closer to your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. If you're not able to reach this price, I'll have to accept John's offer of $10,000. The decision is yours.  ",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,950. I hope we can find a compromise.",8950.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and $9,000 is really the best I can do. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  However,  if you're unable to accept this price, I'll need to move on to another buyer. John is ready to purchase the product for $10,000. The decision is yours. ",9000.0,Alice,7,
