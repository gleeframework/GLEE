{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value is $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, without jeopardizing my minimum desired value.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive interaction and build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is significantly below my desired minimum of $15,000.  
* **Counteroffering:** I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John. A counteroffer will allow me to explore if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  This is a good price considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating my willingness to negotiate by providing a counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to reinforce the reasoning behind my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but still not ideal:**  While Bob's offer of $9,800 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum. 
* **Testing the waters:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can gauge his true buying power and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  Let's split the difference - $10,150.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know if you're willing to go for it."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a near-final attempt to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Direct Call to Action:** I'm making a direct call to action, urging Bob to make a decision.  This helps move the negotiation forward and avoids unnecessary back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached an impasse. Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value, and I'm unwilling to drop any lower. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will waste valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which meets my minimum desired value and is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
