"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work for me.  Would you consider $950000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to consider $975000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
