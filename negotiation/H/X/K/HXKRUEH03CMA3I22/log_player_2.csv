You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's actual value, Bob can do better. He can try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work for me.  Would you consider $950000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, he can still get a better deal.  He can try to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to consider $975000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $975,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial price, it's still above his ideal budget. He can get the product for a much better price from John, so he chooses to buy from John."
