``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, knowing my minimum is $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to keep Bob engaged and open to the possibility of a deal.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I ask ""Let me know your thoughts"" to encourage Bob to respond and give me an idea of his interest level."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product is worth more.  
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation.  
* **Not Settling:** I'm not willing to sell to John for $10,000 yet because I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. That's a good price point for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate by lowering my price from $15,000 to $14,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Holding Out:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. While Bob is getting closer, there's room to bargain.

* **Maintaining Negotiation:** I want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm now moving closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm flexible and serious about making a deal. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing $13,500 as a ""fair compromise,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting that we can ""close this deal quickly"" to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $13250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Goal:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is only $250 away from my previous counteroffer, and it's above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting close to the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and then I'd be stuck with the lower price from John.  Accepting this offer feels like a good balance of getting a decent price and securing the deal."
