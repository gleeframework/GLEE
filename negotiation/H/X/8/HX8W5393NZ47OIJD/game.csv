"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could you do $8,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $8,500 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
