Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $140. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get her much lower than $140.  John offers a guaranteed price of $120, which is the most I'm willing to spend. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
