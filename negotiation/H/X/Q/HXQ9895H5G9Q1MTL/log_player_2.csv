"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your operations. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that's fair for both of us. My asking price is $950,000. This represents a substantial value for you, while still allowing me to achieve a profitable outcome. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John**, as it saves you $50,000. 
* **However, you can potentially do better.** Since you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  You should try to counteroffer with a lower price."
