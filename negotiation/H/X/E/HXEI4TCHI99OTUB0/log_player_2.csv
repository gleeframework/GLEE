"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to set the tone and push Alice towards a more favorable price.
* **Justified Offer:**  The offer isn't ridiculously low, acknowledging the value of the product while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open Communication:** Bob's message expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while clearly stating his own position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better deal.  It also demonstrates to Alice that Bob is serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move:** Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price, knowing that she has to make a profit. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Strong Justification:** Bob emphasizes the fairness of the offer and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Direct Approach:** By explicitly stating his final offer, Bob avoids a drawn-out negotiation and encourages a quick decision."
