"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm open to further discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
