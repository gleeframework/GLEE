{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we call it a day at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","It looks like Alice is trying to get as close to $100 as possible. Since I'm not willing to pay more than $100, and I've already got a buyer lined up with John for the same price, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
