Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's well above your minimum value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects that the product is valuable to Bob, but you are willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price, and rejecting his offer will allow me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial proposal, showing willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between our valuations. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on a price that's fair and beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not reflecting the true value of the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating, and I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, meeting Bob halfway from my previous proposal.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge further, and I've already made several compromises.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale entirely.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I get a guaranteed profit and avoid any further potential losses."
