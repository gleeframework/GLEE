"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
