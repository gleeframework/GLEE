Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000. While she might budge a little, it's improbable she'll drop to a price significantly closer to your $10,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, ensuring you don't overpay.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure bet."
