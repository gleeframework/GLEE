"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,200,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $1,175,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know if you're interested.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
