Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You secure a significant profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price."
