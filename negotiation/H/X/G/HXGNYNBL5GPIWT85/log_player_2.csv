"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your $1,500,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the $800,000 value it holds for Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
