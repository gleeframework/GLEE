Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it represents a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from him in the subsequent rounds. Accepting ensures I make the desired profit."
