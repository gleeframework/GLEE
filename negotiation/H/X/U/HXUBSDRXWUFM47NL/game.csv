"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you a significant return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it represents a good value for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
