"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is offering you the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay and the same price John would charge. There's no room for negotiation. 

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **No incentive to accept:** Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at the highest price you're willing to pay.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While it's not guaranteed, there's a slim chance Alice might come back with a lower offer if you reject this one.  She might be bluffing about John.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Alice will stick to her price, and you'll end up having to buy from John for the full amount."
