"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by proposing a price that is closer to your budget but still leaves room for further negotiation. It also acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing your price limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $150 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I'm still within the 10 rounds allowed, and I can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued negotiation while staying close to my budget. It is a moderate increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway while still keeping a reasonable margin for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $145. Let's close this deal. It's a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down again, $145 is still outside my budget of $100. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Alice, and I'm still hoping to get a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates continued negotiation while staying firm on my budget limit.  I've increased my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I've still kept it under $145.  It also highlights the potential for both of us to get a good deal."
