"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  I'm happy to pay $10,000 for it.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
