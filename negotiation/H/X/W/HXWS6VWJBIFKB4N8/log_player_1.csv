"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold strategy, but it allows for room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to what I want.  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm not yet willing to settle for that. I'm going to try to see if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000.  I still have 9 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than my target price,  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher price. $9,200 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
