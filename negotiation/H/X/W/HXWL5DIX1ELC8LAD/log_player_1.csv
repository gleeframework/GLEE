Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a reasonable offer that should be attractive to Bob, while still giving me a decent profit margin. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $820,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll consider my options.

As the seller, I'm not thrilled about selling the product for $820,000, as it's a significant discount from the original price. However, I'm not willing to walk away from the deal entirely. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my original price. Since Bob was willing to pay $820,000, I'll increase my offer by a smaller amount to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $840,000}

This is a reasonable compromise, as it's still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but not as high as my initial offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $825,000. This is getting closer to my original price, but I'm still not willing to sell at this price. I'll consider my options:

As the seller, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price, but I'm not willing to give up entirely. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price. I'll send another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my original price."
