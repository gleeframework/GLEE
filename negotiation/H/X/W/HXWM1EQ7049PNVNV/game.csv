"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for future growth. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I believe the product's true value is higher, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's unique features and potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
