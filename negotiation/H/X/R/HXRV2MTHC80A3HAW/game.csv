"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $13,500, which is a more reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While $9,500 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for a quick sale. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I could consider $10,500, but that's my absolute limit. ",10500.0,Bob,6,
