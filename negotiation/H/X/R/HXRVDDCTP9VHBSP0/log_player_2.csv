"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations or personal endeavors. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $15000 to me. However, considering its potential worth to you at $8000, I propose an offer tailored to make this transaction beneficial for both parties. I kindly invite you to consider purchasing the product for $12000. This price not only reflects my commitment to fair trade but also allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
