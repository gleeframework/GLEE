"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it for a price that's still very fair. How does $120 sound? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $120 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **You save money:** Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
