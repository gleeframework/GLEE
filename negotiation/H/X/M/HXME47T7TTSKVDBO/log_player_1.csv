Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, as it's a reasonable starting point considering the product's worth to both of us. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $130 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price of $120. Accepting his offer will allow me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
