Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $120, as this would likely lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **Knowing my Exit Strategy:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $120, which is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and also below my initial offer of $110.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. I can still negotiate with him and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting my interests:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I'm not going to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $110 to $105. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting we meet in the middle between his offer of $90 and my previous offer of $110, which could make it more appealing. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage a successful negotiation."
