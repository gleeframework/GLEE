Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $200) is likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer.  A price of $135 is a reasonable markup that Bob might still consider.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of just stating the price, the message emphasizes the ""value"" the product provides, subtly justifying the cost.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
