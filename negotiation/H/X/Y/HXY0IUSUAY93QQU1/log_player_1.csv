{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  I'm positioning the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to get him to accept.
* **I'm prepared to negotiate.**  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counteroffer, but I also have John as a backup buyer to ensure I get at least $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to consider. I'm better off counter-offering or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $9,000:** This is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,500.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Friendly and encouraging message:** The message is polite and continues to frame the negotiation as a mutually beneficial process. 
* **""Meet me halfway"" phrasing:** This emphasizes the compromise and makes it more likely Bob will be receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,200?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $8,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,200 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $8,500? This would be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $8,500:**  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm trying to push Bob closer to my desired price point.
* **""Middle ground"" phrasing:** This emphasizes the compromise and makes it more likely Bob will be receptive to the offer.
* **""Great deal for you""  and ""happy to close the deal"" phrasing:** This highlights the positive aspects of the offer for Bob, making it seem more attractive.

**Strategy:**

I'm getting close to selling to John, so I'm becoming less willing to compromise.  However, I'm still hoping to reach a deal with Bob, as it's more profitable for me. This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap."
