"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer. I'm also not going too high, as I don't want to scare him off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $140. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good price and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for less."
