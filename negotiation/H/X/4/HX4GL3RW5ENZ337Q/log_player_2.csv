The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking $150. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice is getting closer to your price, $130 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget at $130. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. How about we say $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still asking more than you're willing to pay, and it's clear she's not willing to go lower than $135. Since John is willing to sell the product for $120, it's better to just buy from him."
