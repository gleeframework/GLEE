"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. I believe that's still a fair price for both of us considering the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $700,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm now willing to go as low as $725,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
