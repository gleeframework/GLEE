"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,150,000. This offers a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very attractive price for a product of this caliber.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000.  This seems like a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
