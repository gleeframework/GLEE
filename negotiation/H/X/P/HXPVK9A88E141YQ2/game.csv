"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000. This amount reflects what I believe is a fair valuation based on my needs and resources. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to recoup a significant portion of the product's inherent value. To be fair to both of us, I'm prepared to accept $900,000.  This price point allows for a profitable transaction while remaining within a reasonable range for your budget. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
