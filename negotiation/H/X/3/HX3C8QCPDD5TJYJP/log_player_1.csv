"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer. I'm confident the product is worth more than $8,000 to me, so this offer is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can do better. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $9,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $9,000."
