"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you since it's more than what you'd get from John. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit over my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $1,325,000. This would be a great deal for you as it's a significant amount more than what you'd get from John. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
