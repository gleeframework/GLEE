"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
