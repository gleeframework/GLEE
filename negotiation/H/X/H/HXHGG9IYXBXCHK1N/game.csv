"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
