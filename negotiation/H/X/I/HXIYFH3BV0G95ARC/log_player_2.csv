"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,000. It's worth every penny and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is within his maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Significant reduction:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a significant price reduction.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates Bob is open to further discussion and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still slightly above Bob's budget.  Even though this offer is closer to Bob's target, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can achieve his goal of paying $10,000 or less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product and would be happy to pay $10,000 for it. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob is signaling this is his final price point.  This increases the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Fair price:** Bob emphasizes the value of the product and how his offer is a fair compromise.
* **Target price:** This offer meets Bob's maximum budget, aiming to achieve his desired outcome."
