"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product and would be happy to pay $10,000 for it. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
