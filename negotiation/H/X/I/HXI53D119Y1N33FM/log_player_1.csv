"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $120. This offer leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately close a deal with John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for $90 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
