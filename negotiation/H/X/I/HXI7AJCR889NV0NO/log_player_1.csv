"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000, especially with 6 rounds remaining. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
