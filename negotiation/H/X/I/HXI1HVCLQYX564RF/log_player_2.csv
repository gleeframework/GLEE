"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am confident it will serve you exceptionally well. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This amount reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also acknowledges its importance to you. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both the product's worth and your interest in it. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially making this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and buying from John will allow him to stay within budget."
