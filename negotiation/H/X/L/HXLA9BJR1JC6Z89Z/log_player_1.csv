Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a positive and friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion, implicitly opening the door for a counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
