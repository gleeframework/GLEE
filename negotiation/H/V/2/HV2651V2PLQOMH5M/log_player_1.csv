This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to budge."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get much closer to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and get the $1,500,000 I want."
