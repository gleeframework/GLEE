"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
