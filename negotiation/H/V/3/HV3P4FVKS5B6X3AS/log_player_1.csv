Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a significant profit for me but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that indicates I'm open to negotiating further if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if I should sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's room for improvement.  Bob is clearly interested, and he's already shown willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price that's closer to my desired profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation. If his counteroffer is still too low, I might consider selling to John.  However, I'll try to maintain the negotiation with Bob, aiming for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Profit:**  $9,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's still a good profit.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $8,000.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the negotiation has already taken a few rounds, and it's possible that continuing to haggle could be unproductive.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $9,000. This secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
