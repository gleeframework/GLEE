"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it, considering its value and benefits. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still significantly below what the product is worth. How about $110? That's a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm trying to keep my budget below $100.  Could we agree on $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $95 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference and go with $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $98.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",98.0,Bob,8,
