"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. My counteroffer for the product would be $820000.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing discussion,  $820000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to compromise, but I need to see a higher price to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $900000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $850000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest.  $850000 is closer, but still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm only prepared to go down to $875000. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I may need to consider other offers.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not comfortable with your current offer.  To close this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $870000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll need to move on to other options.",870000.0,Alice,7,
