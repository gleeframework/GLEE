"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($80). This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
