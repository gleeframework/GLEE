"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, Bob! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** Buying from Alice at $900,000 saves you $300,000 compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Within Budget:** $900,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum budget. 

While Alice might be making a profit, securing the product below your maximum budget is a win."
