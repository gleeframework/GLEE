"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement here.  What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
