Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** This gives Bob a chance to counter without feeling like he's being immediately rejected. It also allows me to gauge his interest level. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also much lower than my initial offer of $9,500.
* **John is a Better Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. This is a much more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's low offer.
* **Negotiation Continues:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process. I can use this opportunity to try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Higher than Bob's:** My counter-offer of $8,500 is higher than Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows I am willing to negotiate, but not at a loss to myself.
* **Compromise Approach:** $8,500 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer of $9,500 but also leaves space for further negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is phrased in a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing a desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $10,000 minimum. 
* **Risk of Settling Too Low:** If I accept, I risk losing out on a higher offer from John.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown he's willing to compromise, and I can likely get closer to my goal with another counter-offer. 

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  My counter-offer is $8,250, which is a smaller increment than my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the compromise we're both making, hoping to create a sense of fairness.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  The message uses a positive tone and avoids sounding demanding.  I express confidence in reaching a deal. 

By offering $8,250, I'm staying firm on my minimum while also demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."
