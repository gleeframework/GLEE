Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is getting close to our limit.  At this point, it's likely worth accepting and securing the product rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a good deal. We can still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
