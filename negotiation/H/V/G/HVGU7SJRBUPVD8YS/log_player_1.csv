"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This allows for room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum of $15,000, so I'm going to reject it.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay above my minimum value.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $16,500? This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John would also be an option, but this deal is already at my minimum price."
