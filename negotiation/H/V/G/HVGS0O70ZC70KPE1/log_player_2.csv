"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is better than John's price of $1,500,000, but it's still above what the product is worth to Bob. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I think that's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000 and John is offering the product at that price.  It's also closer to his desired price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves him $400,000 compared to buying from John."
