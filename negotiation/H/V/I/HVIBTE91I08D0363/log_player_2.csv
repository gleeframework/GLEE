Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential benefits to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $12,000 is still above your budget. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
