"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is my maximum limit. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential benefits to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $10000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
