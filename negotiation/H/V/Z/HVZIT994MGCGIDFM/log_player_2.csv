"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is above Bob's $10,000 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  There are also 9 more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I recognize the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the time and effort I've invested in preparing it.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's limit of $10,000.  Bob has already demonstrated he's willing to negotiate, and there are still 7 rounds left to potentially reach a better agreement."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me and the effort I've put into preparing it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still slightly above Bob's limit.  There are still 5 rounds remaining.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there's a chance he can push for a lower price or reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is closer to my budget,  I'm still hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm happy to offer $10,600 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,700. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,700 is still above Bob's budget.  While there are a few rounds left, the likelihood of Alice dropping her price further seems low.  With only three rounds remaining, it's a risk to continue negotiating, as Bob might not be able to reach his target price.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's desired price of $10,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from John at this point."
