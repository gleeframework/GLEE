"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I recognize the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the time and effort I've invested in preparing it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800.

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is closer to my budget,  I'm still hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm happy to offer $10,600 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",10600.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,700. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for both of us.",10700.0,Alice,7,
