"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob. 
* Bob has 10 rounds and can counteroffer, potentially getting a better price.
* Buying from John for $15,000 is a worse option than negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $14,000.
* This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* It's still a better price than buying from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial price of $14,000. 
* Bob has already made a counteroffer and Alice has rejected it, indicating that she might be firm on her price.
* Buying from John for $15,000 is a worse option.
* There are still 7 rounds remaining, but continuing to negotiate might not yield a better price, and it risks the deal falling through entirely. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and doesn't risk losing out to John."
