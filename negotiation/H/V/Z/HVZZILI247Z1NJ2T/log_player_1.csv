"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport with Bob, which is important in a negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** While I'm aiming for $12,000, I'm not completely inflexible. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have John as a backup. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Value of the product:** I'm aware of the product's worth to me and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $12,000, but still acknowledging his counteroffer. I'll aim for a compromise, but not a drastic price drop."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining hope:** I'm still hopeful that I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and see if we can reach a compromise. If not, I'll need to weigh whether to lower my price again or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to $11,000 and try to reach a compromise.
* **Jhon is a backup:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have John's offer as a safety net.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than $11,000, maybe $10,800, to show that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant about the price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm prepared to accept $10,800 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $11,000 to $10,800, showing flexibility without significantly compromising my own value.
* **Reiterate Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Final Offer Tone:** This counteroffer is worded to suggest that I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my final offer.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects, I will have to weigh the risks of further negotiation against the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $10,600. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Is this something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $200 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to settle for John's offer, which is significantly less appealing. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  While it's my minimum, I can potentially still counteroffer Bob again if he rejects.  I might be able to get him to budge a bit more.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. It's a good price, and it's better than risking losing the sale altogether."
