Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate down a bit.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That seems fair, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum value. While I'd prefer to make a bit more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the deal entirely. John offers a guaranteed $80, which is a good outcome for me."
