Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
