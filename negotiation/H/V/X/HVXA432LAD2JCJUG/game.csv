"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Could you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $113. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad you're willing to come down in price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $109? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $109 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $111? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",111.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not comfortable with $111. How about $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",108.0,Bob,8,
