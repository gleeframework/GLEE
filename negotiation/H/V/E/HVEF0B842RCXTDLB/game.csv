"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $7,750? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
