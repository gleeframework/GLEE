"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I think you'll really appreciate. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $8500 for it. This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
