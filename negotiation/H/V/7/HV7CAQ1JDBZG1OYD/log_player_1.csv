Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to make the offer appealing and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating my willingness to discuss the price, inviting Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.  
* **John is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed alternative with John, so there's no rush to accept a price that's not satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight concession from my initial offer ($175) but still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **No Further Room:**  I've already made a concession, and I'm hesitant to go lower.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is offering my minimum price, guaranteeing I won't lose money. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Further negotiations could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better price. 

It's more efficient to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed profit."
