"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good middle ground, leaving room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering $105. This is still a decent profit for me and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, I'm starting to run out of time.  Accepting $90 is a better deal than selling to John, and it's possible Bob won't budge further."
