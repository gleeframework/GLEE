Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still ensuring you get more than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $120 might discourage Bob, making him feel like there's no room for negotiation. A slightly lower price increases the chances of a successful sale."
