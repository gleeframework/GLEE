"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'd like to propose a compromise at $13,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle this right now for $14,250?  That's my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,250, which would be $13,875. That's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",13875.0,Bob,6,
