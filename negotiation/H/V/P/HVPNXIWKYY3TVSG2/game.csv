"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've highlighted. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  The value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a more realistic middle ground considering the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still firm on my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to make this deal work, but I can't go any higher.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
