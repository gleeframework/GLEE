"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is closer to what it's worth to me, and also gives you a good profit margin.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.
