Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This product is worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I highlight the potential value for both of us, and also leave the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a profitable deal:** The initial price is high enough to potentially maximize profit, yet leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I avoid immediately resorting to selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:** This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation that may lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a higher price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** In the next round, I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. This will maintain some leverage while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Sell to John as a last resort:**  If negotiations fail to reach a mutually acceptable price, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $900,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm offering a compromise that allows for both of us to potentially gain something from the deal.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** The counteroffer is a move towards Bob's price while still being above his initial offer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By refusing to accept Bob's offer immediately, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  This counteroffer opens the door for more back-and-forth and potentially allows us to find a mutually beneficial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** This keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter with a higher price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** In the next round, I'll aim for a price closer to my previous offer of $900,000. This will demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while maintaining some leverage.
* **Sell to John as a backup:** If negotiations continue to stall, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
