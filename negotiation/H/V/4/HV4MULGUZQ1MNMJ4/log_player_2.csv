# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's offer is still within your price range, but it's closer to your maximum than you'd like.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to your desired price of $75.  You can also use the fact that you're willing to buy from John for $120 as leverage."
