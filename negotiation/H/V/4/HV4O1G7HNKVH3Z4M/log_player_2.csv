Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you that I need to make a profit, and $8,000 is still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. I can offer you the product for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

```

Explanation:

Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000. She's made it clear that this is about her profit margin.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice.  You'll save $1,000 by going with John."
