,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  It's a good product, but I need to make sure it makes sense for my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $850,000?  That's a significant investment for me but shows I'm serious about making a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but the price still needs to come down a bit. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,7,
