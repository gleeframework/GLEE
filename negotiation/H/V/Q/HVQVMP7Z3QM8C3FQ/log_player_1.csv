Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I am  expecting Bob to counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired $10,000.
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John as a backup in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Bob is interested in the product, which means there's room for a counteroffer that could get us closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $7,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too much, to show I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob again to try to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm expecting Bob might counteroffer again, but I'm closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping John in mind:** If Bob doesn't come up, I can still sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We've gone through several rounds, and the gap between our prices is not shrinking significantly.  
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $10,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed higher-priced option."
