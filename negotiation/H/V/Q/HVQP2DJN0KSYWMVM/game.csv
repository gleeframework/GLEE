"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $160 is still a bit high for me. How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, and I'll sell the product to you for $150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
