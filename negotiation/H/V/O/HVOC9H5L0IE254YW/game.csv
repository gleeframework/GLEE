"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still allowing for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing me to stay within my budget while ensuring you receive a significant profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
