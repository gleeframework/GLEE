"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can pay. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still too high.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
