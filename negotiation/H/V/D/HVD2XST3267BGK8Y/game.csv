"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product's value to me is lower than what you're asking, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay the full $800,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $780,000. I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To make this work, I'd be willing to accept $790,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know your final decision.",790000.0,Alice,5,
