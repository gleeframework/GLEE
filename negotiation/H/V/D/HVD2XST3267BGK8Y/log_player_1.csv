"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product's value to me is lower than what you're asking, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $750,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay the full $800,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $780,000. I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

While $780,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob before considering selling to John."
