Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 from John, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum of $80."
