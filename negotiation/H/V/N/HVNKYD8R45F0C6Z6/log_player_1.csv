{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like this is a good opportunity.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to make Bob think it's worth the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll either counter with a lower price (but still above $1,200,000) or consider selling to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

While I'm interested in selling to Bob, accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about $1,100,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to ensure a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Tone:** I'm using a  tone that suggests I'm willing to compromise, but not drastically.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting its value for Bob.
* **Target Price:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Negotiate further:**  If he counteroffers closer to $1,100,000, I'll continue the negotiation.
* **Sell to John:** If his counteroffers remain too low, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to avoid a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll likely counter with a price slightly lower than $1,100,000 but higher than $950,000.  If Bob's counteroffers remain too low, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a fair profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This price would allow both of us to achieve a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting that it's a fair deal for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he counteroffers close to $1,025,000, I'll be willing to continue negotiating. If he continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll likely sell the product to John to avoid a substantial loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my maximum budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much for a sale. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  However, if his counteroffers remain too low, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to avoid a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or move on.
* **Significant Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this price represents a substantial compromise on my part, making Bob feel like I'm making an effort. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I've shown flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum."
