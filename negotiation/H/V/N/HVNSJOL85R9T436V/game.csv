"Alice, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 right now.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000, but that's still a bit more than I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1100000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
