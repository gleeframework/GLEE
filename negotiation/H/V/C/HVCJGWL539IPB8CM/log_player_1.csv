Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower than John's offer might secure a quicker deal with Bob. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $950,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $1,000,000 goal."
