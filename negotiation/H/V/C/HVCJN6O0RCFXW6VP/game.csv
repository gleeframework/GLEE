"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $120 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!",110.0,Alice,5,
