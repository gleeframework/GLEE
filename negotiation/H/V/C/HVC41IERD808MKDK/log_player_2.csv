"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer of $14,000 allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value at $13,800. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the product's value to her. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There are still many rounds remaining, and Bob is in a good position to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,800 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while showing flexibility. It is a small decrease from Alice's last offer, but it demonstrates that Bob is still determined to get a better price.  It's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but not at an unreasonable cost."
