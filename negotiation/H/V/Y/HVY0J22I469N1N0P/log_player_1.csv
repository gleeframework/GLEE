"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) and above what the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" allows Bob to express his interest and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always sell to John for $100, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great price for this amazing product, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $110 to $90, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is still above my minimum price and a good starting point for further discussion.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it's ""amazing"" and ""a great price."" This reinforces the idea that he's getting a good deal.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $100 at this point.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is showing a willingness to compromise. This suggests we can still reach an agreement closer to my desired price.
* **John is always an option:** If this negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $100, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $77 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $85.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and persistence:** I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I reiterate the ""fair price"" for both parties to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Positive tone:** Using an enthusiastic tone like ""Let's make this deal happen!"" emphasizes my desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  How about $80? That's a fair deal and my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation potential:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed return:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is more than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower price outweighs the potential of a slightly higher offer from Bob."
