"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,200 is a good price, it's not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,800 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,400?",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet at $8,600? That's closer to your offer, and it gives me a little more to work with. Let me know if that's something you can agree on.",8600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for the best price, and I appreciate that. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is a fair compromise considering where we both started. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal.",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,700. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",8600.0,Bob,8,
