"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $9,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a great opportunity to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* **Negotiation:** Alice has already come down from $9,500 to $9,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John at $10,000 is the alternative, and $9,000 is a better deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is the most logical choice."
