"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $75 is better than nothing, I can still do better.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting my minimum price.  While I might have preferred to sell for more,  it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
