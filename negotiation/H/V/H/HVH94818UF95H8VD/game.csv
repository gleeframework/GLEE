"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget. How about $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I understand $9,500 is your bottom line, but I have to stick to my budget. I can do $7,500.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
