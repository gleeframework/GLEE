{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique features and the significant value it can bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price acknowledges your concerns while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still within the first half of the rounds and I'm confident that I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 reflects a good compromise for both of us.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you to make a profitable investment. I'm confident this price will work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal,  Bob's offer of $910,000 is a good deal. We've negotiated for a few rounds now, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's important to close the deal, and I can always try to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
