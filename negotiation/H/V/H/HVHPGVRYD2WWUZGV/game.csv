"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique features and the significant value it can bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price acknowledges your concerns while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 reflects a good compromise for both of us.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you to make a profitable investment. I'm confident this price will work for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
