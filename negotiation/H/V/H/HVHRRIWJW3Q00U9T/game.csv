"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,250,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and remains within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
