Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can potentially do better. I'll counter-offer to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8750?  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,500, and given that John will only offer $8,000, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
