"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is a starting point that sets a high price for the product. It is a strategic move to assess Bob's interest and gauge his potential willingness to pay. It also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's a good middle ground and hopefully will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I still believe there's a chance to close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise that shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible but still maintains a price point above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final, decisive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm starting to run out of time, but I believe there's still a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. With only a few rounds left, I need to be more aggressive.  This is my final compromise.  I hope Bob will accept and we can close the deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where there's not much room left for negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds remaining, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of a further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
