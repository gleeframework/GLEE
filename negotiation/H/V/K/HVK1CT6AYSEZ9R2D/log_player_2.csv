"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $115. It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is still within my budget and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price point. While I'm willing to pay up to $120, I want to keep pushing for a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $112 is still a good deal for me, but I'm hoping Alice will accept and we can close the deal.  If she rejects again, I'll have to consider whether to buy from John or continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down slightly, but her offer is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $120 with John, so it's still worth trying to negotiate a better price.  The risk is that if I keep rejecting, Alice may get frustrated and we might not reach a deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer and then re-evaluate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing continued willingness to compromise.  However,  I'm now offering the same price as Alice's original offer. If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John. This is a risky move, but if it succeeds, I'll get the product at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've been going back and forth for a while, and Alice is showing a stubborn streak.  Her offer is still higher than I want to pay. While I'm willing to pay $120, I've already rejected several of her offers.  It's likely that if I keep rejecting, she'll either refuse to negotiate further or increase her price again.  I've run out of time for negotiation; it's time to move on and purchase from John."
