"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $107.50 is still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $108.50. This is my final offer.",108.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $108.50, which would be $106.75. Can you consider that?",106.75,Bob,6,
