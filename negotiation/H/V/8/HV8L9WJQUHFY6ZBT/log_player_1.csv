Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $105 is better than his initial valuation of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $110. There's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $107.50 is still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $108.50. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 108.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $108.50, which would be $106.75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. The negotiations with Bob are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that I won't be able to get a better price from him. John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that sale."
