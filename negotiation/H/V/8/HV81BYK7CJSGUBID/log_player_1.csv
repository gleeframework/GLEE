Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I believe a price of $14,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so aiming close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's maximum price leaves room for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher final sale price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 ensures Alice won't be forced to accept anything drastically lower."
