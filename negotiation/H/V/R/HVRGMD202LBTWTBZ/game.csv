"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm ready to buy it today.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
