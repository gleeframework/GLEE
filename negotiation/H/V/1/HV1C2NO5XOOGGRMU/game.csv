"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15500, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this.  What do you say?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to compromise and counteroffer at $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
