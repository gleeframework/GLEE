"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $9,500 is just not going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,750. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,750 is still too low. I'm offering the product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,8,
