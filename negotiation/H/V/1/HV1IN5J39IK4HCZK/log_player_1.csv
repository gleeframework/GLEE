"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob and aiming for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm determined to get closer to my value, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to push for a better deal.  I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $9,500 is just not going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,750. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my goal than his previous offers, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have only 4 rounds left, and I am not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,750 is still too low. I'm offering the product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's highly unlikely I'll be able to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Bob's final offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired amount. Given the limited time and Bob's insistence on that price, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get the best possible outcome for my product."
