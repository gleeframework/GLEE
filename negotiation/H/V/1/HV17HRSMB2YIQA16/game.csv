"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous potential for your company. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in it, but also leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its potential while working for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
