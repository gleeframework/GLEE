"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. Since you have the option to get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is only $80,000 more than what John is selling the product for. It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product while still staying within your budget."
