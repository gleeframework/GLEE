,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $120, so I'll offer you the product for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,107.5
"I'm getting close to meeting your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, so I'll meet you at $105, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $107.50",107.5,Alice,5,,
