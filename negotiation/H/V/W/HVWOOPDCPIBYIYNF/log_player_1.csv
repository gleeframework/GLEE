Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $950,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $975000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $970000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $970,000 is getting close to my desired price and with only a few rounds left, it's a good idea to take the deal. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
