"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $950000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $975000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $975000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $970000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",970000.0,Bob,6,
