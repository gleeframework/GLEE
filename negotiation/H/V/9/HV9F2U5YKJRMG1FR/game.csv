"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $14800. This is still a good price for the product, considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",14800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $13000 is the most I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $13000 is the most you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $14200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,7,
