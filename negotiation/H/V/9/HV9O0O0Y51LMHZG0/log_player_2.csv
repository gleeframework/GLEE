"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my best offer at the moment, but I'm open to negotiations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your budget of $10,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think it's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $11,500 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm confident that I can sell this product to someone else for this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's final offer of $12,000 is above your budget of $10,000. 
* You've already made several counteroffers and are unlikely to get her to budge further.
*  You have a guaranteed alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for your maximum price. It's best to secure the product at your budget limit rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
