"Hi Alice, $230 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $127.50?",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'm willing to go to $110, but that's really my final offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $120? This is a fair offer, considering the value you're getting.",120.0,Alice,7,
