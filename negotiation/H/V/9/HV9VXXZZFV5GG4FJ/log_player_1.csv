Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a strong starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **It's friendly:** Opening with a positive message builds rapport.
* **It leaves the door open:** The message invites Bob to respond and start a conversation.

I'm aiming for a good middle ground between maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  I believe I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** $8,750 is still a good deal for me, and it's close enough to Bob's initial offer that he might be willing to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. At this point, I've already lowered my price twice and there's a good chance Bob won't budge further.  It's best to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John, as continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with nothing."
