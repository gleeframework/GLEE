"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value to Alice. It aims to anchor Bob's perception of the price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the goal is to maximize profit, the offer acknowledges the $1,000,000 fallback option with John. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's willingness to pay and setting the negotiation's tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and our desired outcome. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open.
* **Early Stage:** It's too early in the negotiation to accept an offer significantly below our target. We have time to try and steer the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the product's value is truly unique.  I could consider letting it go for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is showing flexibility by coming down from her initial offer but remains firm on the product's high value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's, aiming to lead the negotiation closer to Alice's target.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is and how much he's willing to budge from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased slightly, indicating reluctance to meet Alice closer to her price.
* **Time Advantage:** With several rounds remaining, Alice has the leverage to continue pushing for a better deal.
* **John as Backup:**  The option to sell to John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to maintain a firm stance with Bob.

**Strategy:** Alice should continue countering with decreasing increments, signaling her willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong position above $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product highly. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This reflects its true worth and gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Decreasing Increments:**  Alice is strategically reducing her counteroffer by smaller amounts, demonstrating movement but maintaining a firm stance.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer. 
* **Still Above Target:** This offer keeps Alice comfortably above her $1,000,000 minimum while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern of Small Increases:** Bob is consistently making very small incremental increases, suggesting he may be unwilling to move significantly closer to Alice's price.
* **Time to Apply Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, Alice needs to signal that time is running out and a better offer is needed to avoid losing the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** John's offer serves as a strong bottom line. It's time to signal to Bob that Alice is seriously considering other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your engagement in this negotiation, but to be frank, your counteroffers haven't reflected the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more move at $1,325,000. However, I have other interested buyers, and this offer is only valid for this round."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice is clearly communicating that this is her final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:**  A small concession is made to show flexibility, but it maintains a significant margin above John's offer.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning other buyers adds pressure and reminds Bob that Alice has alternative options if a deal isn't reached.
* **Time Constraint:**  Limiting the offer's validity to this round forces a decision from Bob, pushing him toward a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is a $300,000 profit for Alice, which is a significant gain. 
* **Finality:**  Bob has declared this his ""final offer,"" making it unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing Bob without a guarantee of securing a better deal with another buyer in the remaining rounds. 

**It's always best to end a negotiation on a positive note while securing a substantial profit.**"
