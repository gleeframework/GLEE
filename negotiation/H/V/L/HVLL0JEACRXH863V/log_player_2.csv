Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing a fair price. Let's start with $11,000 for the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.  
* **Exploring other options is beneficial:**  By rejecting, you can see if Alice is willing to lower her price significantly enough to be worth it. If not, you have the option to buy from John."
