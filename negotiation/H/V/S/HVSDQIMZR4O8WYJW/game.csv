,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. I can't go down to $105, but how about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $109?  That's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
