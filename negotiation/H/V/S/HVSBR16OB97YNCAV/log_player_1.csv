Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $100 as possible, but you also need to make the offer appealing to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so you need to offer it at a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage.

By offering the product at $90, you're:

1. **Creating a Win-Win:** Bob gets the product for $10 less than he values it, and you make $10 more than selling it to John.
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, potentially getting you closer to your desired $100."
