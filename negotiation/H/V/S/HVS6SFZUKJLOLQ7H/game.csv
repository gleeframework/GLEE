"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to the price you're willing to pay, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,900. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
