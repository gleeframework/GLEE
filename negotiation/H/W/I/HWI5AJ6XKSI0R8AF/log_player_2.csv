"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $950,000.  He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and Bob's maximum is $1,000,000.  There is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's maximum is $1,000,000, and Alice is at $900,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $875,000.  This shows my commitment to making a deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $890,000. This price allows for a fair profit while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and Alice is getting closer to his desired price. There is still a small gap, and Bob can potentially save more by continuing to negotiate. He can also factor in the risk of Alice walking away and then having to buy from John for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try to get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer to an agreement. While $890,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. I'd like to propose $880,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal happen, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I value your persistence and commitment. I am willing to consider a price of $885,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $885,000, which is only $5,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate might not get Bob a significantly better price.  Considering that John is offering the product for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $115,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal with Alice is high."
