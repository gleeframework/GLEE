"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Showing Interest in Bob:** I'm framing it as if I think the product is valuable *to Bob* specifically, which might encourage him to consider it more seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is phrased to invite a counter-offer and keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to push for a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $7500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $10,000 to $8,500.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to keep the conversation amicable. 
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum value of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the number of rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John for $8,000."
