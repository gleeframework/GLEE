{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still allows me a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere. 
* The goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still maximizing my own profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can work within a budget of $1100000. Would you be willing to consider this proposal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,175,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,175,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). 
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. I'm also framing this as a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my own interests. 
* It shows that I'm serious about a deal but also won't settle for a price too far below my minimum acceptable price. 
* It's a strategic move to put pressure on Bob to reconsider and potentially come closer to my price."
