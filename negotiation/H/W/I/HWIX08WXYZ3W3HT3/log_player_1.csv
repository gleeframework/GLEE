"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:**  While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it as having ""incredible potential"" might pique his interest and lead to a counteroffer closer to your target.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way beyond my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. While he's showing interest, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.  It's better to counter and see if you can negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the product's potential for a win-win situation."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still above both your floor and Bob's initial offer, this counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's potential and framing it as a ""win-win"" aims to keep Bob engaged and focused on the long-term benefits.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have John as a backup, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not advantageous. We'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it to me for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed crucial information: he knows about John and John's potential selling price. This puts you at a significant disadvantage. Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more than $1,000,000, which is still below your minimum. 

Given this new information, it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiations with Bob. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures you get your desired price without further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
