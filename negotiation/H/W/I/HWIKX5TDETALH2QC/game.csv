"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $11,000.  This is a final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10250.0,Bob,6,
