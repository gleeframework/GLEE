"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value while still providing you with a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
