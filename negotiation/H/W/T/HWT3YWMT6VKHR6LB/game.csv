"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $950,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential benefits, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my current financial constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,050,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope we can find a way to move forward.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
