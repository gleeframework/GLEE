I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives me a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and there's potential for further bargaining if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering $1,650,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm confident that he'll be willing to meet me halfway, especially since he's already shown interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my target price and I'm willing to take it.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss of a few thousand dollars."
