Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, close to Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. It aims to maximize my potential profit while acknowledging Bob's strong interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is now closer to my preferred price, and while it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a significant profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through. Selling to John would guarantee a lower profit."
