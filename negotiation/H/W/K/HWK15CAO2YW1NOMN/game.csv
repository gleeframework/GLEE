"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $900000 is outside my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $825000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $837500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",837500.0,Alice,5,
