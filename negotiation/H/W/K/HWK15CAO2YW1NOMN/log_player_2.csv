"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I have to inform you that I'm looking for a price of $900000 for this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so any price above that is a loss.
* Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is $100,000 more than Bob's maximum value. 
* It's worth negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $900,000 is outside my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still $50,000 higher than Bob's maximum value for the product.
* It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.
* John is still a viable option, but it's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before committing to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $825000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $837500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still $37,500 above Bob's maximum value for the product.
* While there are more rounds left, the negotiation seems to be stalling. Alice is unwilling to go lower, and Bob is unwilling to go higher.
* John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
*  It's more efficient to secure the product from John at his price rather than risking further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
