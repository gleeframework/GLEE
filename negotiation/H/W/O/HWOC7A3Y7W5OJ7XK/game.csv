"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000, reflecting both the product's value and the potential benefits you'll realize. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
