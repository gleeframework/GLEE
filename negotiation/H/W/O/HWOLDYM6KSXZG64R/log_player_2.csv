Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your latest offer. In response, I propose a price of $890000 for the product. This price aims to balance our interests and bring us closer to a satisfactory agreement.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $890,000, which is a good deal for me.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she might not budge further, and I could end up paying the full $1,000,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm happy with."
