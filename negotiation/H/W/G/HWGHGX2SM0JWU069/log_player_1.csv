Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
Reasoning: Bob's offer of $130 is higher than John's standing offer of $120. Accepting this offer maximizes profit at this stage.
