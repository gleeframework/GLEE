"I'm interested in the product, but $750000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $600000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $675000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $650000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to go down to $670000, which is as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $670000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $660000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",660000.0,Bob,6,
