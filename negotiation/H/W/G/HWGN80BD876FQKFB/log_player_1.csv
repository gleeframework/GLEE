Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, trying to sell to Bob first allows you to potentially make even more.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $950,000 is a high price, reflecting the product's value to you. However, it's still significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**This strategy aims to strike a balance between:**

1. **Attracting Bob with a price lower than John's offer.**
2. **Maximizing your profit by securing a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.**

This offer gives you the best chance of selling the product quickly and for the highest possible price."
