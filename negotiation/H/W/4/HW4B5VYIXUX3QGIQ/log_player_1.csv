Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this:

* **$200 is a good starting point:** It's above your minimum of $150, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open-ended:** This helps keep the conversation going and avoid immediately closing off Bob. 
* **It leaves the ball in Bob's court:** This makes him feel like he has some control over the negotiation, which can lead to a more positive outcome.

**Important:**  Remember, this is just the first step.  The key is to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses.  You'll need to decide if you want to lower your price, make counter-offers, or even walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $175?  I'm really interested in the product! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $175 is better than selling to John for $150, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to try for a higher price, which is ultimately what I'm aiming for. 

I will counter-offer with a price between $175 and my original $200.  This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $175 is still a little too low for me.  Would you consider $185?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 185} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $200.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $185 as a ""fair"" price, implying it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Open-ended:** The message ends with a question, prompting Bob to respond and continuing the negotiation. 

By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing I'm willing to work with Bob, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  The next step depends on Bob's reaction to this counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $185 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $180.  Let's see if we can make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counter-offer of $180 is just $5 less than my previous offer of $185.  At this point, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's likely that if I reject Bob's offer and try to counter again, he might either reject my counter or walk away from the negotiation completely.  

Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit significantly higher than selling to John.  It's a good compromise that secures a fair price without risking a potential loss."
