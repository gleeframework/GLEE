"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it holds significant value for you and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. My asking price is $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering the value you'll receive.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but  $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $975,000 to make this work for me. Let's close this deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. It's getting close, though. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, and I'm hoping you can meet me there.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,8,
