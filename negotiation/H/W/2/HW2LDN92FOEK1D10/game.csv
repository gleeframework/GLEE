"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $150, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $135 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $142.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
