You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's budget. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the best option."
