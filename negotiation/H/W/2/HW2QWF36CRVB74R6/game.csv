"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $110. That's my final offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
