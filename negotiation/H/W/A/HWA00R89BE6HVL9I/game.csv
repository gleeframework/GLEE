"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could greatly contribute to your success. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its significance, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. Would it be possible to adjust your offer to meet my budget?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between your proposed price and the true value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept such a low offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept an offer higher than $900,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both our positions?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your budget constraints. Let's make this work - how about we settle on $975,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledges your budget, while still reflecting the true value of this product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
