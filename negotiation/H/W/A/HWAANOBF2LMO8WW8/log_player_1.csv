"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation higher. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for the high price, focusing on ""value"" and ""return on investment"" to appeal to Bob's potential profit motive.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial high price gives me plenty of room to negotiate down during the remaining rounds while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product's potential, but I'm only willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  I believe this price is still fair, considering the value you've outlined. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than my minimum ($1,500,000) BUT it's too early to accept. I still have ample rounds to negotiate and aim for a higher price. Selling to John now would secure my minimum, but there's potential to get more from Bob.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the value, the product offers significant potential beyond that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer ($200,000 reduction) to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Bob's Offer:** I'm still aiming higher than Bob's offer ($1,400,000) to give myself room to negotiate further while staying above my minimum target.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's potential to justify the higher price.  
* **Seeking Compromise:** Framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This price is fair given the value we've discussed, and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is excellent:

* **Significantly Above Minimum:** It's $100,000 more than my guaranteed sale to John ($1,500,000) and well above Bob's initial offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** Bob's framing suggests he's put his best offer forward and is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Factor:** While I have rounds left, continuing might make Bob less willing. Accepting now secures a great deal."
