"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. To be fair to us both, I'm proposing a starting point of $1,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,150,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
