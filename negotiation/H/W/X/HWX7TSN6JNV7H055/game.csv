"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $6,500. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value you place on the product.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and counteroffer at $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'll have to go with a different seller.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $9,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
