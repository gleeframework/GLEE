"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While $102.50 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $98 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal happen.",98.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98.
