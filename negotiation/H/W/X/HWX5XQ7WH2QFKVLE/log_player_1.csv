Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair given its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being positive and encouraging, hoping to start the negotiation on a friendly note. I'm also highlighting the potential benefits of the product, which may persuade Bob to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** By starting at a higher price, I can potentially squeeze out a better deal than selling immediately to John.
* **Backup Option:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the power to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market rate. I'd like to hear back from you and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while still staying within my minimum acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $1,400,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while expressing my own need for a higher price. I'm also emphasizing the product's unique value to encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway, I show a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a position of strength.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable value, which is $1,500,000. This ensures I don't end up selling for less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.**  While he's willing to compromise, it's not enough to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **It's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will offer a price that I find acceptable.**  We're getting closer to my minimum value, but I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that's not satisfactory.
* **I'm better off selling to John for $1,500,000.** This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the potential for further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

While I initially tried to negotiate with Bob to potentially get a higher price, the negotiation process has reached a point where the risk of getting a lower price outweighs the potential for a better deal. Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable outcome."
