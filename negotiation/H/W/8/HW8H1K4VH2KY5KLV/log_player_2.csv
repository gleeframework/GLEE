"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob, and it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,700 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay right now. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has countered. This suggests there's still room for further negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, so rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue exploring those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still trying to keep the price lower than Alice's most recent offer. $9,000 represents a significant saving for Bob compared to John's offer and is close enough to Alice's price that there's a chance she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is a good price for Bob. It's still lower than John's offer of $10,000, and it's only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $9,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially failing to reach a deal is high.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
