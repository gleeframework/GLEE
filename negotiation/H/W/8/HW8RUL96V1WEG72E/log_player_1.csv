Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while maximizing potential profit.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message frames the offer as a ""great deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting. 
 
Let's see if Bob goes for it!"
