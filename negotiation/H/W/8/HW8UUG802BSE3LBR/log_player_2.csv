"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  Even though you have a maximum price of $15,000, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  

* **Counter-offering** gives you a chance to save even more money.
* **Buying from John** is your fallback option if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer was $12,000, and your maximum is $15,000.** This gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Offering $10,000** is a significant drop from Alice's price and a fair starting point for a counteroffer.  
* **This counteroffer reflects a desire to save money while remaining within your budget.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is $12,500, which is still less than your maximum of $15,000.**
* **It's unlikely that Alice will go lower, and you risk further negotiations.** 
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John.** 

While you could potentially try for a lower price, it's risky. Accepting Alice's offer is a good compromise that allows you to buy the product within your budget."
