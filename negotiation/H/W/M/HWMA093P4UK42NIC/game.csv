"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and agree on $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
