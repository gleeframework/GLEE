Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,650,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product and its potential for you is much higher. I'm ready to make my final offer: $1,350,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fantastic deal on a product that will generate significant returns for you.

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum budget and your alternative option with John.  There's no point in continuing negotiations if you are unwilling to pay more than $1,000,000."
