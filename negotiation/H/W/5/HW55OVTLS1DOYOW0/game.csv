"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $15000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14000. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $15400? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",15400.0,Bob,4,
