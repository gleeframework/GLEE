"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14000. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $15400? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,400 is very close to my desired price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price with him. It's also more than what I'd get from John. I'll accept his offer to avoid risking a longer negotiation."
