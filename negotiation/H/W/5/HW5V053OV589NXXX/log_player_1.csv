Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $145, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:**  The message highlights the value of the product and frames the price as a good deal.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  I'm willing to potentially negotiate down to $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. If Bob is willing to pay more, that's even better. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my price or consider selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target, potentially leading to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value.
* **Appealing Message:**  The message reaffirms my willingness to negotiate and highlights the value Bob will be getting.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $135 is a good compromise that leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I can either lower my price slightly or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I'm still unable to go above $120 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $120 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $150.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome, and I'm risking losing time and potentially losing the sale altogether. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick and easy transaction."
