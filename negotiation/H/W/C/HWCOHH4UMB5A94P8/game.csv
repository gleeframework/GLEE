"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a healthy profit while I secure a substantial portion of the value I place on this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a good deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920,000 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's settle this and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $915,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
