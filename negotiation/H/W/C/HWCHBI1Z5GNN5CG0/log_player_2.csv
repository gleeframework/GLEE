"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within your budget. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save the $250,000 difference."
