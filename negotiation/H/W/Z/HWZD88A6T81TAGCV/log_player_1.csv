Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential for me to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $12,000, which is still a good profit for me, but it's more likely to be accepted by Bob than my initial offer."
