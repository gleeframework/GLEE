"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $85?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is too low, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your offer of $85 and my previous offer? Would you be willing to sell for $72.50?",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $72.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $80, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
