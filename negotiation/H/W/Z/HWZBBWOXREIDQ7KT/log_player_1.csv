``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum ($120), but I'm also aware of the risk of losing the sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to avoid losing the sale altogether, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $85?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is too low, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your offer of $85 and my previous offer? Would you be willing to sell for $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $72.50 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $72.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $80, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
