"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can we meet at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,012,500. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
