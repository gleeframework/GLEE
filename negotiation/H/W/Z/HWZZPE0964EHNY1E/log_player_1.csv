"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to secure a deal quickly. However, I am aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price but still above my minimum value, hoping to incentivize Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident I can get a better price, considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I will counter again, hoping to push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,012,500. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  I don't want to risk running out of time and getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. John's offer is a sure thing, guaranteeing me my minimum value. It's time to secure the deal with John."
