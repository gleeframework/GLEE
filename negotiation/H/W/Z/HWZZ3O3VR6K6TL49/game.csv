Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a truly unique opportunity to own something of immense value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its rarity and potential returns on investment.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, based on my own assessment of its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 may be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the product's unique features and potential returns, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both parties. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering my research and the fact that I have another option for acquiring this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value and my initial offer of $900000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's potential returns.",825000.0,Alice,5,
