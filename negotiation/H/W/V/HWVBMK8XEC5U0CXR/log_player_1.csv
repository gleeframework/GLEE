{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leverage the fact that Bob might be willing to pay a little more to get the product. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not able to go as low as $90. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm trying to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $88 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, so I'm going to sell the product to him for $100."
