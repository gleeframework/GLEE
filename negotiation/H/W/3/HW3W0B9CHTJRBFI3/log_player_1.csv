Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Be polite and clear:** The message is friendly and straightforward, making it clear what I'm offering and inviting Bob to respond.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting an ultimatum, which gives Bob the chance to counter and potentially find a price we both agree on.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer and can always fall back to that if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob if I reject his offer and counter.  
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** My counteroffer lowers the price from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Stay above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This keeps me in a strong position.
* **Polite and open to compromise:**  The message remains polite and suggests a willingness to find a middle ground, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Still have John as a backup:**  My decision to counteroffer shows confidence in my ability to negotiate a better price with Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a higher price.  
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  I have John's offer to fall back on, which gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable agreement."
