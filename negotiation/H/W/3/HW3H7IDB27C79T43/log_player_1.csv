"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  I believe it holds tremendous value for you, potentially even more than I initially realized. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to anchor high, closer to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Acknowledging Value:** We subtly suggest the product might be worth more than Bob anticipates, subtly increasing its desirability. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language is collaborative, framing the initial price as a starting point for discussion rather than an ultimatum.

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, setting the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  Let's start with a price of $900,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a reasonable starting point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's a substantial drop from our initial ask.  Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to negotiate, but he's aiming low. We have room to maneuver and can likely secure a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you a substantial return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This approach signals flexibility and a desire to reach a fair deal, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential, subtly anchoring the price at a higher point.
* **Stronger Language:**  Instead of ""let's see if we can find common ground,"" we're more assertive with ""Let's meet halfway."" This demonstrates confidence in our position.

By countering with a strong but reasonable offer, we maintain our negotiating position while aiming to move the deal closer to a favorable close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit margin, exceeding our minimum acceptable price by $150,000. 
* **Upward Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to meet closer to our price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could potentially squeeze a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away increases with each counteroffer. It's better to secure a great deal now than risk losing him entirely."
