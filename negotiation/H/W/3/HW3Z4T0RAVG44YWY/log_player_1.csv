"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit above your minimum price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you are willing to be flexible and start the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we possibly settle for $110?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to the midpoint you offered in the previous round. While it's still less than you'd like, accepting this offer ensures a deal with Bob and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for less."
