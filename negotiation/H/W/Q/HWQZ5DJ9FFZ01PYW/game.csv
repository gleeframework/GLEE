"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This price still allows you a healthy profit margin, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to me. Can we meet at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
