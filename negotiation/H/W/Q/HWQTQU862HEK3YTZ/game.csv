"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate, but it's still a fair price considering the value of this product to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000, which is closer to your offer and allows me to move forward. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
