"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you can get the product from John for $1,200,000, Alice is offering it for $1,100,000.  This means you save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice.**  You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell it for less than that. This makes it a good deal for you."
