"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
