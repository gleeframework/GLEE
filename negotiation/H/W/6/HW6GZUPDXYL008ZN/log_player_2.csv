"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price range and gain leverage in the negotiation.

* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends on a positive note, expressing willingness to find a compromise and continue the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob has successfully pushed Alice down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. There's potential to negotiate further and potentially get closer to his target price. 
* **Jhon Option:** While Jhon offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000,  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm happy with the progress,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering we're both making concessions.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this number."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

* **Closing the Deal:** The message expresses optimism and a desire to close the deal at this price, hoping to create urgency."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. However, $1,075,000 is still out of my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,000,000,  which is the absolute maximum I can afford.

* **Jhon's Price is Secure:**  Jhon is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, guaranteeing a purchase at a known price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to more rounds and potentially higher prices, as she's shown a willingness to counteroffer even after rejecting Bob's final offer. 

It's time for Bob to secure the product at a guaranteed price from Jhon, avoiding further risk and uncertainty."
