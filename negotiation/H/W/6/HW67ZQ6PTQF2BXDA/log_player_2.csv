{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob. Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It is likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiations."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.  While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 7 rounds remaining and should continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying below his maximum price. $115 is a reasonable offer that might be more appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her last offer and might be closer to her desired price point."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still $25 higher. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob still has time to try and negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he won't go higher.  This offer is a bold move, as it puts the pressure on Alice to decide whether she wants to accept or risk losing the deal. With only 4 rounds left, it's a good time to make a definitive offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Buying from John at his fixed price of $120 guarantees Bob the product at his desired price point, without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
