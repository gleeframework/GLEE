{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm starting high, but leaving room for negotiation.  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but I know I have John as a backup offer at $100 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I know he values the product at $80, and I have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John.  I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that's where you're at right now, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm holding firm at my minimum acceptable price ($100) which is also John's offer. This puts the ball in Bob's court and lets him know I'm serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While it's not my ideal price, getting $90 from Bob is better than a guaranteed $100 from John if it means potentially dragging out negotiations further. It's a decent compromise."
