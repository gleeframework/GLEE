Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $13,000 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have room to go up if Bob counters, but you also have a plan B with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to earn.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob. You'll still have the option to sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It's close to your counteroffer and still significantly above your minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit for you while closing the deal. Selling to John would only yield a lower amount, so it's best to take Bob's offer."
