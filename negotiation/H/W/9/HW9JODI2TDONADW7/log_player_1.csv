Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, incorporating negotiation tactics:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  It's something I highly value, but I believe it could be even more beneficial in your hands. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's benefits and Bob's potential gain, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Create Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicit, the message hints at other potential buyers (""more beneficial in *your* hands"") without revealing John's lower offer. This might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Information Advantage:** This assumes you *don't* know Bob's exact valuation. If you did, you could push closer to $1,200,000.
* **Risk Tolerance:** A higher offer risks rejection, forcing you to accept John's lower price. A lower offer is safer but leaves potential profit on the table. 

This scenario highlights the balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
