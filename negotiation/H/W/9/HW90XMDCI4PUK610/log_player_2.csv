{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

I'm going to start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, but $5,500 is still a bit high. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly from the last round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  At this point, I'm comfortable accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiation.  It's still a good deal, and I want to make sure I don't risk losing out on the product."
