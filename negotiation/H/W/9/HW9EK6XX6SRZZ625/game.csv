"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $100 for this product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $155, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. If you're not willing to go down to $155, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",155.0,Bob,6,
