"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I highlight the potential gain for Bob, emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect. 
* **Confidence:** My message is confident and encourages a positive response. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  While I'm aiming for the best possible price, John's offer of $1,500,000 is my safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory price, I can always go with John.
* **Risk Assessment:**  This strategy carries some risk, as Bob might reject my initial offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk, as I'm aiming for the highest possible profit within a reasonable timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given the value of the product to me is $1,000,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While his offer is significantly closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's Offer:** While $1,500,000 is a good backup, I'm not desperate to sell at this point, as Bob's counteroffer suggests some willingness to pay closer to my value.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round.  I'll need to find a price point that balances my desire for profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value the product at significantly more, I'm willing to be flexible. I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to reiterate my position and keep the price above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message remains positive and encourages collaboration,  showing flexibility while still asserting my position. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  I'm carefully considering the potential risk of Bob walking away. However, I need to remain above my minimum acceptable price to make this deal worthwhile.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  His counteroffer suggests he's interested in the product.  I'm aiming to find a sweet spot that maximizes my profit while keeping him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. This makes it a very tempting option.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** We've already gone through three rounds of negotiation, and while I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and me losing the deal entirely is high.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is the same amount as Bob's, there's no guarantee that John wouldn't also negotiate in future rounds, potentially making the deal less profitable.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Time is Money:**  With only 6 rounds left, I'm prioritizing a quick deal over trying to squeeze out a few more dollars. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations is too high, given the potential for a stalemate or Bob walking away.  
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable outcome."
