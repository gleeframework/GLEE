Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through counteroffers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500.  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still a better price for me than his offer.  Hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  It's a better price than his previous offers and closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risks of Bob dropping out completely."
