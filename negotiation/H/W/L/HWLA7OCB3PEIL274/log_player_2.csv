"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe has significant value for your business. My initial price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the opportunity it presents for you. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the opportunity it presents."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $950,000 is still outside Bob's budget. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 is still a viable option. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible, but if she doesn't budge, Bob can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle. This price allows you to make a decent profit while giving me a chance to acquire the product. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  It seems we're getting closer, and I believe with a little more compromise we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $925,000 is still above his budget. Bob has shown that he is willing to negotiate, but he is also adamant about staying within his financial limits.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000, he is justified in rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate to try and get a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it allows you to make a substantial profit. I believe a little flexibility on your end will make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $917,500. This price allows us both to gain something from this deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.  We're so close to making this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting very close to Bob's desired price, $917,500 is still above his budget.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has been persistent in sticking to his budget. At this point, with only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at $800,000, ensuring he stays within his financial limits and doesn't risk further negotiation delays."
