{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe has significant value for your business. My initial price is $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the opportunity it presents. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle. This price allows you to make a decent profit while giving me a chance to acquire the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can push for a higher offer, especially with 6 rounds remaining.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target.  I still have the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  It seems we're getting closer, and I believe with a little more compromise we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it allows you to make a substantial profit. I believe a little flexibility on your end will make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $910,000 is tempting, I'm going to stick with my goal of getting closer to $950,000.  I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I still have 4 rounds left, and I can always go to John for $1,200,000 if necessary.  Let's see if I can push Bob a little further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $917,500.

We're so close to making this happen!"", ""product_price"": 917500}
