,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $115 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without going over budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
