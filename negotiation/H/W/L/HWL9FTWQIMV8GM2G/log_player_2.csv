Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still considerably below my bottom line.  I've received a compelling offer from another buyer.  To be completely transparent, I'm willing to finalize a deal with you for $925,000.  However, this offer stands only for the next 24 hours.  After that, I'll need to move forward with the other interested party.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's better to secure the product at a price we know is good than risk ending up with nothing."
