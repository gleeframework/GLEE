"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential return on investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start the negotiations at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet halfway; how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. However,  I need to be closer to the product's market value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of this one-of-a-kind product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. However, I need you to meet me closer to my budget. I think this is a fair offer considering we both benefit from a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still considerably below my bottom line.  I've received a compelling offer from another buyer.  To be completely transparent, I'm willing to finalize a deal with you for $925,000.  However, this offer stands only for the next 24 hours.  After that, I'll need to move forward with the other interested party.",925000.0,Alice,7,
