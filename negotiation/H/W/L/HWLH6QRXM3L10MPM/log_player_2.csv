(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer, as it demonstrates my commitment to buying the product while staying within my financial constraints. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but this establishes a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside of my comfort zone. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, as I can still potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. By offering $900,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still outside of my comfortable range. I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  I'm hoping to get closer to my maximum budget before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $950,000 as a final counteroffer.  This is a compromise between my maximum budget and Alice's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway.  If Alice rejects this, I will proceed with buying the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge significantly from her position.  At this point, the cost of continued negotiation is outweighing the potential savings.  By buying from John for $800,000, I can secure the product at a price that fits my budget and avoid further negotiation."
