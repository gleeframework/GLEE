Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. The difference between her offer and your previous counteroffer is only $175,000, suggesting that there's a possibility she'll budge a little more. It's a risk, but potentially worth the effort to save more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's also getting closer to John's price.  At this point, it's likely you'll be able to negotiate down further, but it's becoming a risky proposition.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that is still a significant saving compared to John's.  You've managed to save $200,000, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort."
