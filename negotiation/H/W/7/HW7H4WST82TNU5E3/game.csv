"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant price drop from my initial position, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
