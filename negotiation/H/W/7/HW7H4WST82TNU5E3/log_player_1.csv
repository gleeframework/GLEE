{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget, giving him incentive to consider the deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still leaving room for negotiation, but also ensuring you don't give away too much value.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  You're stating the price directly and giving Bob a clear call to action. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower your price slightly, but be prepared to walk away if you can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're still quite far apart in terms of value. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You can counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your desired range, perhaps around $1,050,000. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that you're not desperate for a sale."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a price closer to your desired range:**  This shows that you're open to negotiation, but not willing to give away too much value. 
* **Reinforces the product's value to Bob:** You mention the ""value you'll get from the product"" as a reminder of the benefits for him.
* **Calls for a compromise:** You suggest meeting in the middle, encouraging Bob to see this as a fair and mutually beneficial outcome. 

Let me know how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to your previous counteroffer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're still not close enough to a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer again:** You can make another counteroffer, but be cautious. This might be your last attempt before selling to John. You could offer a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $1,000,000, to see if you can find a middle ground.
* **Consider selling to John:** If you feel like the negotiation with Bob isn't going anywhere, you might want to consider selling the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed deal and meets your minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant price drop from my initial position, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This emphasizes that you're committed to reaching a deal, but there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** You reiterate the product's value to Bob to push him towards accepting.
* **Clear Call to Action:** You explicitly ask Bob to close the deal if he's serious. 

This counteroffer is a high-risk, high-reward play.  If Bob rejects, you're likely to sell to John.  However, if Bob accepts, you'll secure a price closer to your minimum acceptable price."
