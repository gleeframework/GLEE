"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $1800000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  To start negotiations, I'd like to offer $800000. This is my maximum budget for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  I'm eager to work with you, but I won't go higher than this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $1000000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1250000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which is just a small step away from your last offer. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but I can't go lower. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm prepared to offer $1125000 for the product. This is a very fair price considering our previous offers.  I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Let's get this done.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
