Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a fair price and me to acquire the product within my budget.
