"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm asking for $1,800,000 to start. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price ($1,800,000), significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to be positive and gauge Bob's initial reaction. His response will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's still room for negotiation. It's closer to his perceived value than mine, and I started high to allow for this. I'll counter in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. Proposing $1,650,000 keeps the deal above both our minimums and aims for a compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:**  By saying ""fair price for both of us,"" I'm reinforcing that this deal is mutually beneficial. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm flexible, I'm still holding firm above my minimum to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider a price closer to what you're suggesting. Let's aim for $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly above my minimum of $1,200,000 and provides a healthy profit. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
