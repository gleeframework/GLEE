{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $9,500 and even threatening to walk away.  While you could push further, there's a risk she'll follow through and you'll end up having to buy from John for $12,000. Accepting $9,500 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
