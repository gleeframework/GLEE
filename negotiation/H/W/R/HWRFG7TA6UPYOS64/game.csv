"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my minimum expectation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $850000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
