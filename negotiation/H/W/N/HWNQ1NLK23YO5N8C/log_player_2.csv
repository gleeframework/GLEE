"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its inherent value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It is worth trying to get the price down before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of this type of product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close the deal and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,150,000 is my ideal target, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer again. You are very close to your ideal price with John, and there is still room to negotiate with Alice. It is worth trying to get the price down a little more before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,090,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  I believe this price fairly compensates for the true value of the product. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it is best to buy from John. Alice has come down significantly in price, but you are still only $90,000 away from your ideal price with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could result in a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice walking away from the deal or making a counteroffer that is not as good as John's price.  It is better to secure the product at a price that is close to your goal."
