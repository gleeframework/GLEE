"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significantly Below Valuation:** My offer is significantly below both Alice's valuation and my own. This signals I'm serious but also leaves room for compromise. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This first counteroffer helps understand how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I could consider letting it go for $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Even with the reduction, the price is still significantly higher than my $800,000 limit and leaves little room for further negotiation towards a price I'd accept. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:**  By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about a much lower price and testing how willing Alice is to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm considering another option at $800,000.  If you can come down closer to that range, I'm still very interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning the other offer at my max price, I'm creating a sense of urgency and competition. Alice might be more willing to negotiate if she thinks she might lose the sale.
* **Direct and Transparent:** I'm being direct about my budget limitations and the alternative offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious and not just trying to lowball her.
* **Final Offer (for now):**  While framed as an option, I'm essentially presenting my maximum price. This puts the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to accept a significant price cut or risk losing the sale."
