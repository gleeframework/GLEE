Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without being explicitly dishonest) adds a time pressure element that might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation and that information about the other buyer (John) is not part of the negotiation tactics."
