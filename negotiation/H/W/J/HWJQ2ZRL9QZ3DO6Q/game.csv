"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we possibly settle around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers you considerable value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be open to a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still confident the product is worth more to you in the long run. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
