"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to make it clear I'm open to negotiation and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price.  
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer gives me leverage to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a little low for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $95 is a reasonable compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and there's a good chance Bob won't budge further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is more than what Bob is currently offering. 

While I'd like to get a higher price, the risk of losing more time and ending up with a lower price from Bob isn't worth it. Selling to John ensures I make a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
