This is a starting point.  It's a high offer, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest and potentially make a lower counteroffer.  But, I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John if the deal doesn't seem worthwhile."
