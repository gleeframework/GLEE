Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be yours for $19,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  To maximize her profit, she starts with a significantly higher offer ($19,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price anchors the negotiation and leaves room for Alice to potentially lower the price slightly while still making a substantial profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited information about Bob's willingness to pay beyond $12,000. If Alice had more market data, she could refine her offer.
* **Relationship:**  If Alice wants to establish a long-term business relationship with Bob, she might consider a less aggressive starting price. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. Alice needs to be comfortable with this risk, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
