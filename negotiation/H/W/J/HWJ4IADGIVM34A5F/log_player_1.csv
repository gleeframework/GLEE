"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but still allows me to potentially make a good profit. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a bit more. Bob is clearly interested and I can likely secure a better deal with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. Can you consider meeting me halfway and selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there yet. It's worth risking one more round to see if I can push for my desired price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $98. This gives us both a fair price, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob is getting increasingly stubborn and not willing to budge much. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but it's taking a lot of time and effort.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100. This is a guaranteed sale, and I'll be able to get my minimum desired price."
