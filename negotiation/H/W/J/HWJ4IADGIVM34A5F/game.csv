"I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way, we both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. Can you consider meeting me halfway and selling it to me for $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $98. This gives us both a fair price, and we can close the deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,92.0,Bob,6,
