"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I'm looking for $9,500 for it.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible.
* **Reasonable offer:** $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's not too aggressive, but it still leaves room for Alice to come up a bit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Bob is framing the offer as a fair price based on the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has come down, $9,000 is still above Bob's desired price range. There's still potential to negotiate further and get a better deal.
* **Potential for a lower price:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get Alice to lower her price even more.
* **Avoiding John's price:**  While John's offer is a fallback option, Bob is still trying to avoid paying that much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer ($8,500) and Alice's current offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** Bob is framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's sense of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, keeping the negotiations moving forward."
