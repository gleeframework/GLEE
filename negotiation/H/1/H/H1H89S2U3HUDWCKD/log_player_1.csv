"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. This gives me some leeway to adjust if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I think Bob might be willing to meet me there considering his last offer. If he rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems we can't reach a price we both agree on.  John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
