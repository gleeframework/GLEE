"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's aim for a final agreement this round.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
