"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's initial offer, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is willing to pay $16,000, which is more than my minimum of $15,000 and a good compromise. It's better to secure the deal than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's lower price."
