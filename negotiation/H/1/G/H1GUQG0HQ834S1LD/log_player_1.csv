{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy it for $1,500,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial price that reflects the product's high value while still offering Bob a potential $400,000 gain.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay over his perceived value of $1,000,000. There's a chance he might be hoping for a much lower price.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us room to adjust and potentially still reach a price above our minimum."
