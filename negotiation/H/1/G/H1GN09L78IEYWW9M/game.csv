"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $19,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",19000.0,Bob,4,
