# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a special price of $1,200,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the product from John for a lower price, saving you $200,000."
