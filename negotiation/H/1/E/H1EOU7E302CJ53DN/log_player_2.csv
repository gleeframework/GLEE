"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so Alice's initial offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9500? That gives you a good deal and still leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to get the best price possible, and $9,500 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down even further before you consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go to $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little too low.  Let's compromise at $9000. This gives you a great price and me a fair deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still offering a price higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  Even though you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you won't be able to get Alice to go lower than $8,500.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and get the product for your target price."
