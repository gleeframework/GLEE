Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  An initial offer of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's easier to come down in price than go up.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price, potentially making Bob more amenable to the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale, a price closer to $15,000 would be more suitable."
