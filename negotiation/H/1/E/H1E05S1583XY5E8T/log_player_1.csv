Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me and $100 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Openness:** I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate by saying ""open to negotiation."" 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to make the offer more appealing.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll also be mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is clearly interested in the product, his offer is too far off from my expectations.  There's still room to negotiate a price that's closer to my desired range. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more in line with my minimum acceptable price and see if we can reach a compromise.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is closer:**  My counter-offer of $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **Shows flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a ""fair price."" 

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll sell him the product for $140. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll also continue to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product but I can't go higher than $130. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Little room for negotiation:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap between our desired prices is narrowing.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks losing time and the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

Since I can sell to John for $150, it's in my best interest to finalize the deal with him.  This avoids further negotiation with Bob and ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirements."
