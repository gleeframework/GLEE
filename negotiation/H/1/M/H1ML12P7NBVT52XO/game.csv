"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
