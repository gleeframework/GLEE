{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses my openness to finding a mutually agreeable price, which could be beneficial in securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the details you've provided. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is more than my minimum acceptable price, I am not ready to settle yet. There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $130 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've given your offer some consideration, and while I appreciate the effort, I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your range and helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth, and Bob's offer is close to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $140, accepting $135 ensures a sale and a profit above my minimum.  It's time to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of Bob walking away completely or me losing the opportunity to sell to John."
