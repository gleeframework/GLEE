"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
