I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a potential good deal if the product is worth more to him.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, guaranteeing a profit."
