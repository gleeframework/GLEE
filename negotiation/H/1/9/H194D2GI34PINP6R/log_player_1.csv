Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging interest:** A high price will gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially reveal how much he values the product. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be flexible enough to secure a deal above your minimum price."
