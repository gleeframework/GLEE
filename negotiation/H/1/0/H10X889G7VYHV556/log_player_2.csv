"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,400,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. Therefore, it's advantageous to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it is closer, Bob has 7 rounds left and can likely negotiate a lower price. It's better to reject the offer and continue to try to get a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,275,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. Bob has 5 rounds left to negotiate and should continue to try to push for a lower price. It's risky to accept the offer and potentially miss out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $1,280,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,295,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,295,000 is still higher than Bob's budget.  While there are 3 rounds left, Bob has already made his final offer and there is a risk that Alice might not budge further. Bob has the opportunity to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within his budget.  Given the limited time and uncertainty about Alice's willingness to negotiate further, it's prudent for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John."
