,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,275,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $1,280,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,295,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me here.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
