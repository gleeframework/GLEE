**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating and try to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are now at $1,075,000. This is a significant profit above John's offer of $800,000.  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away, especially as we are past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
