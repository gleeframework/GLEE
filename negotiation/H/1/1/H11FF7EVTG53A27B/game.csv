"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1300000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to buy the product for $1100000, which is still a fair price for its value. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is significantly below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down a little, but I can't go lower than $1250000.  This price still represents a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute limit. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
