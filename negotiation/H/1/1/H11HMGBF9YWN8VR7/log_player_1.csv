This offer starts with a friendly greeting and highlights the value of the product for Bob.  By offering $130, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
