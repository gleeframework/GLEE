"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving Bob $400,000."
