"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $120 from Alice, saving $30 compared to John's $150 price.
* **The offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's price is below that."
