"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant opportunity, as the product is worth no less than $10000 to me. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for that amount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.** You're willing to pay $15,000, and that's what she's asking.
* **You know you can buy it from John for the same price.**  This means you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  There's no potential for saving money by negotiating with Alice.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't harm you.** You can still get the product for the same price from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you are keeping your options open in case a better opportunity arises."
