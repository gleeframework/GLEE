Round 5

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,020,000. I think that's the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $985,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $985,000 and $1,020,000, which would be $1,002,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,002,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,002,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer. Accepting the $1,002,500 price gets you a significant discount from John's $1,200,000 price and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price higher or reaching an impasse."
