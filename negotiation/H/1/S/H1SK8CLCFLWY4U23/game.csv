"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that price point be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,020,000. I think that's the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $985,000? It would allow me to get the product while ensuring you still make a reasonable profit.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $985,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $985,000 and $1,020,000, which would be $1,002,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1002500.0,Alice,7,
