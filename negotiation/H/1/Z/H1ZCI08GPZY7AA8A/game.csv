"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value and your desired price. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can realistically afford. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price given our positions. I hope we can finalize this deal before we run out of time.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250, but I need to be closer to my target. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
