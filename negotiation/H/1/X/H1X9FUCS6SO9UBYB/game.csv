"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? I can do $140 for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $100, and see if we can reach a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go as low as $100. My final offer is $125. This is a great deal for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,5,
