Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't want to start too low. A high initial offer leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's worth.
* **Below John's offer:** The price is strategically set slightly below John's offer ($1,500,000). This creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He's getting a ""deal"" compared to what you're guaranteed elsewhere. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The message is phrased to invite counter-offers. By framing it as a ""proposal,"" Alice suggests flexibility and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
