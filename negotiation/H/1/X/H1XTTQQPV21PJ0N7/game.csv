"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product and want to make a deal happen. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $990000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $997500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",997500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised by your persistence, Bob! I've already made several concessions, but I'm willing to make one more effort to reach an agreement. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's close to my minimum. I can offer you a price of $999000. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",999000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more effort to reach an agreement, Alice. However, $999000 is still a bit high for me. I've gone as low as I can, so I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal. I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",0.0,Bob,10,
