Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still being a price we're comfortable accepting.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a strong fallback option with John."
