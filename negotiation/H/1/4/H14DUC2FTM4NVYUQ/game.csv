"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $90 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John at that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
