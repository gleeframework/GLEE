# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom of the price range I'm willing to consider.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been willing to negotiate and meet you halfway, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge further, and Bob only has one round left.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
