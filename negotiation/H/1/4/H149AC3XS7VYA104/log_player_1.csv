Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""one-time offer"" element introduces a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by testing Bob's upper limit. There's a chance Bob might accept the $1,500,000 price. If he rejects it, we can always fall back on John's offer, ensuring we still get our minimum desired price."
