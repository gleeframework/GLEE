"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $900,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though you don't know Alice's true value for the product, accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
