"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I understand you may not know its full potential, but I'm confident it's worth far more than the price I'm asking. I'm willing to let it go for $950000. This is a significant discount considering its true worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I'll be happy to sell it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
