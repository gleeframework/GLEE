"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value and allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
