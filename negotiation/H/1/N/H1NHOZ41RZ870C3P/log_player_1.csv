{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to get the ball rolling and potentially secure a quick deal. However, I am prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
