"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** $11,000 is significantly closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000 than Alice's previous offer of $11,500. 
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless:**  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at $12,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and avoids the potential of paying more to John."
