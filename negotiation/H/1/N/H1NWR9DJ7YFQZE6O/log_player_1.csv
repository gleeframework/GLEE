(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: Bob has not significantly increased his offer from his initial $9,500. It seems unlikely he will meet the desired price point. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
