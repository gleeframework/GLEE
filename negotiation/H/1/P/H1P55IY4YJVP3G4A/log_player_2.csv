# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can still do better.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller who might offer a better deal."
