I'm going to keep pushing for a better price from Bob.  While $11,000 is more than my minimum, there are still more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to keep pushing for a better price from Bob. We are close to the $15,000 mark, but there is still room to negotiate and I don't want to settle for less."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to drop the price significantly to make a big push to get Bob to agree. With only a few rounds left, I need to try and close the deal with Bob or I risk losing out to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is tempting, I'm going to try one more counteroffer. There's a chance I can push him up to a price closer to my desired value, and we're approaching the point where I'm going to have to settle with John if I don't get a good offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still below John's offer. This is my final attempt to get a better deal from Bob."
