"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for me. How about $11,500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
