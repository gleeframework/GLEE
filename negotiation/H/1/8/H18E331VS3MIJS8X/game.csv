"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd love to see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still allow me to get a decent price and give you a great deal on a valuable product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
