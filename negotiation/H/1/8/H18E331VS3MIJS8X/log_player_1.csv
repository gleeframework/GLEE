Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still provides you with a good value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your value:**  You value the product at $15,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're asking for. 

This strategy gives you room to negotiate while still ensuring a good outcome. If Bob rejects, you can either counter with a slightly lower price or move on to John, knowing you have a guaranteed buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd love to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still allow me to get a decent price and give you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,000 isn't ideal, it's still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely.  He's shown willingness to negotiate, and it's possible we might reach a better price in the future.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
