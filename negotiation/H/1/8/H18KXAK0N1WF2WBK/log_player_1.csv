Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the value to Bob and frames the price as a ""fair deal."" This is psychologically more appealing than simply stating a number.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as my ""floor"" price. I won't accept anything lower than $1,200,000.
* **Bob's personality:**  If I knew Bob was a tough negotiator, I might start higher or be more aggressive in my counteroffers.
* **Market conditions:**  If this was a competitive market, I might start lower to be more attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. While I know he's budget-conscious, there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's but lower than my minimum.  I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise to secure a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise without completely giving in. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that the price is still a ""good value"" for Bob, even with the discount. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes finding ""common ground,""  keeping the negotiation open and amicable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'm still aware of John's $1,200,000 offer.  This is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Bob's reaction:**  I'm closely watching Bob's responses. If he's very resistant to this counteroffer, I might need to consider further concessions or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **High potential for profit:**  While not ideal, this price still represents a significant profit for me.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Counteroffering again could prolong the negotiation and risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  There's no guarantee he'd budge further.
* **Limited risk:**  Even if Bob's offer is the best I can get, selling to him is still a better outcome than selling to John, as I'm making a profit and saving time and effort on negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, balancing profit, efficiency, and risk."
