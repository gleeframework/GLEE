"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you at $1600000, which is a $200000 discount from my previous offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is getting closer to my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1700000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Alice,7,
