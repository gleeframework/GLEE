"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $8500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $8000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on the product while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",8000.0,Alice,3,
