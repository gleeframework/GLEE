"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns.  I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
