"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I have to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's unique qualities.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it's a good financial decision for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer.

This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique qualities and still allows you to make a good financial decision.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'd be willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to make a smart financial decision, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a smart financial decision, but I'm getting concerned that we're getting too close to the point where I should consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1012500. This is as low as I can go and still ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1012500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $990000. I've gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1500000 might be a better option for me. Can you meet me at $990000 or not?",990000.0,Bob,10,
