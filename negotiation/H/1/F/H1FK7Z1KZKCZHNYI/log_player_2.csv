"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You want to try and negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise.  $950,000 is a price that is attractive to you while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit, potentially making her more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your acceptable range.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer allows you to continue to push for a lower price. You are within striking distance of the deal you want, but there's no need to rush into a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer. It's the maximum you're willing to pay, and it aligns with your budget. By mentioning the ""closing the deal now"" aspect, you add a sense of urgency, potentially making Alice more likely to accept."
