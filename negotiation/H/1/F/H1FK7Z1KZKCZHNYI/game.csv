"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
