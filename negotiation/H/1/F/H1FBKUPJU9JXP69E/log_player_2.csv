Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

Alice has indicated she won't go below $1,200,000.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John at that price. There's no guarantee of further negotiation with Alice, and it eliminates the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through."
