"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,125,000? I think that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
