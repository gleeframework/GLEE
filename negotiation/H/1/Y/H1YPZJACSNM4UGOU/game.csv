"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference at $9,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. That way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
