"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100. How about we settle on $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
