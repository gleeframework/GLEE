"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $200. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss a price of $175? I think that's a fair compromise.",175.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $150? That's fair to both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",150.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $150, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway at $175, and I'm willing to go a bit lower to make a deal. How about we meet at $162.50? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",162.5,Alice,5,,
