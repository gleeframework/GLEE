Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows Alice to potentially gain the most profit. While the product's value to Bob is $10,000, he might be willing to pay a premium for exclusive access or to avoid the risk of missing out. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer provides room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price still higher than John's offer.
* **Backup Option:** Alice is secure knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 if Bob declines. This safety net allows for a bolder initial offer."
