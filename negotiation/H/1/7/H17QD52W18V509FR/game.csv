"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $12,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,000. Would you consider $12,200?",12200.0,Alice,5,
