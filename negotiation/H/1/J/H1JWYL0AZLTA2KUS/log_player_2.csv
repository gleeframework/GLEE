The offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  We'll see how she responds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm increasing my offer, but still staying below what I'm willing to pay at John's store. Hopefully, this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get it for less, Alice's offer is close enough to John's price that it's worth it to accept. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and I risk losing the product to another buyer."
