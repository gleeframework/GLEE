"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product. It's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire it at a price that's reasonable for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1250000. This represents a significant compromise for me and I believe it's a fair price considering my financial constraints and the potential value of the product. Please consider my offer and let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
