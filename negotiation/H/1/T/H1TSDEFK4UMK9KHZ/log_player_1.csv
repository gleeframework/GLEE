Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. It gives Bob some room to negotiate, increasing the chances of a deal while still leaving you with a profitable outcome. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum price."
