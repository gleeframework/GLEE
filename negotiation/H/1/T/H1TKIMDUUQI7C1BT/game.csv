"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I understand the value it holds and am confident it can be a significant asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
