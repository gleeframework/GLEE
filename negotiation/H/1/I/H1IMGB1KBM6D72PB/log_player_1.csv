"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm going to start high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and allows for room to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also considering selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise, but it's still a good distance from Bob's offer. If he rejects, I'll be more seriously considering selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't moved much, and I'm getting concerned about running out of time. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to take the secure option and sell to John."
