"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. It's a fair offer, leaving room for negotiation, but still closer to my desired price than John's offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $85 just yet. I can still potentially get a better price from him, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $80 when I know the product is worth more to Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $90. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm confident that I can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round.  I'm not willing to risk selling to John for $80 when I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $89. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better price than his last offer.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one! I'm getting close to my minimum price of $80, and we're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for less.  I'll accept Bob's offer of $88 and secure the sale."
