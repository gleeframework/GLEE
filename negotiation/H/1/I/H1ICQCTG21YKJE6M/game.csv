"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
