"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? This is my best counteroffer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000 instead.",800000.0,Bob,8,
