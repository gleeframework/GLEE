"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you'd get if you sold it to John."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten a significant discount from the initial price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  He could also end up paying John the full $800,000."
