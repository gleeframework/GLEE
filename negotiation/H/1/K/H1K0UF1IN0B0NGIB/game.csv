"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you'd get if you sold it to John.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it.",725000.0,Alice,3,
