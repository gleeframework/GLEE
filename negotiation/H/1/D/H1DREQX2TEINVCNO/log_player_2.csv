Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer it to you for $95, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown she is unwilling to meet your price target of $80. It's unlikely she'll move much further, and you risk losing the guaranteed deal with John if you continue haggling with Alice."
