"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening that gives me room to negotiate if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Bob sees value in the deal and I can secure a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer will ensure a sale at a price that's still very favorable."
