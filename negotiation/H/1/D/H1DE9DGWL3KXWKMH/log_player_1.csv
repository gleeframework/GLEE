Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $800,000, so $900,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $1,000,000, so you're not giving away the farm. 
* **It's a clear starting point:**  This price gives Bob a concrete number to work with and prevents the negotiation from getting bogged down in vague terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm going to try and push Bob a bit higher with a counteroffer.  There's a chance he'll come up a little, and even if not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $750,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. However, I'm not walking away entirely. I'm showing flexibility by making a counteroffer that's closer to his price, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This counteroffer is a calculated risk: it might encourage Bob to come up a bit, or it might make him walk away.  If he walks away, I can always sell to John.
* **Price Justification:**  I'm offering $850,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000.  This signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is polite and focuses on finding common ground, rather than being confrontational. This can help maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000. How about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, hoping to push him to $800,000. If he rejects that, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and drop my price to $800,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, so I hope you can see the value in accepting this offer. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, but not by much. I'm making one final counteroffer to see if I can meet his needs while still getting a price closer to my desired value.  If he rejects, I'll move on to John.
* **Price Justification:**  $800,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $775,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finality:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains polite, but emphasizes the value Bob would get by accepting the offer."
