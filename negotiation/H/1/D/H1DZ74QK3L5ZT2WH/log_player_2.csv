This is a great deal for Bob, but there is still room to negotiate. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While Alice's offer is still a good deal, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room to compromise."

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and this offer is still significantly lower than the price from John.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a few more thousand dollars in savings."
