"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a significant discount for Bob, while still leaving me a healthy profit. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,375,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still leaving me with a profit. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to close the deal at this price.  If he rejects, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already used 5 rounds, and there's a risk of not getting a better offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum profit, and with the time constraints, it's the most sensible choice."
