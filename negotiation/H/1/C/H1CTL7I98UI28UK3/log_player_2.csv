"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $12,000 is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for seeing if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than John's price.  Bob should reject and continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still trying to save some money.  $14,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is only $1,500 lower than John's price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as Bob could potentially lose the opportunity to buy from John at a lower price.  It's better to be safe and secure the product from John for $15,000."
