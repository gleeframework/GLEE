"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but  $650,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $575,000?",575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $575,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you consider $525,000?",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $550,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $540,000?",540000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $540,000 is tempting, but I'm trying to stay closer to the $500,000 mark. How about a final offer of $530,000? ",530000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $535,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize getting a good deal for the product. How about we meet at $535,000?",535000.0,Alice,7,
