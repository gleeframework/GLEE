"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $125.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down a little more, to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
