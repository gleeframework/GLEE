Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also aware that John will buy for $15,000, so I'm not risking a complete loss by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's also a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum value.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, so that's the best option for me at this point."
