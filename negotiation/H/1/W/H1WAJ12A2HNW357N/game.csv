"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me.  I'm more comfortable in the range of $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand where you're coming from, however,  $800,000 is quite a bit below the market value for this product.  Could you do $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand the product's value, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $1,050,000. How about $1,225,000? This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. I can do $1,100,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I do have another opportunity lined up. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
