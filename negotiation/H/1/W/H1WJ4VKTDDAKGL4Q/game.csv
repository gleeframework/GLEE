"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10500?  It's a fair price considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10000.  Let's compromise at $10250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
