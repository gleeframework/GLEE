Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is really pushing it. How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,750? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still above John's price. It's unlikely she'll go below $7,750.  It makes more financial sense to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
