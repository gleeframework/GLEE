"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to stick with my original counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,280,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you a revised price of $1,280,000. I hope we can find a way to close the deal at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
