While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still slightly above it. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. You might be able to get a better price with a new counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,280,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you a revised price of $1,280,000. I hope we can find a way to close the deal at this price.

You've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice might be futile. While you're close to your target price, you're not quite there yet, and Alice is showing resistance to going lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000, as it's guaranteed and within your budget."
