"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a relatively high price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm erring on the side of maximizing potential profit.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of Bob engaging in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""amazingness"" of the product to subtly imply its worth.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a starting point that's above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum of $100, so I'm not desperate to accept it. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I can try to push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Time to counter:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price.

This strategy keeps the negotiation alive, maximizing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 would be the lowest I could go. This product really is special and I think it's worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (partially):**  My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value (again):** I'm reinforcing the ""special"" nature of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Direct question:**  The question ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation open and demonstrating my commitment to making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is special, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $130 is very close to my desired price, and only $5 below my last counteroffer.
* **Limited rounds:** We're already in round 4, meaning I have fewer rounds to negotiate. 
* **Risk of John:**  If I keep rejecting, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $100, which is significantly lower.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's still good for me and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
