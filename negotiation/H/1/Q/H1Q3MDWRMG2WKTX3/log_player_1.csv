Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer of $1,900,000  leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and I'm willing to come down slightly while still staying significantly above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in the price, making it more persuasive. 
* **John as Leverage:** While I don't explicitly mention John, knowing I have another buyer gives me a strong position. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything."
