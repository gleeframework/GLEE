"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm happy to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can offer it to you for $105, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a compromise from my original price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair price considering we've both made some concessions. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer it to you for $100. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
