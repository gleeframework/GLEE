# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is substantial and goes beyond $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price point represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $1,300,000 is still above your budget. You should continue to negotiate by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  You can push for a lower price, especially since you are close to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to reach an agreement, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my final offer. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still above your budget, and she's stating it's her ""final offer"".  This suggests she might be unwilling to negotiate further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the sure thing with John and buy the product for $800,000.  You've already made several counteroffers and pushed for a lower price, but continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely or getting stuck with a price higher than your maximum."
