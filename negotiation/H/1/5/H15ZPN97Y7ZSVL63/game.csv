"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth every penny!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $110 is steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. It's a fair price for a great product like this.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about $105 is too high, but $100 is too low. Let's meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
