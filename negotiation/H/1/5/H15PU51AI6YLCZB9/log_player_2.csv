Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
