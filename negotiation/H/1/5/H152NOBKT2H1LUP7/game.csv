"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",725000.0,Alice,5,
