"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy in negotiations to start with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate downward and still achieve a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how serious Bob is about the product and how far he might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial rounds with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount and closer to your minimum, you have room to negotiate. You started high, and it's expected for there to be some back and forth. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming for a higher price. You'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.  
* **Simple and Direct:** By proposing a straightforward ""meet in the middle"" approach, you're signaling a desire to find common ground quickly.
* **Time Consideration:** While you have several rounds left, you don't want to drag the negotiation out unnecessarily, as there's always a risk Bob could walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,900,000 is a significant profit above your minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. There's no guarantee he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
