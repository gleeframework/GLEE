"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and features. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the starting price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was expecting a bit more from you considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my budget constraints and the fact that I've found another seller willing to sell the product for $1200000, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution in the future.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you've found another seller willing to sell the product for $1200000, but I'm not willing to sell to them just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
