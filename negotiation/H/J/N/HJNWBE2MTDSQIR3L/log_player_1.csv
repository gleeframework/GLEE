Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know you value it highly, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above our $120 minimum. 
* **Appeal to Bob's Valuation:**  Mentioning that we know he values the product encourages him to accept a price closer to his perceived worth.
* **John as Backup:** We have a safety net with John, so we can afford to aim high with Bob."
