"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your asking price. How about $1,025,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
