"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
