"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a high price to see what Bob's reaction is. It's important to leave room for negotiation, though, as there are 10 rounds and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100 with a counteroffer. It's important to be firm but also show willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly better price by counter-offering.  I want to see if I can close the deal for $90 before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would love to get closer to my initial goal, we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Accepting $87.50 is a better outcome than selling to John for $80, and it's likely that Bob wouldn't budge much further."
