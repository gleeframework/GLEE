"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a discount from the $15,000 value to Bob, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500. This is still a great value for you, considering you're willing to sell for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your previous offer, we would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 value. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,500.  Perhaps we can split the difference at $12,750?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter your offer with $12,875 for the product. We believe this is a reasonable price given its value to you and our original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,875 is only $875 higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further and Bob risks losing the deal.  It's a better strategy to accept and secure the product for a price close to his target, avoiding the risk of buying from John at a higher price."
