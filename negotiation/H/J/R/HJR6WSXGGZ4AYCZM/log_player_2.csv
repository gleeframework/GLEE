```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $1000000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what John is selling the product for.  Since you're not able to negotiate further with Alice, it makes more sense to purchase from John and avoid any further potential delays or negotiations."
