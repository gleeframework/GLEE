"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $1000000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to cover my costs.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
