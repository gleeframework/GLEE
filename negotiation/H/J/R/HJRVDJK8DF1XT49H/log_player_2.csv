Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,900. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's getting closer to John's price.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield a significantly better result."
