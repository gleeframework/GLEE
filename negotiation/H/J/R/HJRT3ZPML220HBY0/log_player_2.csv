"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

You know the product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, and Alice has offered the maximum price you're willing to pay.  However, there's no reason to jump at this price immediately.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary. It also signals to Alice that I am serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial price, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  I still have 7 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by dropping her price to $9,000. I'm going to meet her halfway with a counteroffer of $8,000. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
