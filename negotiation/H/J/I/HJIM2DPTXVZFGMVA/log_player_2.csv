"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1200000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Consider this carefully, as I'm confident you won't find this opportunity elsewhere. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no benefit to buying from her since you can get the same product from John for the same price.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, but there's no information to suggest that's possible."
