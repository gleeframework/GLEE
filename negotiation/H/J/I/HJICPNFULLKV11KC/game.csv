"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to move forward with the sale.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
