"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer,  $1,200,000,  that's still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value Bob will receive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This allows for a potential negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. There's still room to negotiate and try to get closer to my goal.
* **Negotiation Power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to hold out for a better price. It also signals to Bob that he needs to make a more competitive offer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe option, but it wouldn't maximize my profit potential.  Continuing the negotiation gives me a chance to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  It's still above my minimum desired price of $800,000, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the reasoning behind my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your offer. Based on my research and budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $800,000.  It's a significant profit and a good outcome. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, meaning there's limited time to reach an agreement.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from running out of rounds."
