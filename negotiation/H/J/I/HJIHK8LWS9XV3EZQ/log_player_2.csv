"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my ideal price.
* There's potential to negotiate further and save more money. 
* By rejecting the offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price.
* Accepting the offer would result in a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ending up paying more than $1,050,000 is too high."
