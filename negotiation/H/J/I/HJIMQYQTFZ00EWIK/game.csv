"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $115. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Can you do that for me?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $100, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, but $105 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
