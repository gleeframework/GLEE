"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's potential value of $12,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is a good profit. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
