"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and likely to be rejected. However, it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a lower price point for subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only slightly adjusting her price. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I have 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  It's also a fair midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Alice and move us closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price.  I'm going to continue negotiating, as I have several rounds left and the possibility of getting a better deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always purchase from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to $11,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway. However, it still remains below her latest offer, so I'm hoping she'll be more open to accepting this compromise. With 5 rounds remaining, I have time to explore this further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still higher than my target price. However, we are now at the halfway point of the negotiation, and I have three rounds remaining to reach a deal. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer before I potentially have to resort to buying from John.  $12,000 is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to her desired price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept the deal. If it's rejected, I'll likely have to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below John's price.  With only one round remaining, the chances of Alice accepting a lower counteroffer are slim. It's more efficient to buy from John now and avoid further negotiation."
