Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $120, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum value I have for the product. I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better price.

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 100}

Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's the counteroffer I sent to Bob:

{""product_price"": 100}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
