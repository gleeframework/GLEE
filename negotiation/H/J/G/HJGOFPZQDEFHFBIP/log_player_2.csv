"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm confident it will be of great value to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $150, which is more than Alice's offer, but I'd rather not pay that much. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to negotiate.
