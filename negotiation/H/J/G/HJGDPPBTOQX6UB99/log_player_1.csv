Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the benefit for both of us, which may make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but still indicating my strong desire to make a deal with him. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and a clear point at which I will walk away from the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:** While $850,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's still below my floor of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, giving me leverage to push for a better price. 
* **Counteroffering potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows for both of us to make a good profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining my value:** I'm not going too low, as $900,000 is still within my acceptable range and higher than Bob's offer.
* **Open-ended invitation:** I'm inviting Bob to find common ground and express a belief that this price is mutually beneficial. 
* **Plan B still active:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I haven't forgotten about John's offer, which gives me leverage to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize the transaction at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000), but it's still below it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a lower price, and I'm not willing to risk going below my floor.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Time and effort:**  The negotiation has already taken some time and effort, and I don't want to risk spending more time for a potentially lower price.

**By selling to John, I'm ensuring I achieve my minimum acceptable value for the product and avoid any further risk of a lower offer.**"
