"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet halfway!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us and lets us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000, which is a fair compromise and still within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,7,
