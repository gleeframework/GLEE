Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation, but also ensures I'm maximizing my potential profit.  If Bob rejects, we can move into a counteroffer strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and while it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for some profit. It's also a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer,  showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe this price could be enticing enough for Bob to accept, while also ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 than my previous counteroffer. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement and represents a good compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids risking a longer negotiation with the possibility of Bob backing out or continuing to lowball me. Selling to John would guarantee $1,200,000, but accepting Bob's offer still yields a substantial profit and avoids the hassle of dealing with John."
