Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it'll be a valuable asset for you too. I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
