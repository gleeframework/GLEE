"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. Would you consider $1,050,000? This price still reflects the value this product can bring to your business, and it gives us both room to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
