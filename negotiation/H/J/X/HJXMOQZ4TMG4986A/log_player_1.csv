{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be highly valuable for your business.  My asking price is $1,150,000, reflecting its unique capabilities and the value it can bring.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. Would you consider $1,050,000? This price still reflects the value this product can bring to your business, and it gives us both room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
