"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a win-win for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $120?  That way we both get what we want, and we can close the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $120, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $110? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,6,
