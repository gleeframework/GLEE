"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $150 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there yet. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $140 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $130. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",130.0,Bob,6,
