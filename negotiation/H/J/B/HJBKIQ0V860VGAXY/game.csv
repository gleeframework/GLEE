"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
