"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $12,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 as a final concession. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
