"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its true market value. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us, but I'm also open to selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a significant savings for you, and it's the best I can do at this time.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
