"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $15,000, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work towards a more mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Even though I'm starting to feel the pressure of needing to close a deal, $10,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have 8 rounds left. It's worth trying to push for a higher price with a counteroffer, especially since Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better outcome:** There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

I'll try to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not desperate.
* **Positive but firm tone:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the value of the product and my commitment to a fair price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm aiming for a gradual increase in price with each round, hoping to get Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Still leaving room:**  There's room to negotiate further if needed, but I'm also ready to walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'd like to counter with $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to see if I can get a higher price.  I have more rounds and I think Bob is serious about buying. 
* **Increasing pressure:** The clock is ticking, and I'm under pressure to sell. But I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired amount and see if I can bridge the gap. 

I'll counter with $11,250 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This reflects the value of the product and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount this time, signaling that I'm getting close to my desired price but not giving in easily.
* **Emphasizing common ground:** The message mentions ""meeting you halfway"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and create a feeling of progress.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm still leaving some room for negotiation but making it clear that I'm not going to budge much further. 
* **Time is running out:**  We are halfway through the rounds, so it's important to start closing the deal."
