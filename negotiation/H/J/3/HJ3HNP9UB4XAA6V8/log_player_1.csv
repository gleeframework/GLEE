{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a friendly tone can help Bob feel more receptive to the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $90 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $120, there's a chance I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I think you'd be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $90, but my offer is still a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to $100 or even slightly higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, the potential to get a slightly better deal with Bob is worth the risk of a few more negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $95, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($95). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that $97.50 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good rapport with Bob and avoid any potential for him to walk away."
