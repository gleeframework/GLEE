"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John. There's no benefit to accepting her offer. It's better to reject and keep the option open for possible negotiation later or move directly to John."
