"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the details.  If you decline, I have a separate offer on the table for $1,200,000, which I will accept.  ",1400000.0,Alice,1,
