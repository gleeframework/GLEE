Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it presents a significant opportunity for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  $1,000,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it still allows him a potential profit margin if he leverages the product effectively. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000."
