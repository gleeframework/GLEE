"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in my product, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,250,000?  This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's more in line with the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
