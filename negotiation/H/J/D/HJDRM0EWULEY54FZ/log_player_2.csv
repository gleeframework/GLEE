"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its worth while ensuring it's within your budget considerations. Would you be open to discussing this further? Please let me know if there's a specific range you're considering, so we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's message is full of marketing fluff, but the key takeaway is her offer of $140. While this is below your absolute maximum, you know you have a backup option with John for $150.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice with a counter-offer."
