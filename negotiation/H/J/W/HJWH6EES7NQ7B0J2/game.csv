"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $850,000 undervalues the true potential and uniqueness of this product. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  To move towards a win-win, I'm proposing $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, and I value this product. However, $920,000 is still a bit high for me. To show my commitment, I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's try to bridge the gap.",880000.0,Bob,4,
