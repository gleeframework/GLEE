"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
