Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I believe the product is indeed valuable, but I still feel that $10,000 is a fair price for it. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $12,000 from John ensures a sure profit and avoids the risk of Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
