"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of your product, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11750 is closer, but I'm still only comfortable at $11000.  This is a fair price, given the value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not quite comfortable with $11000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $11500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
