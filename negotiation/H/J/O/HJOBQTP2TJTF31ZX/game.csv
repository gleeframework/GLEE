"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your interest in selling this product. However,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is the best I can do at the moment.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",925000.0,Alice,5,
