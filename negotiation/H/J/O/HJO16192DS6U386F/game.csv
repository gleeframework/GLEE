"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
