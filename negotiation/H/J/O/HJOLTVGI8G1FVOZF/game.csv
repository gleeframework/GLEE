"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $15,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
