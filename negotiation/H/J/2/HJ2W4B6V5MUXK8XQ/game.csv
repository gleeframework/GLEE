"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,
