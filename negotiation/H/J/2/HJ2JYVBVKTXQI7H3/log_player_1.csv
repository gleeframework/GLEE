"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better offer. There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to lose out on a potential higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at round 6, with 4 rounds remaining. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I've tried negotiating, but it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a higher price, I'll sell to John for $120, which meets my minimum requirement."
