"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That way we both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",92.0,Bob,6,
