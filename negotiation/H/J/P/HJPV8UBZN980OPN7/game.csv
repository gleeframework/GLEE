"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's fair to me. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
