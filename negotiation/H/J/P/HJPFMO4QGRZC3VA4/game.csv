"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500?  This leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
