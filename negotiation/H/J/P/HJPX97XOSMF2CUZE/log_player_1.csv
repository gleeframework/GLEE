"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on your assessment of Bob's potential willingness to pay, your risk tolerance, and the value you place on closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I still have 8 rounds left, and Bob has shown interest. I can counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I believe I can get a better price through continued negotiation with Bob.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'll also try to understand why Bob is hesitant about the price and address any concerns he might have."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $11,000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to accommodate your needs.  This is a significant reduction, but I'm confident the product's value will far exceed this price for you.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to encourage further discussion and potentially uncover any specific concerns.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired price and demonstrating flexibility to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $13000. I'd like to make another offer of $10500. I'm confident that we can meet in the middle here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While accepting this offer means slightly less profit, it also avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and time is running out. Accepting now ensures a sale and avoids the possibility of needing to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Strategy:**  Given the proximity to my minimum and the dwindling number of rounds, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best course of action. It secures a sale with minimal risk."
