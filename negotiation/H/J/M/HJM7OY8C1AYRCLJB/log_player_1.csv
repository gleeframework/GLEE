Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible, and I know Bob values the product at $80.  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or increases the chance of a quick sale at a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80. This means I don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter with a lower price, giving me a better understanding of his willingness to pay."
