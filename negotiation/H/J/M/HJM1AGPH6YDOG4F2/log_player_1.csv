Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might decline. Offering it slightly lower at $140 increases the likelihood of a sale and still nets you a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays in finding another buyer. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By phrasing it as a ""pre-listing"" offer, you create a sense of exclusivity and encourage Bob to act quickly."
