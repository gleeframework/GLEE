"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $135?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my target.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
