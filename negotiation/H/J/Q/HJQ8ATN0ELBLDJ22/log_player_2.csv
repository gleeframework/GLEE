{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $87 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $87 is within your budget of $100.**
* **This is a good deal for you as it's lower than your initial counteroffer of $85.** 
* **It's also likely that Alice won't go lower, as her minimum value is $80.**"
