"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am currently working within a budget of $1500000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1500000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1250000? This would still allow you to stay within your budget while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the flexibility shown in your last offer. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1250000. Would you be open to discussing other terms or conditions that might allow us to reach an agreement closer to my budget of $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
