**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own value, it's still higher than the price John is offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to accept your offer just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,090,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above what John is offering.  Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's best to buy the product from John at $1,000,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept your next counteroffer and it's not worth risking losing a good deal."
