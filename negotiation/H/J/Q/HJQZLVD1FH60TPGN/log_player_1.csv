Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While the jump to $1,200,000 is significant, phrasing it as reflecting ""true worth"" avoids directly stating it's worth more to Bob than our minimum.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains  open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style. If we knew he was extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower starting point might be wiser. 
* **Time sensitivity:** If we were under time pressure to sell, we might reduce the price to ensure a quicker deal with Bob. However, the guaranteed offer from John gives us leverage."
