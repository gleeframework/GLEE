"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
