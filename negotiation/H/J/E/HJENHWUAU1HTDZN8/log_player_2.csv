Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not that high. I can offer you $13,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $13,500.  At this point, cutting my losses and securing the product from John at $12,000 is the most financially sound decision."
