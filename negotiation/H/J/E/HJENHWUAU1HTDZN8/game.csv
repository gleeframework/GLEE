"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not that high. I can offer you $13,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
