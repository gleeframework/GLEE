"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still give you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
