"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Bob should reject the offer.  While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. He still has 9 rounds to try and get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still committed to $850,000 as my maximum.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistent effort, Bob. I value the opportunity to work with you. Considering the value you see in the product and our previous offers, I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her original asking price. While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal for both parties and secures the product."
