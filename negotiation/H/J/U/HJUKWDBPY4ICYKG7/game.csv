"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product. ",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $7,000 for the product. I think that's a fair offer considering the market value of similar items.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Let's settle this right now.  If you agree to $15,000 we can close the deal today.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I. I can go up to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're interested.",7500.0,Bob,6,
