"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product. "",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While $5,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and your $8,000 limit, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  This initial counteroffer allows space to gradually increase the bid over subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Gauge Alice's Seriousness:**  Alice's response to this counteroffer will indicate how flexible she's willing to be and whether a deal within your budget is realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice lowered her price, $18,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and a long way from your initial counteroffer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure you. It's important to show you're not easily swayed.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still several rounds left, and it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $7,000 for the product. I think that's a fair offer considering the market value of similar items."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer jumps to $7,000, demonstrating willingness to move closer to your limit but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you introduce an external factor to support your offer, even if it's a slight bluff.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if Alice is genuinely willing to negotiate within a reasonable range or if she's fixed on a much higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Let's settle this right now.  If you agree to $15,000 we can close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $15,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit. 
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice's message is another attempt to pressure you into a quick decision (""settle this right now""). Don't let this sway you. 
* **Midpoint Reached:** We've essentially reached a midpoint between your initial offers. This is a good sign that a compromise might be possible, but you need to show you're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I. I can go up to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but also establishes a clear and firm limit. 
* **Small Increase:** The $500 increase signals flexibility without significantly impacting your budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Letting Alice know this is your absolute limit and that you're ready to close adds a sense of urgency and encourages a final decision."
