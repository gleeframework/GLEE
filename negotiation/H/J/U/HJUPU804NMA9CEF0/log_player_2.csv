Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $825,000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
