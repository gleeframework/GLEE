"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,050,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know if this price is acceptable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",1020000.0,Bob,4,
