"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's uniqueness, I'm willing to pay $500000. This price is more in line with my financial limitations, but it's still a substantial investment. I believe this offer is fair, and I'm eager to continue the negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the product's unique value while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
