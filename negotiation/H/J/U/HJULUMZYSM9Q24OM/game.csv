"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal. ",16000.0,Alice,3,
