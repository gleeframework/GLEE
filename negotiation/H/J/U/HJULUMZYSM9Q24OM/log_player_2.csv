"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far too high. Bob should reject and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob.  He's already stated his maximum budget is $8,000, and it's clear Alice isn't going to budge much lower.  Rather than continue a drawn-out negotiation, Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price point."
