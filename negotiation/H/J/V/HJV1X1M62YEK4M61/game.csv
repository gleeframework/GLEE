"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is the best price I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,
