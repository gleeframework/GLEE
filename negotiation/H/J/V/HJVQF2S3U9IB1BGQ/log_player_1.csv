Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,400,000 is still too low."

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through a few rounds and I'm not sure how much further he's willing to go. It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
