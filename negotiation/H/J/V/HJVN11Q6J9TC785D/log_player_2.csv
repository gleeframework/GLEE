"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), and it's also close to your maximum budget ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice is likely to accept a lower price to get a sale.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John's offer is guaranteed, it's your least desirable option as it costs the most. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start negotiating and potentially secure the product for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $9,500, given the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  This shows you're serious about buying but are also willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** The price leaves room for both of us to make concessions in subsequent rounds. 
* **Staying Below Your Limit:** $9,500 is still well below your budget, leaving you some wiggle room in case Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what the product is worth to her ($8,000) and significantly closer to my maximum budget ($15,000). 
* **Further negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Avoiding John:**  I want to explore further negotiations with Alice before resorting to John's offer. 

By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $9,500."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our interests. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by going up from my previous offer of $9,500. It's still well below Alice's current offer and leaves room for a middle ground.
* **Focused on Value:**  I highlight the fairness of the price by emphasizing it considers both our perspectives.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  A positive and encouraging tone can help push Alice towards a deal. 

This counteroffer aims to find a sweet spot where Alice can still make a profit while I get a good deal and stay within my budget."
