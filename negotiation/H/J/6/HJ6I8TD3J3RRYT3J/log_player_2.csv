"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm offering you my product for a price that I'm confident is fair and beneficial to both of us.  Please consider my offer carefully, as it represents a significant potential gain for you.  I'm sure you'll find it very worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
