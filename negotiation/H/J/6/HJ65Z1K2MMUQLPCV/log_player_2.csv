"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While it's more than Alice values the product for, accepting Alice's offer at $14,500 is still cheaper than buying it from John for $15,000."
