"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair margin for you. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000. However, that's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $10000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
