"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product, but I have to be honest with you, I've already had another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to purchase it for a price that's still a great value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for a price that fits within your budget."
