"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced at the original asking price. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $10 to sweeten the deal. I'll pay a total of $135. Can you consider this offer?",135.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway multiple times, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $131.50. That's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",131.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're frustrated, Alice, and I appreciate the effort you've put into negotiating with me. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one final offer: $129 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. I hope we can come to an agreement.",129.0,Bob,10,
