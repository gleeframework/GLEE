Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1400000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1600000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'd rather explore other options. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1550000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll be forced to consider other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still slightly above my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing this opportunity is too high. It's best to stick with my original plan and buy the product from John for $1,500,000."
