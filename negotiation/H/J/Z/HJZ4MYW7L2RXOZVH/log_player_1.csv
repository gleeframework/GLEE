Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given the value you've indicated, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a good return on investment for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product, and $900,000 is a fantastic price.  It exceeds my minimum and provides a significant profit. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a better price with Bob in further rounds."
