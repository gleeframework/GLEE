Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob could yield higher profits.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also emphasizes the product's high value. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

By setting the initial offer high, but not unreasonably so, Alice increases her chances of securing the best possible deal."
