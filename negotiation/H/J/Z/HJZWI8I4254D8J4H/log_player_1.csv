Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 value, giving him some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000. This ensures that you make a profit and provides room for negotiation. 

By starting with a strong offer, you create a good starting point for negotiation and show Bob you're serious about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell and can get a higher price from John. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep the cost at or below $12,000. Could we perhaps negotiate down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that, it seems like further negotiation with Bob won't yield a better price. I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price of $15,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed higher offer from John."
