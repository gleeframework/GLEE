"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
