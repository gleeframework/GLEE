Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is more than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $12,000 is a good price, and we're getting closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle with John for $10,000."
