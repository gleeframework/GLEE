Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation or even an immediate acceptance if Bob sees additional value I'm unaware of.
* **Backup Plan:** I know John will buy the product for $8,000, which acts as my safety net. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob. 
* **Potential for More:** While I have a backup offer, there's always the chance Bob values the product even more than $10,000.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I may need to adjust my approach and potentially negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
