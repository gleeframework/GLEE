Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  

**Here's my reasoning:**

* **Potential for a higher price:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than my minimum price. 
* **Negotiation room:** By starting high, I have space to lower the price if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
