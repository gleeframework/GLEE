"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great deal for a product worth $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle again at $85.  This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Reason:While Alice's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, ensuring you stay within your spending limit."
