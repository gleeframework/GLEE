"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This price allows you a substantial return on your investment while ensuring a fair deal for me. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another potential buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and competition, but her bluff is weak.  Here's why:

* **Her alternative buyer is offering less than her valuation:** It makes no logical sense for Alice to sell to another buyer for $800,000 if she values the product at $800,000. 
* **You have a backup option:** You know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her hand. She'll likely come back with a lower price, closer to her true valuation."
