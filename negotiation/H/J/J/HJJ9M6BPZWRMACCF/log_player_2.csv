"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer of $15000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for that exact price, it's the best option to accept her offer. There's no benefit to rejecting it and buying from John for the same price."
