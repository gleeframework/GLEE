Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $100 is more than $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you don't sell below your minimum value of $120. 
* **It's a reasonable price:** $100 is a fair starting point for negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for $60. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  This would still leave some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
