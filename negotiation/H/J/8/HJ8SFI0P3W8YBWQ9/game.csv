"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I really like the product, but I still feel that $140 might be a bit out of my range. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I think $137.5 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I would like to propose $135 instead. This way, we can both feel satisfied with the transaction.",135.0,Bob,6,
