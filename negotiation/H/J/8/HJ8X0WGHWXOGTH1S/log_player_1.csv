"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and sets a high initial expectation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, indicating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also below the product's worth to Bob ($100).  Accepting this offer would be a major loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates his willingness to negotiate. This opens the opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can still sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also making a counter-proposal, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $125 is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $175, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $80 is a significant drop, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we possibly settle on $95? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below the value the product holds for me. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and his offer is closer than before. This suggests that we might be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds.
* **John remains an option:** Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail. However, I'm not willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal, indicating my flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise from my previous offer of $125, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price and encourage him to see it as a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation productive. 
* **Closing Statement:** I'm ending with a statement that encourages Bob to consider the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100, which is my absolute limit. This would be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below the value the product holds for me. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **John remains an option:** Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Few rounds left:**  With only four rounds left, I don't want to rush into a deal that's unfavorable to me. I'm hoping to push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Potential for compromise:** Bob's ""absolute limit"" statement suggests he's serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would be a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing to split the difference between Bob's offer of $100 and my previous offer of $110. This shows a genuine attempt to find a middle ground.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive Tone and Closing Statement:**  I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone, ending with a strong call to action to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only three rounds remaining, I need to be assertive while still being reasonable to close the deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm still open to selling to John for $150, I believe this offer is a good compromise that's more beneficial to me than selling to John."
