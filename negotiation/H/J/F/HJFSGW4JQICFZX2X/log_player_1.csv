**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but at a slow rate. We're getting into the later rounds, and it's unlikely he'll reach our $1,200,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John now rather than risk Bob not reaching our acceptable price."
