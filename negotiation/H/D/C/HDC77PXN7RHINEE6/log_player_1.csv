Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit further.
* **Backup Plan:** The offer implicitly acknowledges you have other options (John) without directly threatening Bob. This reinforces the product's value."
