"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000.  This gives you a significant discount and allows me to secure a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $875,000 is just a little too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm prepared to come down to $890,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",890000.0,Alice,5,
