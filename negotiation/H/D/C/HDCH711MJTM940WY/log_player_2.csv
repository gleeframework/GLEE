# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $90. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to save some money. Alice's offer of $90 is a good price, and it's lower than what I'd have to pay from John. I'll accept Alice's offer.
