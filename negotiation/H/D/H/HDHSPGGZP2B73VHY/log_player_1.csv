Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer itself:

**Negotiation Strategy**

* **High Anchor:** Start with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a great outcome.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth more to Bob ($1,200,000) than your minimum. Use this to your advantage.
* **John as Leverage (Subtly):** While you don't want to explicitly threaten Bob, the fact that you have another buyer provides a time pressure element.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential and your specific needs, I believe it's worth significantly more to you than what I'm willing to let it go for. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to a conversation, but I also have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Creates a sense of value and scarcity.
* **""Worth significantly more to you"":**  Subtly reinforces Bob's higher perceived value.
* **High Anchor ($1,150,000):** This is 75% of the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, leaving room for negotiation while aiming for a strong profit.
* **Open to Conversation:** Signals willingness to negotiate but not desperation.
* **""Other interested parties"":**  Subtle time pressure without being aggressive.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Confident:** Your tone should convey the value of your product.
* **Be Flexible:** Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but don't settle for anything below your $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Listen to Bob:** Pay attention to his responses to gauge his interest and potential counter-offers."
