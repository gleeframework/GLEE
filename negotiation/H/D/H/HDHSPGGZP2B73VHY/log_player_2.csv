"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential and your specific needs, I believe it's worth significantly more to you than what I'm willing to let it go for. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to a conversation, but I also have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to gauge how much you're willing to pay by mentioning ""other interested parties.""  While her offer is below your absolute maximum, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her closer to her $1,000,000 valuation. 

Even if Alice doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,200,000."
