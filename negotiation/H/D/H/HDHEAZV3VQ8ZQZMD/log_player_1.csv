Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $170, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. While Bob may counter significantly lower, his offer will likely be influenced by the initial high number.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level and potential price sensitivity. 
 
**Important Note:** Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $120, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a substantial gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of selling to John for $120, so there's no need to settle for a price that represents a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $170 might have been a bit high, $100 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $130 is still a profitable price for you (above your $120 minimum) while moving closer to Bob's price range.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By offering a price that's more reasonable but still favorable to you, you encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, how about we meet at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 matches your minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Guarantee of More:** While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you risk losing him as a buyer.
* **John's Offer is Equal:** Accepting Bob's offer gives you the same profit as selling to John. 
 
In this scenario, it makes the most sense to accept Bob's offer. You've successfully negotiated a price that meets your needs."
