"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500**. This is lower than the $10,000 you'd pay John.
* **Your goal is to save money**. Accepting Alice's offer means saving $500 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
