"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
