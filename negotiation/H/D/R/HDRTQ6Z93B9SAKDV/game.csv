"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has tremendous potential and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $1,900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,950,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
