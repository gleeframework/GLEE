"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John. Alice's offer is better than John's, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from her offer, but still leaves some room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to your target price. Since you can still get the product from John for $12,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your ideal price.  Offering $9,000 is a compromise that shows you're serious about buying but still trying to get a good deal. It's likely Alice will accept this offer since it's still more than her desired selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, but it's still above your preferred price.  Continuing to negotiate risks going back and forth for a long time without reaching an agreement. It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John for $12,000, which is still within your budget."
