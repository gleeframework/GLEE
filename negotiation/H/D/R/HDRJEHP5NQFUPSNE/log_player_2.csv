# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $115 for it. This offer reflects the value you see in the product while also allowing us to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product and her starting price is still a bit high. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice in a subsequent round or you can buy it from John for $120."
