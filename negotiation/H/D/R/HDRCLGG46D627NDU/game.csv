"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is exceptional and provides a lot of value, which I'm sure you'll agree with once you experience it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
