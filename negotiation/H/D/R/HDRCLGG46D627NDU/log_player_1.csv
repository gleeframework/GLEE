Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is exceptional and provides a lot of value, which I'm sure you'll agree with once you experience it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $14,000. Accepting his offer would net $14,000, while John offers a guaranteed $15,000. It's in Alice's best interest to secure the guaranteed higher amount at this point."
