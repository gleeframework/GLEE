Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested. I'm being friendly and optimistic, hoping to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is tempting, I'm really hoping to get closer to $90 for this product.  What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$82 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it seems like Bob is genuinely interested. It's likely that we won't get a better offer from Bob, so accepting his offer is the best course of action."
