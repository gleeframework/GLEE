"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to do business with you, I can't go as low as $1,200,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still aiming to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $1,250,000? This would allow us to move forward while respecting both our financial positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
