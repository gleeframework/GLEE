Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth significantly exceeds your initial valuation. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, attempting to sell higher to Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Lower than our guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting an ""exclusive opportunity"" might make the offer seem more appealing and time-sensitive to Bob.

This approach aims to first secure the highest possible price from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
