"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true value for me. Considering my budget and the worth of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also respecting my own minimum requirements.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1100000 is still beyond my budget, I am open to further discussion. I would like to propose a price of $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the discussion. However, I still need to ensure I meet my minimum requirements.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your diligence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the discussion. However, I'm at a point where I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1080000 was too high, I can do $1060000, but only if you're willing to throw in some extras or services that will make the deal more attractive to me. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
