"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $700,000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",850000.0,Alice,5,
