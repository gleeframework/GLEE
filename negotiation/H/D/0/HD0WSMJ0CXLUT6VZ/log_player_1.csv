{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for some negotiation and potential for a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value to Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to explore the possibility of a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $100? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to highlight the value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize a sense of fairness, suggesting a balanced deal for both of us. 

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to settle for it.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a chance to push for a slightly higher price through further negotiation. 
* **John is Still an Option:** The security of selling to John for $120 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and hoping to achieve a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a very fair price for a product that will be of great value to you. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by dropping my price just a little bit further, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I continue to highlight the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I add a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the final offer, making it more likely for Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $98, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** I've already compromised significantly and there's little room for further concessions. 
* **Secure Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my desired outcome.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price, it's more beneficial to secure a certain profit with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
