Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I still have time to negotiate and can always sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
