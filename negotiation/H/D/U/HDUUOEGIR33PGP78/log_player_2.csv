"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  That's a significant savings for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price further."
