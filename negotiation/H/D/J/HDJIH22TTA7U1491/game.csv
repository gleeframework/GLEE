"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and the original price I was thinking of. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $9500. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to sell the product for $9500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $10000, which is the price I was initially thinking of selling it to John for. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
