"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,250,000 is still too low. How about $1,350,000? It's a compromise, and a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough choice. While I'd love to get closer to $1,400,000, I'm running out of rounds and Bob's offer is a decent compromise. Accepting this deal secures me a solid profit and avoids the risk of a lower price from John or a complete breakdown in negotiations with Bob."
