Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $130 is higher than $80, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $130 is still above your $150 minimum, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By starting at $130, you have room to lower the price a bit if necessary to secure the deal. 

Remember, the goal is to earn as much as possible, but it's also important to keep the negotiation open and try to find a price that is mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is above Bob's initial valuation and would bring in some profit, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** $120 is still above my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Bridge the gap:**  It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial deal. 

By offering a slightly lower price but still above my minimum, I hope to incentivize Bob to accept the deal and finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. 

I'm confident that John will buy the product, and it's more important for me to reach my minimum profit goal.  Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
