"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $115? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose $112 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $112 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll take $113.50 for the product.  This seems like a fair compromise.",113.5,Alice,5,
