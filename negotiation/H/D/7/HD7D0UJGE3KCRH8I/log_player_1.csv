Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

By offering a slightly higher price than Bob might be willing to pay initially, I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, I get a good price.
* **Start the negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or become too time-consuming, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  This will give me the chance to counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $100 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still give me a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired price point. I also highlight the fairness of the offer and try to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance:

* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** I'm not immediately rejecting Bob's offer, showing that I'm interested in a deal.
* **Allows for further negotiation:** If Bob still isn't willing to pay $110, there's still room to move a bit lower.
* **Protects my minimum price:** $110 is still above my minimum, so I'm not losing out on a good deal."
