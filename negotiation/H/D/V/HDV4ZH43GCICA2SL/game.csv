"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I'm confident this product will yield returns far beyond that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
