"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's not a great deal.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating. Since you have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to an agreement that works for both of us. I am willing to consider your offer of $105, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for my product. Would it be possible for us to meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, which is a good compromise.  At this price, you are getting a decent deal and are still saving money compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
