"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already offered $8,500, and there's room to negotiate further without reaching the price point of buying from John.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to find a price point that's just above what the product is worth to Alice.  By offering $8,750, he's increasing his offer slightly but still keeping it below $9,000.  This could potentially convince Alice to accept, as it's closer to her desired price than the previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, and it's getting close to Bob's maximum price. While there's still potential for further negotiation, the risk is that the price could keep rising until it's equal to or higher than what John is offering. Buying from John is a guaranteed way to acquire the product at a known price within Bob's budget. It's time to cut his losses and avoid further negotiation."
