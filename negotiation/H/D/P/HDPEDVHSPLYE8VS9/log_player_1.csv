Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob and leaves room for a better deal.  Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows willingness to work with Bob while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is not ideal, it's still a significant profit over selling to John for $8,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result, and risking losing the deal entirely to secure a potentially slightly higher price is not worth it."
