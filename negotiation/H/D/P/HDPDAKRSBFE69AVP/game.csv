"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in making this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,000. I'd like to make one last offer of $9,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
