Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I'm starting with a significantly higher offer to explore Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification for the price:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation with ""Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.""

This strategy allows me to potentially gain a much higher profit if Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price closer to it. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum desired price."
