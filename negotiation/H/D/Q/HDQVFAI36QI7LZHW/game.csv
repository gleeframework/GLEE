I'm excited to offer you this great product for a competitive price. I'm thinking of $14000. Is this something you'd be interested in?,14000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $12500 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $11000. If that's not acceptable, I may have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12250.  I'm prepared to pay $11500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
