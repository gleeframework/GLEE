"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal.  I want to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm hoping to save even more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is close to my ideal price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me ending up paying $1,200,000 to John is too high. Accepting Alice's offer at $925,000 allows me to acquire the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
