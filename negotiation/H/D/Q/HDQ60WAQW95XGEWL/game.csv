"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, but I'm going to need a lower price to make it work for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
