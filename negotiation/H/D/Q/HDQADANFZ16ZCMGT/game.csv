,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget.  While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $145 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to accept $150 for the product. This is a final offer, as I'm happy to sell it to John for the same price.",150.0,Alice,5,
