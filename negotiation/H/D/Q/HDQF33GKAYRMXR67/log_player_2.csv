"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for $12000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do better than $9500. How about $11000? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. Although it's closer to Bob's limit, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to see if Alice will go lower before accepting or purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $10,000.  Would you consider that final price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is tempting, it's still above Bob's budget of $10,000. Since Bob has already made it clear he won't go above that limit, it's worth trying to negotiate one more time to see if Alice will lower her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I really can't go higher than $10,000.  That's my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're at your limit, Bob. I'm not willing to go below $10000, but I can try to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10250? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $10,250, it's still above Bob's absolute limit of $10,000.  At this point, with only a few rounds left, Bob has made it clear he won't go higher, and Alice seems unwilling to meet his price.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 and save the remaining rounds for potential future negotiations."
