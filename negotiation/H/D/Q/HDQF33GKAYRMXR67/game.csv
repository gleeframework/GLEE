"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do better than $9500. How about $11000? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $10000.  Would you consider that final price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I really can't go higher than $10000.  That's my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
