"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  To be totally honest with you,  $10,000 is the absolute most I can justify spending on this. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,4,
