"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would that be feasible?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming higher, I could be persuaded to come down to $15,500. This is a very competitive price considering the value you'll be getting. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting pretty close.  I'm willing to make one last move - would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. My final offer is $14,250. This is a significant discount on its true value, and I won't be able to go any lower. Let me know your decision.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I can do $13,500.  Take it or leave it.",13500.0,Bob,8,
