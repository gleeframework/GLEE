"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130.
