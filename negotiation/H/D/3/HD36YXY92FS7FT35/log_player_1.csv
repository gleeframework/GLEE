Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to set a high bar initially to maximize potential profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,800,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and a significant increase from Bob's last offer.

We're down to the final rounds, and Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a good price.  It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's important to avoid being too stubborn and risk missing out on a good deal altogether."
