"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to me is $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's still significantly less than your valuation of $12,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. My current assessment of the product's value remains at $12,000. However, I am willing to consider a compromise. How about $9,500? This still allows for a significant profit while being more reasonable than my initial asking price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering it's a good deal for you and within my budget. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
