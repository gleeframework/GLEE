This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm flexible and interested in finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,250?  That's closer to your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price given the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the original price you were asking 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,800 is close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  Jhon is offering me my minimum price, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
