"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to work with you. We're willing to offer you a competitive price of $9000 for the product. We believe this is a great starting point, and we're open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's price, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering a new price of $8500 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise, considering its value to us and to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a lower price than the initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price, he still has rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your flexibility. While I appreciate the lower price, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating our pricing strategy, we're willing to make one more concession. We're offering a new price of $8200 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise, considering its value to us and to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has already lowered her price significantly, and Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal than John's offer.  There's a good chance Alice won't drop her price further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer of $8,200 allows Bob to secure a good price without risking losing the product."
