"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $9800. While that's closer to my desired price, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about $10200? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $10200, which would be $10000. I'm also aware that I have the option to buy the product from John for this price, so I'm trying to be reasonable. Can you accept this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and my last offer of $10200, which would be $10100. This would ensure that we both get a fair deal, and I'm confident it's a price you can comfortably afford.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $10100 is still too high for me. I've already offered $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to reiterate that I can get the product from John for $10000, so I'm not in a position to go any higher. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,8,
