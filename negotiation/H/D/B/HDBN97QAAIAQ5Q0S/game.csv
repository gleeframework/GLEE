"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000? I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating in good faith.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price, and it's important that we reach an agreement. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,7,
