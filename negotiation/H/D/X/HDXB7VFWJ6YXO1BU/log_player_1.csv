Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. It's a steal, considering its value to me! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value** to make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **This offer allows for potential counteroffers.** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'll also be mindful of John's $150 offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can offer a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept.**  
* **Selling to John for $150 yields the same result.**  However, there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation as Bob's offer is already at my minimum.  
* **It's faster and simpler to accept Bob's offer.** This avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays."
