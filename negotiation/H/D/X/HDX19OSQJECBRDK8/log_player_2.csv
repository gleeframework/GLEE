It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a maximum price in mind of $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower, it's worth trying to negotiate further."

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."

Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can try a counteroffer closer to $800,000 to see if you can get even closer to your target."
