"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $850000 is still too far below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which reflects both the value I see in it and your need for a fair price. This offer is my best, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise and keeps us both within reasonable margins. Let's reach a deal on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and allows us both to benefit. This is my final offer. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
