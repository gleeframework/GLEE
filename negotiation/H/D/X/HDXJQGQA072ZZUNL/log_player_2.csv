"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $170 is way above his maximum budget of $100. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he starts by offering his maximum price of $100. This is a strong opening position and allows for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can push for a lower price closer to $100.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $100 to $110, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still within his budget, but also demonstrates his seriousness about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still not ideal.  At this point, Bob has already negotiated and it's likely Alice won't budge much further. Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price and allows Bob to avoid further negotiation."
