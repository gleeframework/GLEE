"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be very happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
