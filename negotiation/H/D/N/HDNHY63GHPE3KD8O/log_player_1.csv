Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John's $10,000 offer, ensuring she doesn't settle for less than her minimum."
