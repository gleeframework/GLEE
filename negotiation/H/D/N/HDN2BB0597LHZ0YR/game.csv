"I understand that $20000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $22500. This is my best offer, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",22500.0,Alice,3,

"I've already offered you $22500, and you're asking me to go down to $20000? I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $21500. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",21500.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made two concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than $21500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $22500. I'm not budging on the price, but I'm willing to add this extra value to make the deal more attractive. This is my final offer.",21500.0,Alice,7,

"I've already offered you a premium service package worth $1000, and you're still not willing to meet me at $21500? I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one last attempt to compromise. I'll throw in another $500 worth of extras, making the total value $22000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product and the service package.",22000.0,Alice,9,
