"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair starting point that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $795,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
