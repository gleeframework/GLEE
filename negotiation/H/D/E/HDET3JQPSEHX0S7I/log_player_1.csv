Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go as low as $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While a higher price would be ideal, Bob has drawn a hard line. Accepting his offer of $1,100,000 is the most profitable decision at this point.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away completely, leaving us with John's lower offer."
