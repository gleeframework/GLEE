"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where negotiation is possible.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's worth, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even at this price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible. By starting high, I can potentially extract more value from Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses. If we fail to reach an agreement, I have the option to sell to John and secure my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering I have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for such a low price.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired value, but still open to negotiation. I have nine rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also presenting a counteroffer that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a ""profitable deal for both of us"", which could make Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  I'm moving my price down significantly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's close to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more moderate approach with my counteroffer. By offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to start a more constructive dialogue. If he rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $900,000. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $900,000 is still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a significant financial loss. I am willing to negotiate but need to ensure that the deal is beneficial for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer again and counter with a price that is more reasonable, but still closer to my desired value. I'm confident that with further negotiation, we can find a mutually agreeable price. However, I will keep John's offer as a backup in case the negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000. However, I'm justifying this move by emphasizing the ""caliber"" of the product, implying that the price is still fair.
* **Profit Margin:** I'm highlighting the potential for a ""substantial profit margin"" for Bob, which could make him more inclined to accept my offer.
* **Finding a Solution:** I'm using positive language like ""find a solution"" to emphasize my desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Strategy:**

By further lowering my price but maintaining a strong justification, I'm aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. If he rejects this offer, I have a few more rounds to work with before potentially accepting John's offer.  I'm hoping to avoid that outcome, though, and close the deal with Bob at a price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting the value it holds.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement compared to his previous offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept an offer that would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation. I have four rounds left, and I believe I can still achieve a better deal. I will continue to emphasize the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.  If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth while also being fair to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Interest:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest by saying ""I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.""  This keeps the negotiation positive and shows that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm again showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000, but I'm justifying the price by referencing the ""true worth"" of the product.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""make this happen"" to express my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still maintaining a strong justification for the value of the product. By approaching this negotiation from a ""win-win"" perspective, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my offer.  If he rejects this offer, I will need to make a decision in the next round whether to accept his next offer or move on to John's offer."
