Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since I think you'll find value in it. I'm asking for $95. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($80) might make him immediately reject the offer.  $95 is a reasonable markup that might still be appealing.
* **Justification:**  The message hints that Bob is getting a preferred deal and subtly implies the product might be worth this higher price. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price or eventually accept John's offer of $80, ensuring she never sells below her minimum."
