Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
