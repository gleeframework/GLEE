Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") without revealing your bottom line. This might make Bob think the product is worth more than he initially thought. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest.  If he flat-out rejects it, you can always lower the price closer to his perceived value or move on to John."
