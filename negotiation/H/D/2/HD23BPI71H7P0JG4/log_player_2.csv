"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $120.  Rejecting the offer allows us to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

We're starting with a lower price, aiming to get closer to our maximum value of $100. This gives us room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to our maximum, we can still try to negotiate a better price. We're only two rounds away from being able to buy from John for $100, so it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

We're increasing our offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise but still staying below our maximum. This could encourage Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is only $2 above our maximum. With only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking that we won't be able to get a lower price, especially since we can buy from John for $100. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
