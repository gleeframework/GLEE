,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,100,000? It's a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a price you're comfortable with and me getting a fair price for my product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
