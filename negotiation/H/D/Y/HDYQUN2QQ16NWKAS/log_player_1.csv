"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get close to my desired price. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone can help encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the quality of the product to justify the price. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. I'm aiming to get a good price while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150.  While I could accept and make a quick sale, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit at this point. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range. I still have 8 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle of our initial offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to reconsider.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the quality and value of the product,  hoping to justify my price point.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping a positive tone to keep the negotiation going. 

My goal is to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us while still being profitable for myself."
