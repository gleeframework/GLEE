"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob should aim for a lower price. There are 9 more rounds, so he can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to gauge Alice's flexibility.  He's aiming for a price closer to his $15,000 ""walk-away"" point with John, but leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and 9 rounds remain.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price. He's showing that he's serious about buying but is still trying to get a good deal. By offering $11,000, he's bridging the gap while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11250. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly indicated this is her final offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially making a higher offer later is too great. At $11,250, Bob is getting a good deal compared to John's $15,000 offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
