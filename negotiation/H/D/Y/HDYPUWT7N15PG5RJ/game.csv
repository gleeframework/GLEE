"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your effort to meet in the middle. However,  $8,500 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,800. This is my final offer, I'm really hoping we can close this deal.",8800.0,Alice,5,
