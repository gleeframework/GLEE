Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a good compromise and hopefully fair to us both.

I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to find a price we can both agree on.  Let's split the difference - $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk further negotiations with Bob that may not result in a higher price."
