``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but still lower than the product's value for Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's very close to it. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a significant profit, which is more important than holding out for a potentially higher price that might not materialize."
