"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a quality item at a price that's still beneficial to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is worse than buying from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Price:** $11,000
* **John's Price:** $10,000
* **Your Maximum:** $10,000

You should reject Alice's offer because it's above your maximum price and John offers a better deal.
