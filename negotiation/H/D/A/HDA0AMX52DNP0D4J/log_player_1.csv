Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still earning significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows the negotiation to progress without immediately forcing you to deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer. While I could accept it and secure a sale, it's not a good outcome for me.  I need to push for a better price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than his previous offer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. There's a good chance that a counteroffer could lead to a price closer to my goal, and it's still not too late to sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation fails."
