"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it, but I also have another interested buyer who is willing to pay top dollar for it. I'm willing to make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think you'll get a great return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better price, or you can always fall back on John's offer."
