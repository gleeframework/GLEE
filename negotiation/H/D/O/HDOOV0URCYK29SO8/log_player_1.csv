Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, I start with a high offer of $20,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the ""true value and potential,"" I'm framing the offer in a way that might make Bob reconsider his initial valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm secure knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I am prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. My ultimate goal is to find a price that works for both of us while maximizing my profit."
