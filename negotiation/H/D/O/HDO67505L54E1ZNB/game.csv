"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a substantial discount for you and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
