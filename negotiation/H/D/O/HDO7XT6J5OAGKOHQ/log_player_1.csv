Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly imply the product is desirable and others might be willing to pay more. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  You're not giving an ultimatum. You're asking ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a little steep. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know John will pay $10,000, Bob doesn't. This information asymmetry works in your favor.
* **Negotiation is Fluid:** This initial offer is just the beginning. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob seems interested but hesitant. Your goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of you."
