"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by me due to its unique features and high-quality materials. Considering its worth and benefits, I propose a price of $95 for you to experience all it has to offer.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $95 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its worth to me.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within my valuation range. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $85. To ensure both fairness and profitability in this transaction, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in it. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from John for $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",87.0,Bob,4,
