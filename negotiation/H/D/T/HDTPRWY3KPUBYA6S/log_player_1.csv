"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to me (without giving away my minimum) can make the price seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept the initial offer, but I'm prepared for a counteroffer. I'll then use the subsequent rounds to either negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me or switch to John if it seems unlikely I'll reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I can potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Time to Counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and guide the negotiation in a direction that benefits me.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired range but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting this offer as a compromise to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Middle Ground:** Meeting in the middle between our initial offers is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob (""good deal"") to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal. I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case he needs to counter again, but I'm confident that $90 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm seeing some progress in the negotiations, and I believe we are close to finding a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Time for Another Counter:** I'll make another counteroffer, trying to nudge the price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming to secure a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $88? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount to show my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm again emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" to both parties.  
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm framing this offer as a way to bridge the remaining gap between our current positions.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this small increment will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and might consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential profit margin is shrinking, and the likelihood of a successful deal is uncertain.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is increasing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and provides certainty.

**Strategy:**

Considering the limited time remaining and the diminishing profit potential, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
