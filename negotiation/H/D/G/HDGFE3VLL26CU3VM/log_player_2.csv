"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. There's no point in accepting it. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first, and if that fails, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $8,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within the range where I believe Alice might be willing to negotiate. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my $10,000 limit. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating to get a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still sticking to my budget. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for Alice, but I'm also prepared to potentially walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my budget. I will continue negotiating to get a better price. I am still confident that I can secure the product for less than $10,000 with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $9,500. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm getting closer to her price. This offer is still within my budget, and it demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  I have only 3 rounds left before I have to decide to buy from John.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final counteroffer at $10,000. This is my absolute limit and I'm confident that Alice is willing to accept this offer. She's clearly moving towards my price and has already lowered her offer significantly. I believe the product is worth more to her than $10,000, and I'm hoping she sees the value in closing the deal."
