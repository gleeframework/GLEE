Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's highly interested. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how motivated Bob is to buy or if he has other options. There's a risk he'll reject the offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If a quick sale is important, a slightly lower offer might be preferable to waiting for John."
