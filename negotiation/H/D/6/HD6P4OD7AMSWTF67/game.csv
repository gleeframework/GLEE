"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000. It's my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already had another buyer interested in the product, and I need to consider that. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
