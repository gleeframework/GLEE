Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to walk away if this price isn't acceptable to you.

While Bob's latest offer is closer to my minimum, it's clear he's unwilling to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to me.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
