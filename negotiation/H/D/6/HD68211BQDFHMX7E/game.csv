"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This reflects the significant potential this product holds for your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I can go up to $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm demonstrating my commitment to making this deal happen.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment. To be candid, my alternative buyer is offering closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This presents a significant opportunity for you, and I encourage you to consider it carefully.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any higher.",750000.0,Bob,6,
