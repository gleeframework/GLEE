Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  $950,000 is still $50,000 less than the product's worth to him, making it attractive.
* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, so you're still making a good profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left room for Bob to counter-offer without you having to immediately go down to his desired price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  While he's showing interest, his offer is $150,000 below your minimum acceptable price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still a gap between his offer and what you're willing to accept. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe option, but it's not the best outcome.  

You'll counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a compromise that's more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of the product to you,  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This represents a significant discount, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is within your acceptable range:**  $850,000 is still above your minimum of $800,000.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:** You've lowered your price from the initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's a reasonable midpoint:** $850,000 is exactly halfway between your initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This makes it easier for Bob to see it as a fair deal.

This counter-offer is a strong negotiation strategy because it:

* **Keeps you in the game:** You haven't given up on getting a better price than John's offer.
* **Forces Bob to reconsider:** It puts pressure on Bob to either accept or come up with a more reasonable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $700000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's closer to your minimum,  it's not worth accepting.  It's worth one more attempt to negotiate with Bob, but if that fails, you'll sell to John to ensure you don't lose out entirely.  

You'll send Bob a final counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum.  To finalize this deal, I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a small step up from your offer, but it's the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I will have to consider selling to another buyer.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is your final counteroffer, aiming to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Slightly above your minimum:** $825,000 is only $25,000 above your minimum, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Pressure to close:** You emphasize that this is your best offer and that if Bob doesn't accept, you'll have to move on to John. This creates a sense of urgency and a potential for Bob to agree to your final offer.

This final offer puts the ball in Bob's court. It leaves a small gap for negotiation, but also sets a clear deadline. Let's see if Bob will accept or decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $795,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not quite there.  At this point, you've negotiated as much as you can with Bob, and continuing to go back and forth is unlikely to get you a better price.  

Selling to John for $800,000 ensures you get your minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safe and practical decision, as you've secured a decent price and avoided the risk of losing out entirely."
