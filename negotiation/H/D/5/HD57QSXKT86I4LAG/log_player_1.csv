"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial offer allows for a few rounds of negotiation before potentially resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is higher:**  While $130 is a decent price, I still have room to aim for something closer to $140. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There are still 8 rounds left. It's worth trying to push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:**  I have John as a safety net, so I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great price for a product worth $150 to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making $135 seem like a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's close this deal"" adds a bit of pressure to encourage a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might counter again, but with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing him.
* **John as backup:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still sell to John for $120. This gives me some security in accepting Bob's offer."
