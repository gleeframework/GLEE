"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen. How about we settle at $875,000? This reflects the product's true value.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $780,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,4,
