Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still less than I'd like. How about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $95, but that's really pushing my budget.  Do you think we could make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
