{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $120.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

You're starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $120. This shows you're serious about negotiating but also willing to pay a fair price.  There's still room for further bargaining if Alice rejects this offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer of $130. While it's still within your budget, it's important to keep pushing for a better price. You have rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer will allow you to counter again and potentially secure a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice keeps raising her price, which isn't helpful.  While $145 is still within your budget, it's closer to John's price. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as you have rounds left.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter again and try to reach a deal that's more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your upper limit. This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but it's still below her current offer. It's a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice while still saving you some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice keeps increasing her offer, and it's getting very close to John's price. With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is high. It's more beneficial to secure the product from John for a price you're comfortable with, even though it's slightly higher than your desired target.  You're guaranteed the product and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might not be successful."
