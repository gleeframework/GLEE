Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This gives you a significant advantage while allowing me to get a fair return. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a substantial value, and it allows me to get closer to what this product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive to make this work.  Would you consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $975,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,012,500. This would mean we both compromise a little, and we can hopefully reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal happen.  How about we settle at $995,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $995,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it.  We only have four rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 and ensure I get a good return on the product."
