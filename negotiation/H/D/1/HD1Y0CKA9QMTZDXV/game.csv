"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This gives you a significant advantage while allowing me to get a fair return. Let's start the conversation!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a substantial value, and it allows me to get closer to what this product is worth to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive to make this work.  Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $975,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,012,500. This would mean we both compromise a little, and we can hopefully reach a final agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal happen.  How about we settle at $995,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",995000.0,Bob,6,
