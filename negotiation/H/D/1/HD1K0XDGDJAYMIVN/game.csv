"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts and a potential counteroffer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and propose a price of $1750000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and is still a fair price for this valuable product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your revised offer, I would like to counter with $1650000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
