"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
