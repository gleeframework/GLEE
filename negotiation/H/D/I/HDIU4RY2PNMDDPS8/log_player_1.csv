"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell to John just yet.  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob might get frustrated and walk away."
