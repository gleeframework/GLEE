Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. I'll offer the product to him for $1,200,000. This is a good starting point, as it's still a significant discount from the product's true value of $1,500,000 to Bob.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is a bit higher than my initial offer, but still lower than the product's true value to him. I'll decide to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1300000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to the product's true value to him, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get an even better price.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $1,280,000. This is a slight increase from his offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me at this price.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1280000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
