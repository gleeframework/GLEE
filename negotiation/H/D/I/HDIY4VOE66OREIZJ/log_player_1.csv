{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It also expresses confidence in the value of the product while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still below what you're hoping to get. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount and see if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I believe the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects both the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite there yet. Would you be willing to meet me at $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to your desired price point and is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
