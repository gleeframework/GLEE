"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a good starting point, I believe the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which reflects both the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
