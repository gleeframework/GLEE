"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $700,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $650,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $675,000. It's getting close to the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",675000.0,Alice,5,
