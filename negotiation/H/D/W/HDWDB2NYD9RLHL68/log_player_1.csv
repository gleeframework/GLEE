"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to maximize my profit. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum threshold. While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is too far below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
