Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to walking away, Bob. I'll make one last offer: $122. That's as low as I can go, but I really think you'll love this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below her current offer of $122, and John offers the product for $120.  We've gotten a feel for Alice's negotiating style and it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
