"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $1000000. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1800000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget of $1000000. Can you consider my offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'll offer you $1700000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll go as low as $1400000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
