"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her original price, it's still higher than your maximum of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price you're comfortable with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find an agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down some, her offer of $9,250 is still higher than your maximum of $8,000. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. You're better off buying the product from John for $8,000 to stay within your budget."
