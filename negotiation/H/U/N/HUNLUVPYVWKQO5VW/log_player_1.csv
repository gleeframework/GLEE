{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a price that benefits both of you.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, but it also limits your potential profit.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is higher than what John is offering, it's still a significant amount lower than your initial offer of $120.  There's room for further negotiation, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a very fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of a significant profit.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my last counteroffer of $110, and it's still higher than what John is offering.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
