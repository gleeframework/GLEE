"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $750000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're willing to go up to $725000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer you the product for $725001. This is a small increment, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.
