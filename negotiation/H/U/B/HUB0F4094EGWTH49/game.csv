"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1400000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This represents a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
