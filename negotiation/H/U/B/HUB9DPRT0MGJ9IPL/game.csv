"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $95.  This would allow me to get the product without going over my budget. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up on the deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
