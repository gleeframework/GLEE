"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to make a slightly more substantial counteroffer. I'm now offering it to you for $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your organization.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $820000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm now offering it to you for $850000, with a small concession. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $835000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I'm confident this price is fair, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.
