{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't directly influence my initial offer.  I want to start high.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high price ($19,000), I'm setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind.  Even though it's above his valuation, it might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This gives me leverage, as I don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening strategy. How I proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the first offer, I'll need to adjust and potentially negotiate closer to his valuation, keeping my bottom line ($15,000) in mind."
