"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I'm offering.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again, and hopefully, we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and it guarantees me a profit."
