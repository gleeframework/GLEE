"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I'm offering.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1300000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1450000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
