Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $99. I believe it's a great deal and worth considering."",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is just below your minimum acceptable price ($100) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** There's a chance Bob might find the deal appealing enough to accept, especially if he perceives the product's value to be slightly higher than $80.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a slight risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll have to settle for selling it to John at $100. However, the potential for a higher profit justifies the attempt to sell at $99 first."
