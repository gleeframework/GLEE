"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, I'm confident this product is worth more given its unique features and market potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not able to meet your current price.  $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This is a significant amount and I believe it reflects the potential of the product, while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
