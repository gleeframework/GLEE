Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, I'm confident this product is worth more given its unique features and market potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not able to meet your current price.  $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This is a significant amount and I believe it reflects the potential of the product, while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
