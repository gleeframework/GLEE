"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This is still within my budget and allows me to acquire the item without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiations and potential rejection, which could lead to me having to sell to John at a lower price."
