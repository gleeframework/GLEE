Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, framing it as a ""great deal"" for him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I ask for Bob's thoughts, indicating that I'm open to negotiation and want to find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that's favorable to me while also being open to reaching a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I can likely get more.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Avoiding settling too quickly:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be the safe option, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer of $9,000, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob to reinforce the attractiveness of the deal.
* **Seeking a compromise:**  I use phrases like ""meet in the middle"" to emphasize the desire to find a mutually agreeable solution and avoid a stalemate. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground, increasing the chances of closing the deal while still earning a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer a bit more,  $9,000 is only $1,000 below my target.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away. 
* **Time and potential loss:** Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or even a loss if he ultimately decides not to buy.

Given the situation, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a sale close to my minimum price."
