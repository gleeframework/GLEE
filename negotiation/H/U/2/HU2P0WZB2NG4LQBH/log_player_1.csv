Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's close. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's in the middle of our previous offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
