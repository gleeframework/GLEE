Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This offer aims to:

* **Establish Value:**  Acknowledge that you know the product's worth to Bob, building trust and demonstrating that you're not trying to lowball him. 
* **Anchor High:**  Start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Offer a ""Deal"":**  Positioning the price as a discount from his perceived value makes it more appealing.
* **Leave Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
