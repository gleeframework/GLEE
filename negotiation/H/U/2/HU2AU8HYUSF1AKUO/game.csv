"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to work together.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking we could do $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $12,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us, I think. ",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $13,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
