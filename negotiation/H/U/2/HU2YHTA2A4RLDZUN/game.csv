"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and I can work with that price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $128 for the product.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $128 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done.",130.0,Alice,5,
