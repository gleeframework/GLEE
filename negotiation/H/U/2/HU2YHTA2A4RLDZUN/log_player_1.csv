"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob some room to bargain, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly opening message sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and I can work with that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the Value:** I emphasize that this price is still a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to accept.
* **Compromise Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $128 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is Close:**  We're getting closer to a deal, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Having John as an option allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $128 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to compromise, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm expressing a desire to ""get this deal done"", subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept."
