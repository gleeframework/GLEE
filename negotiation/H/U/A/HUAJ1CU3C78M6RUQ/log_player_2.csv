"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, hoping to create room for negotiation. This is a bold move, but it reflects my strong desire to save money.  If she rejects, I can always increase my offer slightly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I still have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's close enough to her last offer that she might consider it, but it's still within my budget. If she rejects, I can always go with John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000. This is close enough to my budget and only $1,000 more than what I can get from John. Given the possibility that Alice might not come down further, it's a good time to accept and avoid potentially losing the product."
