"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the price of $14,000. I believe this offer represents significant value given its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Strong:**  I'm aiming slightly above Alice's perceived value ($12,000) but well below her initial asking price. This demonstrates I'm serious but also looking for a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I've left some space for further negotiation if Alice counters. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but ideally, I want to stay closer to $12,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $13,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to push a little further to try and get a better deal. I'm comfortable going slightly above my target if it means securing a significant discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $12,800?"",
""product_price"": 12800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise by increasing my offer, but I'm sticking relatively close to my previous counter-offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer puts us below the midpoint between our last two offers, keeping the momentum moving in my favor.
* **Deadline Awareness:** While I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, I'm also mindful of John's offer. If Alice doesn't budge much, I might have to consider going with him."
