Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still above our minimum acceptable price, Bob is clearly demonstrating price resistance. Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
