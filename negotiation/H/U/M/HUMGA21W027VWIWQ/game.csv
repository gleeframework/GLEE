"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $8500? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $8750? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8625? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8625.0,Bob,4,
