Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer is a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing us closer to our desired profit margin. 
* **Time Value & Guaranteed Sale:** While we have a guaranteed sale with John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
