"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above your budget, so rejecting is the logical first step. You can then counteroffer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still above your budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  You can likely get her down further with another counteroffer.  It's worth seeing if you can reach a compromise before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110, but I was thinking we could go even higher. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now trying to push the price back up. She's clearly unwilling to go below $110. You've reached your limit, and it's time to move on. It's better to go with John's offer of $100 than to risk getting stuck in a negotiation cycle that won't end in your favor."
