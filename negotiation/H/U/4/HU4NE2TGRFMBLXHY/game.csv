"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about $700,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
