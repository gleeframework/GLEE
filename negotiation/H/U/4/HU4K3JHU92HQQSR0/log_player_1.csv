"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer, or make a counteroffer that I can then negotiate with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum value, and I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $120. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise compared to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will find this price acceptable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering with $110.  This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum value. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be realistic about the potential for a higher offer, but I'm not willing to sell below $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is finally offering my minimum value of $100.  While I would prefer more, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might not be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds. I'll accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
