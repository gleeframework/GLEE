"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my absolute maximum. It would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $815000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
