Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $115. I think you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

This is a starting point in the negotiation. Here's why:

* **Starting High:** By offering the product at $115, I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but well above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  His response to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his eagerness to buy and his potential price range. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100.  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I have a feeling I might be able to get a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll try countering once.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your counteroffer, Bob, but I can't let go of the product for less than $110. It's a steal at that price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Holding Firm:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and that my initial offer wasn't arbitrary.
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down $5, I'm showing willingness to negotiate but within a limited range. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This counteroffer still ensures a decent profit margin above my minimum. 
* **John Option:** I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open if Bob plays too hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're firm on your price of $110, Alice. I respect that. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tempting offer from Bob. I need to weigh the options:

* **Accepting:**  $105 is a decent profit, better than John's offer.
* **Rejecting & Countering:** There's a risk Bob walks away, and I end up with John's $100 offer. 

Since Bob called it his ""final counteroffer,"" I'm inclined to believe he won't go higher.  I'll take the sure win.
