"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential returns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  We have no information about the product's actual value or Alice's motivation for selling.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is considerably lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident the product will deliver value beyond this price. How about we settle on $1250000? This would still give you a great return on investment, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to our desired price, but it's still higher than our initial counteroffer. We can likely negotiate a lower price still. It's worth trying to push for a lower offer before considering buying from John."
