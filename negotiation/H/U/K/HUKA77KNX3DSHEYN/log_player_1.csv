Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  I want to see if we can reach a middle ground in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer because $13,000 is a good price for me, considering my minimum price is $12,000, and it's a fair compromise with Bob.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
