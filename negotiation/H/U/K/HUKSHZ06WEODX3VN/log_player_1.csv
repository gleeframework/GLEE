``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is more than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
