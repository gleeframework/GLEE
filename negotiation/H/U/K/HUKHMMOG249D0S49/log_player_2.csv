Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or go with John's offer."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting close to John's price."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000. This is a more reasonable counter-offer, closer to Alice's last price, but still within my budget. Hopefully, she'll find this more acceptable."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of a longer negotiation is too high.  It's better to buy from John at a price that's within my limit."
