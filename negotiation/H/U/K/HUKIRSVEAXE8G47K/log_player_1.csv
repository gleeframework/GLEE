Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is below my minimum threshold, and I still believe the product has a higher value. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
