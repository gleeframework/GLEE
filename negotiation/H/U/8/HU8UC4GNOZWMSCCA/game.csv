"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe we can still reach a fair agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,500,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000.  Would you be open to a price of $1,350,000?  I believe this strikes a more equitable balance.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. However, based on my financial situation, I can't commit to $1,350,000. Would you consider bringing the price down to $1,300,000? I believe this might help us reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
