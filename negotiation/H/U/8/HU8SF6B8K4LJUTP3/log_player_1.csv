Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This reflects its unique features and potential benefits. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to explore if you can get a higher price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,500,000 to find common ground. This still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1500000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point.  However, I want to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000 before settling.  I have more rounds and there's still a chance of a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to continue working towards a solution.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and we are getting into the later rounds.  While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal considering my minimum is $1,200,000.  It's safer to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and John."
