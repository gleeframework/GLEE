"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it allows me to recoup most of my investment.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000?  This still allows you to save money, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand that. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
