"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good price. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he has incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is now my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  There's not much room for further negotiation and I don't want to risk running out of rounds."
