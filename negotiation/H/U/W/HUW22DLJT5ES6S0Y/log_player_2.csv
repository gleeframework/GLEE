"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has a higher upper limit of $150, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway by lowering her price to $135. This is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John."
