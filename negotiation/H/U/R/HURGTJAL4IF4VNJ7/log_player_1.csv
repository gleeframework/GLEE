{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $130 for it, which I think is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $120 for it. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is still a profit for you, it's closer to your minimum. There's room to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob expressed interest.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price.  How about $125? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a small increase:**  Only $5 more than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **It's still below Bob's value:**  He values it at $150, so there's still room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's framed as a compromise:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" makes the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to go up to $120 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come back to his original offer, and while it's not ideal, it's still a profit for me.  It's likely that we've reached an impasse.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and is the best course of action at this point."
