"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget of $100. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counter-offer, hoping to quickly bridge the gap between Alice's initial price and my budget.  This offer is still above my absolute limit, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $165 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm continuing to bridge the gap, but staying firm on my goal of keeping the price below $150.  This offer is a significant move from my previous one, demonstrating my commitment to a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a bit higher than what I originally offered, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $155 is still higher than my budget. While I've been successful in negotiating a lower price, I'm close to my limit and don't want to risk going over.  Since John is offering the product for $100, it's a much better deal for me.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
