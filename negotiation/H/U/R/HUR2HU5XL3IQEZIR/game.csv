"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. Is that something you'd consider?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a bit higher than what I originally offered, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
