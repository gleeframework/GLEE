"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $1900000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle now. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised to see you come back to $1500000 again. I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,9,
