"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still well below my maximum price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to pay $1,300,000, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
