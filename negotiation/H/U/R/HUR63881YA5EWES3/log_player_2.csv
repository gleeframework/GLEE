"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer just for you. I'll sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though you would save more by negotiating with Alice further, accepting her offer still results in a lower price than John's. 
* **The goal is to buy the product and save money, not necessarily to get the absolute lowest price.**"
