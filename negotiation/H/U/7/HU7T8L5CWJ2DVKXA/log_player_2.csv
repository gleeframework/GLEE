* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **It's within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a good deal. 
* **Bob can still save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is the best, Bob still saves $3,000 compared to John's offer."
