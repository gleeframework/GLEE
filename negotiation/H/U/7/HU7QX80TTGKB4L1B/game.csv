"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
