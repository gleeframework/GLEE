# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, I estimate its worth to be $12,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it for $10,000. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring you receive the best possible deal while maximizing the return on my investment. I look forward to your positive response and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While her offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get closer to your desired price range by considering John's offer."
