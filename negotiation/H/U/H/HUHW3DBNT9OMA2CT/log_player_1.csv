Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** I want to maximize my profit, so aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($120) is ideal.
* **First offer:** Offering $115 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also demonstrates my value for the product. 
* **John as backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob without settling for a price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, I can still try to get a better price through further negotiation.
* **John as safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 allows me to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob without fear of losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $110 splits the difference between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room in the price, which keeps the negotiation open."
