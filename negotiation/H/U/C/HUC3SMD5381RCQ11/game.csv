"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $11,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet halfway.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $10,000, so I'd like to propose $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence!  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
