"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a little high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $11,500. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for negotiation.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we possibly settle around $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is my final offer as it's cutting close to my bottom line, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but that price is still a little too high for me. I could meet you halfway at $8,250. That's a fair offer considering your starting point and my budget.",8250.0,Bob,6,
