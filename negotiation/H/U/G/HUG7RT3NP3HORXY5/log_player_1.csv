Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his first offer, it's still significantly below what I consider fair. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a more acceptable price. I have a few rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000.

While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still too far below my minimum price.  I have a few rounds left before I need to consider selling to John. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $920,000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're down to the last few rounds.  I've given him a fair amount of leeway, but it's clear that he won't budge much further. Rather than risk losing out on a much higher price with John, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell him the product."
