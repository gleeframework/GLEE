Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and is still a better price for me than selling to John. I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable price and accepts."
