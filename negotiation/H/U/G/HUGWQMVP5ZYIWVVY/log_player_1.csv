Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit margin for me. It's better to secure the sale than to risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
