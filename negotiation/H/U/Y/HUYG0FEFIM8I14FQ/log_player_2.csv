"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $120 is a bit high, and we have room to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than $120, it's still above my target.  I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, but still need to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price. I'll offer it to you for $115. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm not going to pay $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price we can both agree on. How about $110? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already offered you $110 in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go back on that. I'll stick with my previous offer of $115. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is insistent on her price, and we're close to the end of rounds. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a deal altogether. I'll buy the product from John for $150, which is still within my budget and ensures I don't miss out on the product."
