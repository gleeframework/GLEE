"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still a bit expensive for Bob.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to work with, so there's plenty of room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and would allow us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there are still 7 rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation and the potential for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably commit to right now.  I'm willing to offer $775,000 for the product. This would represent a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our discussions so far.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $812,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high, and Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate. With 5 rounds remaining, there's room to try and secure an even better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise, $812,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $790,000 for the product. This price is a significant step closer to our respective goals, and I believe it presents a viable solution for both of us. Let's reach a mutually agreeable outcome."", ""product_price"": 790000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $805,000 is the lowest she's gone so far, and it's very close to Bob's desired price point. With only three rounds left, it's a good risk/reward situation. If Bob rejects, there's a chance the price could go up again, and he could end up paying more.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase at a price that's significantly less than what John is offering."
