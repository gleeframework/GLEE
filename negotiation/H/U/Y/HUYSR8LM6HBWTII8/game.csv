"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and would allow us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably commit to right now.  I'm willing to offer $775,000 for the product. This would represent a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our discussions so far.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise, $812,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $790,000 for the product.
