"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This is an initial offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  However, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is too low. I'm aiming for at least $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving room for profit. I believe $18,000 is a fair compromise, considering my minimum price is $15,000 and Bob's offer was $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not happy with $14,000. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I won't accept anything below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down to $16,000. I'm hopeful this is a reasonable price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. He's not willing to budge much higher than $13,500, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $15,000. To guarantee a profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
