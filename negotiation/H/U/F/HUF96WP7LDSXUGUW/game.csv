"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting,  $1,200,000  doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits, and I wouldn't want to devalue it. Would you consider $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
