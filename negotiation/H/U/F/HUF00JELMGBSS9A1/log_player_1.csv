Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,999. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 9999} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $10,000,  offering it to Bob slightly below this price could result in a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves a small window open for Bob to potentially counter-offer, even if it's just a token amount above his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** The high price coupled with the knowledge that I have another buyer lined up might encourage Bob to act quickly."
