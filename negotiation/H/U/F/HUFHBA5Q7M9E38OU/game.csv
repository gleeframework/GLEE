"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $95 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,4,
