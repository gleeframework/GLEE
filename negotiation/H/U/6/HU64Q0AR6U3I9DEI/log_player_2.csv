Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower. I can offer the product to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I can offer the product to you for $92. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice has increased her offer after previously lowering it, signaling she might not be willing to go much lower. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $80. It's more beneficial to cut our losses and buy from John to ensure we stay within our budget."")
