"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's far less than what I'd be able to get from another buyer.  To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is fair given the product's potential and your interest in it.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a compromise: $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant discount from your original offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final offer is $1,025,000. This price is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose one more counteroffer: $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant discount from your original offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
