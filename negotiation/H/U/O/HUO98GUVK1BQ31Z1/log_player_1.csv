Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects it, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or decide to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure the product is worth $10,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't accept his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make some profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John.  I'm not willing to risk losing the chance to sell to John for a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
