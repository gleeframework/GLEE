"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $700,000? That's the highest I can go.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is enough to let the product go. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my last offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
