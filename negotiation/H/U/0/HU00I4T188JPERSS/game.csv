"While I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
