"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, so I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to try to get a better price from him.  While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's also the price John is offering. If Bob doesn't accept this, I'm ready to move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to counter again, but this time I'll go down to $1,100,000. I'm still hoping to get a higher price, but I need to be realistic.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 
I'm going to lower my offer to $1,100,000. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept.  If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still getting a good profit. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached the end of the negotiation with Bob. He's not willing to go any higher, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to accept John's offer for $1,200,000.  It's not the best outcome, but it's better than settling for a price lower than my minimum."
