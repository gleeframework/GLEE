{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll drop another $100,000 in a single round.  You're better off securing the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
