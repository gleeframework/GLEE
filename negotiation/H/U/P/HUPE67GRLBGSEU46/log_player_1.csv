"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the product's value and create a good atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  While the price is high, it's not unrealistic, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like the offer is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to keep negotiating with him to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer right now."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's unique value and potential for Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm stating that I'm open to further discussion, while also conveying that this is my current best offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump for me.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option. I need to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and potential for Bob's business.
* **Urgency:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by stating this is a one-time offer. This may encourage Bob to accept before I decide to sell to John."
