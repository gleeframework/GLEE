"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above my budget and what the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $200 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer ($80) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves me room to increase my offer gradually.
* **Polite and Direct:** My message is polite and respectful while clearly stating that the initial price is too high.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to get the product for significantly less than John's $100 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $160 is still too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm mindful that John's offer is looking more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer ($80) and Alice's last offer ($160). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I want to save money, I'm increasing my offer to show I'm serious and move the negotiation along.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's $100 offer in mind. If Alice doesn't come down significantly soon, I may have to take that option."
