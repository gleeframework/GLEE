"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a competitive price. I believe you'll really love it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do better than $8,500, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on a good deal. How about we stick with $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,250 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
