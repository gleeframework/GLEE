"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $100 is above Bob's maximum price of $80.  Therefore, rejecting the offer is the best option in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a lower offer than his maximum price of $80 to leave room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious interest while still leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his preferred range. Bob wants to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?"", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is aiming to split the difference between his maximum price of $80 and Alice's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to stay within his desired price range. The offer of $82.50 is a small enough step down from Alice's offer to potentially convince her to accept."
