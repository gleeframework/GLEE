Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it sets a reference point that might make his counteroffer higher than it would have been otherwise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. His response will give you valuable information to adjust your strategy in subsequent offers or counteroffers. 

**Important Note:**  While starting high is a strategy, it's crucial to be reasonable. An outrageously high price might discourage Bob from further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value for the product. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for you. 

It's more strategic to reject this low offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but doesn't drastically drop from the previous price.  
* **Still Above Minimum:** $90 keeps the price well above your $80 minimum and closer to Bob's potential maximum.
* **Testing the Waters (again):** This offer aims to find a price point that works for both parties. Bob's response will further indicate his flexibility and willingness to pay closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about splitting the difference again and settling at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not worth the risk:** Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to your minimum price, but it's still below what John is willing to pay. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired profit with no further negotiation risk. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, potentially costing you time and leading to a lower final sale price. 

While there's a chance you could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the certainty of John's offer makes it the more appealing option at this point."
