,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the price I can get it for from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to offer you the product for $140. This price reflects a compromise between our original offers and allows us to move forward with the transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to discuss this further. After considering our previous negotiations, I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $135. This price reflects a fair compromise and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. I hope you find this offer acceptable and look forward to your response.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $130, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
