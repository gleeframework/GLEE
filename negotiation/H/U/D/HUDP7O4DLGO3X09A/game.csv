"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to come down on price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I'm still interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant price drop and a pretty good deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $7,500. If you're okay with that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other option.",7500.0,Bob,6,
