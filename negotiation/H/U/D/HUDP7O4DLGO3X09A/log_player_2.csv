"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Alice's starting price is way too high. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to come down on price?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual top price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** A low counteroffer helps me understand how flexible Alice is on price. If she's willing to move significantly, it suggests we can find a compromise. If not, I can always go up or consider John's offer. 
* **Avoiding Anchoring Bias:** By starting low, I'm trying to avoid being influenced by Alice's high initial offer. This keeps my focus on what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $11,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price without being too aggressive yet. I'll make another counteroffer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I'm still interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer, but staying well below her price and within my $8,000 limit. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go. If she rejects it outright or doesn't move much, I'll seriously consider John's offer.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  It's important to remain courteous and respectful throughout the negotiation, even while being firm about my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm sensing we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant price drop and a pretty good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I might consider, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. I'm only $500 away from John's guaranteed price. I'll make one more counteroffer close to my limit to see if Alice will budge further. If not, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $7,500. If you're okay with that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other option."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer. This puts the ball in Alice's court and signals that I'm serious about my budget.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between her previous offer and mine, showing a willingness to compromise but also holding firm. 
* **Setting a Walk-Away Point:** By mentioning my ""other option"" (John), I'm reminding Alice that I have an alternative if we can't agree on a price. This strengthens my negotiating position."
