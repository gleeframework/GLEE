Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to come down on price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I'm still interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $7,500. If you're okay with that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other option.

Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $7,500 offer, and it's clear he won't reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
