Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it just below my minimum ($11,999) creates the perception of a deal for Bob while maximizing my potential profit. He gets a small ""discount,"" and I make significantly more than selling to John.

**Important Note:** This assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or other factors influencing his willingness to pay."
