"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
