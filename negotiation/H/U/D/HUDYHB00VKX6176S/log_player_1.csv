Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you leverage in setting a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, $100 leaves some space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures you won't go below your minimum acceptable price ($80). 

By starting at $100, you aim for a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your potential earnings."
