"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more to Bob than he currently thinks.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** The high initial price signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also conveys that I believe the product has substantial value.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and potential while leaving the door open for Bob's input."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  This is a fair price, allowing you to make a profit while still remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, I have plenty of room to work with before considering accepting a price that low. I'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I'm reducing my price by $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is calculated to keep me well above both my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the high price, subtly countering Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation too low. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The new price is a significant move, but it aims to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable with $950,000, which allows both of us to gain from this deal. This offer considers the product's value and my financial limitations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still substantially below my $1,200,000 minimum. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, but I'll need to consider selling to John soon if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. However, I do have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my best offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Slight Concession:** The price is slightly above my absolute minimum, allowing for a small concession if Bob negotiates well.
* **Mentioning Other Buyers:**  This subtly reminds Bob that I have other options and won't endlessly negotiate below my threshold. 
* **Direct and Firm:** The message is direct and firm, emphasizing the seriousness of this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate your compromise. While $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and reflects a fair middle ground. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. He's moved up, but his increments are small, and based on his negotiation pattern, it's unlikely he'll reach my acceptable range in the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut my losses. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk or wasted time in negotiation."
