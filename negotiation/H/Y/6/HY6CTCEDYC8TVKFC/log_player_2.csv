"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way too high. It is more than double what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  This is a fair price, allowing you to make a profit while still remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob a better chance of getting the product at a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable with $950,000, which allows both of us to gain from this deal. This offer considers the product's value and my financial limitations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. However, I do have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 6
