"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
