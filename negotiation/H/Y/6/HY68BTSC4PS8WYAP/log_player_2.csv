Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?

You should reject Alice's offer.  $11,000 is still above your budget, and you can likely get a better price.  It's time to counter again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.

You should buy the product from John.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your target of $8,000. You've already negotiated a good amount, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the product at your budget."
