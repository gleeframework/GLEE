"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? I'm sure we can agree on this, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
