Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me above my minimum.
* **Confidence:**  Presenting the offer with confidence about the product's value might encourage Bob to accept a higher price."
