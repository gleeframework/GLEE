"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product, emphasizing the potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm right away.

**Important Considerations:**

* I'm aware that I have a backup option (John) willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me confidence to push for a better price from Bob.
* I'm setting the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob.  This will allow me to assess his willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Profit:** While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired profit. Selling to John would bring in more money.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Exploring Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's willing to go higher.  

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique value and potential, I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing its potential benefits. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this deal happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* I'm keeping in mind that I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails. 
* This counteroffer should push Bob closer to my desired price range, but I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm accepting the offer, I'm not ruling out the possibility of negotiating a slightly higher price in future rounds if the opportunity arises.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of getting a lower price from Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Important Considerations:**

* I have 6 rounds left, which gives me some room to potentially improve the price if necessary.
* I've already established a pattern of compromise and negotiation, which might encourage Bob to be more flexible in the future."
