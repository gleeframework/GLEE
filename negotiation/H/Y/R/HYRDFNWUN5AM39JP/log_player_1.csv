{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, but it's still below the $180 minimum I would accept.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also trying to build a positive relationship with Bob by offering him the product first. If he rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for $120, my goal is to maximize my profit.  Since I have John as a backup buyer at that price, I'm going to try to get a better deal from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $130? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, I'm hoping we could find a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $120 price, and I'm not willing to go lower than that.  While I'd prefer to work with Bob, it's best to close the deal with John now to avoid any further negotiation."
