Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:** I know John will buy the product for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance to get a price higher than $15,000.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still having a safety net with John."
