"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price considering it's closer to my limit, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let me know what you think.",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,800.  This is a fair price considering we're both close to agreeing, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
