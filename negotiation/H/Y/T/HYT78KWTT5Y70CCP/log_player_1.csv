Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price considering it's closer to my limit, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,800.  This is a fair price considering we're both close to agreeing, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,800 is significantly closer to my goal of $12,000 than my minimum of $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good price than to hold out and potentially get nothing."
