"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to meet in the middle, Alice. But I'm still a bit hesitant at $92.  Would you be willing to come down to $88? That would be a fair compromise, and it's still below what I'm willing to pay from John.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $95 is still above my budget.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product.",90.0,Bob,6,
