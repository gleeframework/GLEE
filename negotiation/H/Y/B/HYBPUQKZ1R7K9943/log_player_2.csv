"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and we have 10 rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making it more appealing to her while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  A 20% reduction is a substantial starting point, and if Alice rejects this, we'll adjust our counteroffer accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above our desired range. We've got rounds left, and there's no reason to settle right now. We'll counter with a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our target price.  This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and her current one, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds if needed."
