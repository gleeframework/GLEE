"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's offer:**  Being polite can encourage continued negotiation.
* **Establish a middle ground:** Starting at $10,750 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $12,000 maximum.
* **Test Alice's flexibility:**  We'll see how willing Alice is to move from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price we'd consider, she's still quite a way above her valuation. We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a price closer to your product's worth, Alice.  How about $10,900? That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 10900
}
``` 

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Alice's perspective can help keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not by a large amount. This signals we're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Highlight Your Concession:** Emphasizing our price increase aims to nudge Alice towards a final agreement."
