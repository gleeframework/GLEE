"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
