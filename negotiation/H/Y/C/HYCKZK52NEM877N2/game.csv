"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This takes into account the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $900,000. I need to see some movement from your side to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, but I need you to understand this product's significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a considerable compromise. However, I need to see some serious movement on your end in the next round to justify continuing these negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but I also have budget constraints.  My absolute maximum is $1,000,000.  Take it or leave it.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
