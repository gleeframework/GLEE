"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $180, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value (""fantastic product"", ""you'd really love it"") can make Bob more interested.

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and keep the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's initial offer is at my minimum, but I'd prefer to earn more if possible. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Signal My Value:**  Show Bob that I believe the product is worth more than $120, encouraging him to potentially offer a higher price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By continuing the negotiation, I retain the option of selling to John if Bob's final offer remains too low. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $150? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $180 to $150, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value Focus:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" aspect, reminding Bob of the value he'll receive.
* **Fair Profit:**  I subtly emphasize my need to make a ""fair profit,"" hinting at the value of the product and my desire to maintain a reasonable margin. 

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob feels like he's getting a good deal, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still at $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $135 is a reasonable compromise and brings us closer to an agreement.  
* **Time Constraints:** We're already in round 4, and with 10 rounds total, I don't want to risk dragging the negotiation out too long. 
* **Selling to John:** While $135 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly higher than the $120 I'd get from John. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale and a decent profit without the risk of further delays or a potential lower price."
