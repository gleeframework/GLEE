"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $600,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is even higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $710,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to acquire a valuable asset within my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement this round.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $720,000. I believe this is the minimum price I need to get to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $710,000 and $720,000, so I'm making a counteroffer of $715,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
