# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.
