,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",108.0,Bob,4,
