Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product name] that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting point above your minimum value of $100. It allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **""Hi Bob..."" :** This is a friendly and engaging opening to start the negotiation. 
* **""... I think you might be interested in..."" :**  This subtly implies the product has value to Bob without explicitly stating it.

By starting high and using a friendly tone, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept Bob's offer immediately. He clearly recognizes the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Explore further negotiation:**  You can make a counteroffer closer to your initial price. 
* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  By seeing how far he's willing to go, you can determine if he truly values the product. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, you demonstrate that you are not desperate to sell at the lowest price.

This strategy positions you for potentially earning a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also shows my willingness to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lower price but still profitable:**  Offering $125 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while remaining above your minimum.
* **Emphasize value and willingness to compromise:**  The message highlights both the product's value and your willingness to work with Bob. 
* **Open-ended question:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This approach maintains your position while offering a more attractive price to Bob, encouraging him to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible for you to reduce the price to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $125 asking price, Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum of $100 and a significant improvement from his initial $100 offer.  

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Profit:** $110 is a good profit margin for me.
* **Time efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and potentially lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate.
* **Risk mitigation:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me the minimum, but I'm taking a chance that John might have another buyer or change his mind.  

Accepting Bob's offer secures a fair price and avoids further negotiation risks."
