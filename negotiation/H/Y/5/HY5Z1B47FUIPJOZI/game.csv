"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  However,  $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer on the high side, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I understand this is your final offer on the high side, so how about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
