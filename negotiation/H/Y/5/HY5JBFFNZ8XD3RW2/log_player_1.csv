Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong initial offer is key. Offering the product at $130 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($150)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. I would like to propose $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $100 is above your minimum, it's still considerably lower than your initial offer and closer to the lower end of the potential profit margin. Bob rejecting your first offer suggests he might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** By suggesting $115, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. This tactic often sits well with buyers.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  $115 is still a significant profit margin for you ($35 above your minimum) and a reasonable price for Bob considering its value to him. 
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  By making a counteroffer, we keep the negotiation active and prevent Bob from potentially walking away."
