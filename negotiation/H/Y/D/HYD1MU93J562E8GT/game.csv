Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above your initial offer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is this something you'd be comfortable with?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9200. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
