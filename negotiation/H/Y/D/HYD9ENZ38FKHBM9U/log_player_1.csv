Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob will find the value to be worth it, but I'm also open to a counteroffer if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'd like to get, but it's still above my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. I'm hoping that this will be an agreeable price for both of us."
