"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get it to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
