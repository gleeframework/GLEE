"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and quality, I am proposing a price of $9,500 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and includes all the features and benefits you're looking for. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited.

I look forward to your consideration of this offer.
