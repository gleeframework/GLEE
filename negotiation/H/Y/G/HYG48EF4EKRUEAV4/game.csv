"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you valuing the product at $12,000. However,  $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
