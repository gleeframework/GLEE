"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13000 right now. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13800. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $13800 is closer, it's still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $13000.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
