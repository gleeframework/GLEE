"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. How about we bring it down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and so am I. To be honest, $13,500 is a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle at $12,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we try $13,000? It's a small increase, but it's still a compromise from my original price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm also eager to reach an agreement, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $12,250? I think that's a fair offer considering where we've been in the negotiation.",12250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower than $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Alice,9,
