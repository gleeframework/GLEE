"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to acquire this item. We are willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, we're proposing a new price of $13,000 for the product. This allows us to cover our costs while also being competitive in the market. Please let us know if this is acceptable.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your proposal of $12,500. We've carefully considered your offer and are willing to meet you halfway at $12,750.
