Thanks for the offer Alice!  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think.,85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $87.50? That's a good compromise and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
