Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before anyone else. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Our goal is to maximize profit but also secure a deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product slightly below John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much negotiation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and having the safety net of John's offer."
