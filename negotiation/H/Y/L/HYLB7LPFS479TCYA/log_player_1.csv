Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves some profit for Bob ($500) while still securing a significant profit for you ($1,500).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net.  You're not desperate, so you can aim higher with Bob.
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" Approach:** This creates a sense of urgency and limits the potential for drawn-out negotiations."
