"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to benefit greatly."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief that it's a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This initial offer gives me flexibility to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message indicates budget constraints, but his initial valuation was $1,200,000. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable price.  Selling to John is a last resort at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $1,100,000 is a more accurate reflection of its worth. This price ensures a win-win scenario for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down slightly from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price significantly above Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value proposition, justifying the higher price point.
* **Pressure Point:** I'm getting closer to my fallback option ($1,000,000 from John) but believe Bob is still willing to pay more. This counteroffer aims to test that belief."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,075,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant profit over my minimum ($1,000,000) and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating genuine interest and willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a strong profit without further delay."
