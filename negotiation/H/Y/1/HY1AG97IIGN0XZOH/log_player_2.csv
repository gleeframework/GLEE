Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $7,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller profit margin. I'm offering it to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm and her final offer of $7,200 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for Bob at this point."
