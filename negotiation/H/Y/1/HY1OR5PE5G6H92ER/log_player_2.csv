"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,250 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum price of $12,000.  Accepting Alice's offer would allow Bob to purchase the product at a lower price than John, while still staying within his budget.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially increasing the price is not worth it in this case."
