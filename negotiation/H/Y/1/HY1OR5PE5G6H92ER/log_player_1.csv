"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
