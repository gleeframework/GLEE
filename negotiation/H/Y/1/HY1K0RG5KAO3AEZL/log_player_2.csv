Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $97.5, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and at $110, it's still above your maximum budget. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, ensuring you stay within your budget."
