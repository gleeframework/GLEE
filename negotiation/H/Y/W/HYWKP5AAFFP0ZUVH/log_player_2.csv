You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to a fair deal, so my final offer is $14,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a great deal for a product you won't find elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

``` 

Reason: While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget. I can get the product for a guaranteed $12,000 from John, which is a better deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not going any lower."
