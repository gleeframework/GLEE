Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is intentionally high to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, we know he's serious about getting a lower price. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low.  It's clear he's aiming for a price far below what we know the product is worth. We need to signal that we're serious about a price closer to our valuation. We'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer that's still above Bob's perceived value but below our initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Bob's Value:**  We've significantly reduced the price from $20,000 to $17,000 to show flexibility. However, it's still above Bob's stated value of $12,000, leaving room for further negotiation while staying above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the price.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us understand how serious Bob is and how much he might be willing to go up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $10,000 is still significantly below our minimum of $15,000. It seems unlikely he'll reach a price we find acceptable. At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of missing out on a guaranteed sale to John. We need to push for a more serious offer from Bob or take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to a fair deal, so my final offer is $14,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a great deal for a product you won't find elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're making it clear that this is our best offer and we're not willing to go lower. 
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the value of the product and its uniqueness to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $14,000, we're still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 while leaving ourselves a small buffer from John's offer of $15,000. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** We're ready to walk away if Bob rejects this offer and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
