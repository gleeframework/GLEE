"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product holds significantly more value for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I respect your approach to this negotiation, so I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about $1,175,000? I think this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,175,000 is still slightly too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, but it's the highest I can realistically go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
