"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I respect your approach to this negotiation, so I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about $1,175,000? I think this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,175,000 is still slightly too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, but it's the highest I can realistically go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,150,000 is a significant profit and a good outcome for both of us."
