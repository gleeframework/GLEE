"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you want to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $11,000 price tag. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This price reflects the product's value while also being a fair compromise. It's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I've found a better deal with another seller, and I'm going to go with that. Good luck with the sale of the product!",10000.0,Bob,6,
