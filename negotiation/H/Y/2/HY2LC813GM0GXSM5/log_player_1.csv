Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it's a valuable asset that can benefit your business greatly. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will prove to be a wise investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's potential benefits for Bob's business to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for counteroffers, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation process. 
* **Plan B:** I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Although Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer at a higher price, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe there's a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's below the value I need to secure for this product.  Considering the potential benefits for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a strong investment for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while still holding firm on my need to get a higher price.
* **Fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits to encourage him to consider the value proposition.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion and potential agreement."
