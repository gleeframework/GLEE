"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's a range where both of us can benefit. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11200. This is a good compromise, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is closer to my ideal price of $10,500, and it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to go with John's price isn't worth it. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
