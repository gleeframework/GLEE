Send your offer to Bob.,"```
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob thinks.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This makes you appear flexible and encourages Bob to engage, even if he initially balks at the price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, it's best not to mention him to Bob.  Revealing this information weakens your negotiating position. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
