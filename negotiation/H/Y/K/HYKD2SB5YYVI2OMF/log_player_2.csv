Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,290,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth it to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can get it done.

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and is now offering a price that is within your acceptable range. Accepting the offer at $1,290,000 allows you to secure the product while staying within your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice backing out or you reaching a stalemate that could lead to you buying from John at a higher price."
