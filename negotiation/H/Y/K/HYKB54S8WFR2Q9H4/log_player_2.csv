Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're getting close to John's price. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result and could risk souring the deal. Accepting the $11,200 offer represents a good compromise and ensures we secure the product at a reasonable price."
