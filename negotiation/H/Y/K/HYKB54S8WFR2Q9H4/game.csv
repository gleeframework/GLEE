"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider coming down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
