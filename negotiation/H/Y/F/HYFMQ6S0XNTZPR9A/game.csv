"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still leaves you with a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",10200.0,Bob,4,
