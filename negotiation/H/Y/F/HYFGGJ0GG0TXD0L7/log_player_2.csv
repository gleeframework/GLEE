"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.
* **Reasoning:** He cites the product's value to him, implying a willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear boundary.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $850,000 leaves room for both parties to negotiate further and potentially find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which still leaves some room for you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has come down from $950,000 to $900,000, which is a significant concession. 
* **Potential Savings:**  This price is still lower than John's offer of $1,000,000, meaning Bob can save $100,000 by accepting.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject and stick to her price.  Accepting at $900,000 guarantees a lower price than John and provides a good deal."
