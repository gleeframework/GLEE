Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get at least $800,000, your floor price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $50,000 buffer between your offer and Bob's perceived value. This allows for some give-and-take during the negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not starting at your minimum, which implies you believe the product is worth more. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, there's still room to improve the price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue the negotiation and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which still leaves some room for you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
