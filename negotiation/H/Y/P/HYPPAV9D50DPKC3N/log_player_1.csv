Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 

My reasoning:

* **High initial offer:**  It's a common strategy to start high to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  If Bob is truly interested, I might be able to secure a price closer to my ideal.
* **Worst-case scenario:** Even if Bob rejects, I still have John lined up to buy the product for $800,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
