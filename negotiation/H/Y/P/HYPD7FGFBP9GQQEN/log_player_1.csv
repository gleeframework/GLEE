Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** My message highlights the potential value Bob could gain from the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being too aggressive and am inviting Bob to discuss the price. This helps keep the negotiation open. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I could potentially sell to John for that amount. This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000 and even significantly less than his perceived value of $8,000.  It's not a serious offer and accepting it would be a huge loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but is also lower than my initial offer of $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and open tone, emphasizing a desire to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

By offering $9,000, I'm testing the waters to see how far Bob is willing to go. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his true ceiling price. I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I want to explore all options with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is closer to my minimum price than his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price.  If he rejects my final counteroffer, I will sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $7,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last offer, increasing the pressure for him to accept.
* **Slightly Lower:**  I've lowered my price from $9,000 to $10,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a firm stance.
* **Threat of Departure:**  I've subtly threatened to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept this offer. This creates a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will convince Bob to accept. If he rejects it, I will move on to John and secure the $15,000 sale."
