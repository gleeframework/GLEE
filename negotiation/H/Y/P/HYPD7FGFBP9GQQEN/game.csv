"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find some common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $7,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
