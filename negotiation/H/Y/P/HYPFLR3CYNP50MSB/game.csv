"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too far below what I'm hoping for. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This would allow us both to come to an agreement that is fair and beneficial. Let's make this deal happen!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,300,000. Can we agree on that price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
