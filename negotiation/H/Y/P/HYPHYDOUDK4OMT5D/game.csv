"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise given the product's value and my need to get a decent price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I respect that. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000 to try and close this deal. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to move closer.  However, $775,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $825,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value and the significant compromises I've made. This is my final offer.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
