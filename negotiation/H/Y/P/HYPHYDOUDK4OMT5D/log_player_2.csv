Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? "", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise given the product's value and my need to get a decent price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to move closer.  However, $775,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $825,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value and the significant compromises I've made. This is my final offer.  I hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her ""final offer"" of $825,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. There's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk her sticking to this price. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you stay within budget."
