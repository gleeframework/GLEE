"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do any better on the price?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider my minimum price, and $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you want. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $9,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,375?",9375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,375 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
