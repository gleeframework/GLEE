"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth and the benefits it can bring. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is a good starting point,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $13500?  This gives us both some room to negotiate and ensures a fair price for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $13000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $13250? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my last offer.  How about $12000? That's a significant drop from my initial asking price, and it would still make this deal worthwhile for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,7,
