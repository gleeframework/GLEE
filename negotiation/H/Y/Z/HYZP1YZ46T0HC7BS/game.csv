"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $7,000? That's the highest I can go.",7000.0,Bob,4,
