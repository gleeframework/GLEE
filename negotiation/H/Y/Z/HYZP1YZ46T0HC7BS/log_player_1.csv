Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion and counteroffers.
* **Plan B:**  While I'm trying to secure a deal with Bob, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While I could sell to John right now, I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to reconsider my offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""meeting in the middle,"" which can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects my counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $7,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still not enough.
* **Time is money:**  While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried about wasting time and potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out process.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and ensures I don't lose out on a potential profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer from Bob, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth it, considering my guaranteed $15,000 from John."
