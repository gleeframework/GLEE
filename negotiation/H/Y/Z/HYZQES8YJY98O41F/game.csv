"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $19,000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $19,000 is still quite a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate that.  However, $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500. If you're open to it, I think we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $14,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for the value you're getting.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? I believe this is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
