Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $136.25 and $142.50, which is $139.375. Let me round that to $139. How about we call it a deal at $139?

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than this. Accepting at $139 gets you the product for under your $150 budget."
