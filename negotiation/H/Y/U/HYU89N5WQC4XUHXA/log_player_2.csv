Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a figure that reflects the true value of what's being offered. Would you be willing to consider $1,975,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.
