"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a figure that reflects the true value of what's being offered. Would you be willing to consider $1,975,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
