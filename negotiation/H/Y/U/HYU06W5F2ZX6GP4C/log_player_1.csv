"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($80), but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to the $150 value Bob sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good offer and above my minimum price, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I believe I can get a bit closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. There are still rounds left and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. This is a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is holding firm at $85, and while that's above my minimum, it's still below my target price. However, we are now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left to negotiate. The risk of continuing is that Bob might become more stubborn or even walk away.  

It's important to weigh my options:

* **Accept Bob's offer:**  This would secure a sale, but it's only $5 above my minimum, which isn't ideal.
* **Continue Negotiating:** This carries the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, pushing the price further down, or even walking away.
* **Sell to John:**  This guarantees me my minimum price of $80.

Considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of losing the deal entirely, it's the most sensible choice to **sell to John** and secure the $80. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
