,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, I can't go as low as $1500000. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1600000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference - $1650000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000, but I need to be closer to my target. Can you meet me at $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1550000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1580000, but I need to be closer to my target. Can you consider this offer?",1580000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm going to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1590000 for the product. This is my best offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation history. Let's make this happen.",1590000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to go above $1500000. I've done my research, and I believe that's the maximum value of the product. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,10,
