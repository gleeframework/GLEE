"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, we signal that we're looking for a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $110 is still a reasonable profit for Alice (given her valuation of $120).
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  A counter-offer between our last offer and her current one might land us a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Targeting Her Valuation:** We know Alice values the product at $120, so this offer is likely to be tempting for her. 
* **Still Below Budget:**  This offer keeps us comfortably below our maximum budget."
