"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings while still acquiring the product. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $15,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This means there's potential for a better price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A significant counteroffer (30% lower) shows Bob is serious about negotiation and aims for a considerable discount.
* **Leaving Room:**  $12,000 still gives room for Alice to counter without losing too much profit.
* **Testing Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved from $15,000 to $13,500, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant Savings:**  Accepting saves Bob $1,500 compared to his initial budget. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 10 rounds, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to pay John $15,000. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point, balancing savings with the risk of further negotiation."
