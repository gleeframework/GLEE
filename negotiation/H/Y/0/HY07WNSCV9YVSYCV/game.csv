"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a price that makes sense for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I see your commitment to this product. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. To show my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can finalize a deal in this round.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
