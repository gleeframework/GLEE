"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the full value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $950,000. I'd like to propose $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me, and it's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,4,
