"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I have to consider the value that this product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $875000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I've done my research, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is my final offer below $1000000.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
