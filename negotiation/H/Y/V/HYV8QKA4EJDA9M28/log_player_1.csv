Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob declines. 

Therefore, offering the product slightly below John's price ($119) creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. It's a price that's still profitable for you but more appealing to Bob than losing the deal."
