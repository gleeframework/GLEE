Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,500 is better than $10,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I can likely get closer to my desired amount by counter-offering Bob."
