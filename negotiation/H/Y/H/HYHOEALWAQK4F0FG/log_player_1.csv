"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to make Bob more likely to consider my offer.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that Bob values the product at $100, so there is a gap. However, I'm aiming to reach a compromise that allows me to earn as much as possible while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:**  I'm offering $160, which is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize finding a price that works for both of us, making the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By offering $160, I'm leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob is willing to compromise, we might be able to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150, it's still below it. 
* **Possibility of a better deal:**  I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get from Bob. There might be more room for negotiation, especially with John's offer as a backup.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  I'm avoiding a quick sale at $140, as I believe I can still secure a better deal, potentially closer to my minimum acceptable value or even higher.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $140, aiming to find a middle ground and push Bob closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation. While I'd love to accept $140, I need to stay a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $145, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $160 and Bob's last offer of $140. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Urgency:**  I use the phrase ""Let's make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Round Strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I will either be ready to accept his offer if he's close to $145, or I might be willing to slightly adjust my price depending on how many rounds are left. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and won't hesitate to sell to him if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $135. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $135 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I'm confident that I can still secure a better price, even with only a few rounds left. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $135, aiming to find a middle ground. I will emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $135 is just a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $140, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $145 and Bob's last offer of $135.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm framing the offer as a way to ""bridge the gap"" to encourage Bob to find common ground.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to push for a deal while staying above my minimum acceptable value.

**Next Round Strategy:**  I will carefully assess Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will consider my options:
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffer is below $140 and we have only one or two rounds remaining, I will likely sell to John to avoid losing too much money.
* **Hold Firm:**  If there are a few rounds left and Bob's counteroffer is still below $140, I might hold firm and see if he's willing to come closer to my price. However, I'll need to balance the potential of getting a better offer from Bob with the risk of running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $130 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal is high.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the time constraint and Bob's persistent low offers, I've decided to take the guaranteed sale to John. This minimizes my risk and ensures I receive my minimum desired value."
