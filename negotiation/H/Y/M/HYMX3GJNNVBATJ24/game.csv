"Alice,  $1000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
