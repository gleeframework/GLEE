"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is way above his budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, Bob is better off going with John to save $100,000.  Further negotiation with Alice risks going over Bob's budget."
