Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  It's high enough that Bob will likely counter-offer, giving us room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, meaning I'm not giving away too much.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and be prepared to negotiate. I have a backup buyer in John, who will pay my minimum price, so I have the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is not a good starting point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to get closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower my price.
* **Still above my minimum:**  I'm staying above my $1,200,000 minimum, ensuring I don't settle for less than I'm comfortable with.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price slightly, I'm aiming to make the deal more attractive to Bob while still maintaining a good position. If Bob accepts, I'll get a good price. If he rejects, I can either counteroffer again or sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already had two rounds of negotiation and haven't managed to get a price I'm satisfied with. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and guarantees the sale.  The potential for further negotiation with Bob is too risky considering John is a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with."
