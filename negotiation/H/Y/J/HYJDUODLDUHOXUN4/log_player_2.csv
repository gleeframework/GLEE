"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $15,000.** While it's a good deal compared to John's price, it's still not within your budget.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price.** You can start by making a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11000 for the product, which is still a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?

* **This is a good deal compared to John's price.** While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price. 
* **Accepting the offer saves you time and avoids further negotiation.**  You're getting a good price, and it's worth closing the deal to avoid the uncertainty of further rounds."
