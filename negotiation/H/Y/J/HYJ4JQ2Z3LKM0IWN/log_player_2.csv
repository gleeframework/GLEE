"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is only slightly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This leaves open the possibility of Alice making a counter-offer closer to her perceived value of $800,000. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can still buy from John at your maximum budget.

**Strategy:** Aim to negotiate a price closer to $800,000 with Alice. If unsuccessful, you still have the safety net of buying from John."
