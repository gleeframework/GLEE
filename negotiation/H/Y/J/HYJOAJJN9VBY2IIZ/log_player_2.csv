"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You should reject the offer.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  $12,000 is a good start, but you have room to save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's below your maximum price of $15,000 and you've already saved $3,500. There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away or you having to pay John's full price outweighs the potential for further savings."
