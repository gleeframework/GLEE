Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for it. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and be willing to pay a premium. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Alice further, she's moved closer to our desired price point. Accepting at $1,250,000 saves us $250,000 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing altogether."
