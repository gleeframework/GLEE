"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product.  However, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to pay $125 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, given the exceptional quality and unique features of our product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I am proposing a revised price of $135 for the product. This still reflects the value we place on it, while remaining open to your considerations. I look forward to your thoughts on this offer.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $130. This is a good price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
