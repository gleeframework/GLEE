"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, starting at $150 (Bob's maximum) risks immediate rejection. $130 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still securing a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent profit, we're still in early rounds. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial bid. Rejecting now gives us a chance to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price of $120, we're showing a willingness to negotiate and move towards Bob's offer.
* **Still Profitable:** $120 represents a significant profit margin for Alice, keeping the negotiation focused on a price point well above her minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility and determine how much further we can push the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit below the middle ground, how about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $115 is a good profit for Alice, exceeding her minimum by $15.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but his incremental increases suggest he might not go much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away. Accepting the $115 offer secures a good profit now."
