Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product at a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, ideally more than the $150 John is offering.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still being profitable for you (above your $150 minimum).
* **Attractive Offer:** While $130 is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), it's presented as a ""special price"" to make it seem more appealing.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $30 above your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum acceptable profit of $0 (since it's worth $150 to you)."
