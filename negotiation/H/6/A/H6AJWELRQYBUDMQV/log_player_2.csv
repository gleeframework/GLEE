You can do better than $110, so reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You're still aiming for a lower price than $115.  Reject the offer and see if you can get closer to your goal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer a lower price, Alice has come down to $112, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
