"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500, so how about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
