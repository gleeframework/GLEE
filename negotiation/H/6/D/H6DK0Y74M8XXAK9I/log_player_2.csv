"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to push for a lower price.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
