"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a little outside my budget.  How about $10,500?  I really do want this product, and I believe this is a fair price considering my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
