You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, though, to see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation.  While this counteroffer is probably too low, Bob wants to see how Alice responds to a bold move.  This will give him an idea of how flexible she is and how much he needs to adjust his strategy."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He's got a few more rounds, and he can try to negotiate a better price.  At this point, it's not worth buying from John yet.  It might be possible to get the product for even less from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob's counteroffer is a bit more realistic, closer to Alice's last offer but still below his maximum. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's getting closer to his budget, but there's still room to bargain.  At this point, buying from John is still a viable option, so Bob shouldn't rush into a deal just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  He's still below John's price, but closing in on his maximum. This round is crucial for gauging Alice's willingness to concede further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his maximum budget, he's still within his negotiation rounds and could potentially secure a better deal.  He's already shown his willingness to compromise, and Alice has also demonstrated her flexibility.  It's worth trying to get the price down to $1,500,000 to match John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Bob makes his final counteroffer, matching John's price. This is his best possible offer, and it's risky, but he has to be bold. He's showing Alice that he's serious about getting the best deal, but he's also prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down. It's now or never."
