Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but is also holding firm to a price above her value.  While we could likely negotiate her down a little further, the time and potential to lose the deal aren't worth the risk. Accepting at $1,012,500 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
