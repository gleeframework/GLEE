"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000, reflecting a significant discount, but still acknowledging its worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value the product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to my budget, I'm still stretched. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to your business, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1025000 is getting closer,  I'm still working within a tight budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see it as a step towards a mutually beneficial deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $975000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
