Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significant discount, for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, getting Bob to buy at a higher price earns you more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency and a significant perceived discount for Bob. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's a potential profit margin. By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining the safety net of John's offer."
