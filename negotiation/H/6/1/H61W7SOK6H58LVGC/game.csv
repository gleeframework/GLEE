"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to be clear that this is my final concession. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can both walk away happy. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
