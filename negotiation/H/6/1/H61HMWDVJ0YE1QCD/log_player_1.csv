Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before listing it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""I think it would be perfect for you!"") can make the price feel more justified, even if the reason is somewhat generic. 
* **Alternative Mention:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob could lose out to other buyers if he doesn't act.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! You get more than your minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to go down and still make a profit.  
* **Bob rejects:** You can always counter-offer, or move on to John who will pay your minimum."
