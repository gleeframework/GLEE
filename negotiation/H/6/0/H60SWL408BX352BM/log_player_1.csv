I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering it's worth $100 to him and I'm willing to sell it to John for $80 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than what I initially wanted, it's only $2 less than selling to John, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort."
