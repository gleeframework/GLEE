"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if there's some middle ground we can reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a little. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again. I'm starting to feel like we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is just a little above my minimum acceptable price, and I think it shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's a fair offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
