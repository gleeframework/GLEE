Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still above my maximum value but leaves room for compromise."

Alice's offer is still too high. I will reject the offer and continue to negotiate. I am willing to pay a little more than $10,000, but I need to stay below $12,000 to be within my budget."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum value. It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not going to accept it just yet. I'm going to try to get a lower price."

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay my maximum value for the product, but I won't go any higher. If Alice doesn't accept, I will buy from John."
