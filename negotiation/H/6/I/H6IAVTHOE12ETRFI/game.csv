"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not able to go lower than $800000. This is the lowest I can go, as the product is worth at least that much to me. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment. Let me know if you're willing to agree.",800000.0,Alice,5,
