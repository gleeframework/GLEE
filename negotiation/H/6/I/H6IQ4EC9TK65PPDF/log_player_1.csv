Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
