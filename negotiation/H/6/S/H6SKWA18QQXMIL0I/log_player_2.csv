"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. I know this is a significant investment, but it's a unique opportunity with potential for high returns.  While I value this product at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,400,000 for the product. That's above my budget of $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
