"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it can bring.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
