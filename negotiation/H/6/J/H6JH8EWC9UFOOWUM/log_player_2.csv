Considering the significant impact this product could have on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This represents a remarkable saving compared to its original valuation of $1,500,000, making it an exceptional investment for you.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a discount from her original valuation and your maximum price, you know you have another option with John for $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might:

* Prompt Alice to make a better offer, closer to her true valuation of $1,200,000.
* Give you a chance to counter-offer at a price point more favorable to you."
