Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer that gives Bob some room to negotiate while still securing a substantial profit for you. This price is well above your minimum and allows you to gauge Bob's interest without risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below your minimum price. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, it's worth trying to squeeze out more value. You can likely get closer to your target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and significantly higher than what John would pay. It's crucial to recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher offer, and potentially risks losing the deal altogether."
