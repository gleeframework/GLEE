Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum of $80, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is still more than your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer. You want to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still profitable:** $110 is still above your minimum and closer to your initial offer.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter again if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to increase my offer to $105. This is the highest I can go without compromising my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $105 is only $5 away from your initial offer of $110. 
* **Better than John's offer:**  $105 is significantly more than the $80 you'd get from John.
* **Minimizes risk:**  While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
