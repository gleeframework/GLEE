"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you've put on the product at $8,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $9,000.  This is the most I can afford at this time.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
