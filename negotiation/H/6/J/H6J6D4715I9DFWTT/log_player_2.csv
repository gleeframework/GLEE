"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You should reject and counteroffer to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you've put on the product at $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $13,500 is closer to your budget, it's still over what you're willing to pay. You should reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $9,000.  This is the most I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above your budget. It's clear that you and Alice are not going to agree on a price that works for both of you. At this point, it's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $8,000. You've saved $4,000 and have time to explore other options if needed."
