Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is a strong strategy.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to create a sense of value that might justify a price higher than Bob's initial estimate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to still secure a price well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your risk tolerance."
