"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there. However, I'm keeping the option open to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's perceived value. This shows flexibility while keeping the price close to my target. I hope this will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is a better offer than selling to John. I'll accept this offer and secure a good deal."
