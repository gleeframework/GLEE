"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest in the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
