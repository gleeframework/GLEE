You can do better than $95. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.
