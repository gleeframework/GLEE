Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially making counteroffers closer to your desired range seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you have a guaranteed buyer, securing a higher price from Bob is preferable. This initial offer keeps the negotiation open while still leaving you the option to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount and closer to your minimum, it's still worthwhile to negotiate further. You have room to come down from your initial offer and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While your proposed price is appealing, the true value of this product is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,575,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're signaling willingness to negotiate by coming down from your initial offer, but not drastically. This keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common tactic can feel like a ""fair"" compromise to both parties. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps you comfortably above your guaranteed selling price to John, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, representing a substantial profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. It's often better to secure a very good deal than to hold out for a perfect deal that might not materialize. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means you have the funds available for other investments or uses, rather than potentially dragging out the negotiation process."
