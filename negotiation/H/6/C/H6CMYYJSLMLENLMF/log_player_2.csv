"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and could really benefit you. How about we start the conversation at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the potential value in this product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. 
* **Focus on value:** The message acknowledges the potential value but emphasizes Bob's budget constraints. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends by leaving the door open for further negotiation, showing flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Even though Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, there's still a $1,000 gap. With 7 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Accepting $13,000 would be a decent deal, but Bob is aiming for the best possible price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob maintains his position as the buyer with the power to set the final price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000 though.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to go with $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise but still aims for a lower price.
* **Fairness emphasis:** Highlighting the ""fair price for both of us"" positions Bob as reasonable.
* **Progress towards a deal:** The message emphasizes getting ""closer to a deal"" to encourage Alice to accept."
