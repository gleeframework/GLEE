"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and features. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",750000.0,Alice,5,
