Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to my desired price point. I want to see if I can push her down further before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair compromise given our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't accept anything less than $11,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe that's a fair price.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to risk one more round of counteroffers to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point before I buy from John."
