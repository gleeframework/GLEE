"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Emphasis on value:** I mention the product's unique value to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open invitation:**  I invite Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price but still above my minimum acceptable value. It's worth exploring further. 

Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable compromise.
* **Gain more information:**  Observing Bob's reaction and potential counteroffers will provide valuable insights into his true valuation of the product.

**Note:** Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity. While it guarantees a profit, I can potentially achieve a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and show respect for his position.
* **Justify my counteroffer:**  I explain my reasoning for the counteroffer by mentioning my initial price and proposing a middle ground.
* **Emphasize closing the deal:**  I reiterate my willingness to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

By proposing a compromise price, I am demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1200000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value. However, with only 6 rounds left, the negotiation is getting very risky.  

* **Time constraint:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further back-and-forth with no guarantee of a higher offer.
* **John's offer:**  John is offering my minimum acceptable value with no risk involved.

Selling to John guarantees a quick and secure transaction, ensuring I receive my minimum desired profit. There's no point in risking further negotiation for a potentially small gain, especially with limited rounds remaining."
