"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still slightly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1175000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1175000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to stay within my maximum of $1000000. Would you consider $1100000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and would make the deal possible for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
