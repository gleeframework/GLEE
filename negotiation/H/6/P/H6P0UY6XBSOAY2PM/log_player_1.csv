Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** You need at least $1,000,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Potential for higher price:**  You are trying to maximize your profits, so you're aiming for a higher price than John's offer.
* **Risk and Reward:**  The higher the price, the greater the risk of Bob rejecting it. However, you are also maximizing your potential reward.

By offering $1,500,000, you are striking a balance between risk and reward. It's a significant markup over your guaranteed price, but it still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if his valuation of the product is higher than your offer."
