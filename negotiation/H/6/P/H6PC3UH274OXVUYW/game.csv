"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would be a significant gain for you and still provide me with a good value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
