# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which I think is a fair and competitive offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $950,000. It's a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a reasonable first step."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to stick with this offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $875,000. I'm thinking of $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
