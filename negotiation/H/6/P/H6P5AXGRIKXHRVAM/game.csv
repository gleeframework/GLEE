"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which I think is a fair and competitive offer.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to stick with this offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $875,000. I'm thinking of $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
