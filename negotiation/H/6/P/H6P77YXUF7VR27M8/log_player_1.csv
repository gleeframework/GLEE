Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Our offer allows for a potential profit of $150,000 for Bob if he leverages the product effectively, making it an attractive proposition. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a backup."
