"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $155 is still a little out of my price range.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
