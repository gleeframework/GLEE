"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
