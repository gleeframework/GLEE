"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $125 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $128. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. I'm really interested in the product but $128 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you consider $122? That's closer to my budget, and I'd be happy to buy the product.",122.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,
