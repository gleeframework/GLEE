"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still providing you with a significant value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we try $1,350,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price,  $1,350,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,400,000. This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price that gives you a great deal while allowing me to meet my needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, which would be $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer, we've reached a point where we are unlikely to come to a mutually agreeable price. John is offering me a much higher price, which is closer to my desired value.  It's time to move on."
