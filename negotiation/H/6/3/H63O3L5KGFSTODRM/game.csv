"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still providing you with a significant value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we try $1,350,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,400,000. This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price that gives you a great deal while allowing me to meet my needs. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, which would be $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
