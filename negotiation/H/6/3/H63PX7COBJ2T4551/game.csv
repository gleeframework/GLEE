"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is closer to what I was initially looking for, but still a good compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  My final offer is $11,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,
