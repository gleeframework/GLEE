You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Since your goal is to buy the product and save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is the same as John's, you should accept Alice's offer. There's no financial advantage to rejecting and buying from John."
