"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
