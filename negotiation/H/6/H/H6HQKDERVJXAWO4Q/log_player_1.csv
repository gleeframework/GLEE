"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a lot of money, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I have 9 more rounds and I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. I've already rejected his previous offer and I'm worried that he might walk away if I push for more.  $1,050,000 is a good deal considering the value of the product to me and the risk of going through more rounds and potentially losing him as a buyer."
