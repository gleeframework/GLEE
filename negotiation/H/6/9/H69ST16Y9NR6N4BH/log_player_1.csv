Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $1,500,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though the exact value proposition isn't stated in the prompt.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide if you want to accept a lower price or move on to John."
