Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my maximum budget."

While Alice has come down some, the price is still above my budget. It's better to go with John and get the product for $8,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down any further and I don't want to risk wasting more time on this negotiation."
