Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $115.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to the price I was hoping for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $105.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 and avoid further negotiation."
