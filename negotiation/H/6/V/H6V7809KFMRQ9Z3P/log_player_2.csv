"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to break down the decision:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still more than your maximum budget and what John offers. 

**Therefore, the best decision is:** 

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You'll save $200,000 by going with John."
