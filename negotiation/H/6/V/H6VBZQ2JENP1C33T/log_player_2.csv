"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $10,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a significant markup from her valuation of $8,000. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage the option of buying from John for $10,000. This puts pressure on Alice to potentially lower her price further.  You haven't lost the opportunity to buy from her yet, but you've signaled you're willing to walk away for a better deal."
