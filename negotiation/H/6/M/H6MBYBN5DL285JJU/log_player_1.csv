"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum desired value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business to justify the price.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** 

I'm aware that Bob is only willing to pay $800,000. However, this initial offer allows me to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process.
* **John's offer as leverage:** Having John's offer of $1,000,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value, but I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still represents a good deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.  
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the significant discount I'm offering.
* **Seeking middle ground:**  I'm suggesting finding a middle ground, implying a willingness to continue negotiating.

**Key Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a benchmark. If Bob doesn't come up to a reasonable price, I'll be ready to move on.
* **Bob's financial situation:** Based on Bob's previous offer, I suspect he might be willing to go up slightly more. However, I'll need to assess his response to gauge how much more I can realistically push for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I have John's offer as a backup, which gives me the freedom to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price. However, if the negotiations stall or Bob doesn't show a willingness to compromise, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer and move on."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's current offer ($950,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on a ""win-win"":** I'm emphasizing that this price is a win for both of us. It's a compromise that allows me to make a decent profit while still giving Bob a good deal.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a constructive tone and keep the negotiation process moving forward.

**Key Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. However, this counteroffer is close enough to my minimum desired value that I'm confident I can still achieve a good outcome.
* **Bob's commitment:**  This counteroffer will be a good indicator of how serious Bob is about getting the product. If he rejects this offer, it might be a sign that he's not willing to meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not enough:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000, but it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating.
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I reject this offer and counter with a lower price, there's a risk that Bob might continue to lowball me, or even walk away from the deal.
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit that is more aligned with my expectations. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited number of rounds and the risk of not reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John's offer provides a safe and secure option that allows me to move forward with the transaction."
