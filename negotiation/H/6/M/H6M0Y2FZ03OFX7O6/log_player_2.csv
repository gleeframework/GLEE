Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $120 to me, and I'm not going to pay more than that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out.  However, $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it, as that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
