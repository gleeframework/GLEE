"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a great deal for Bob. Alice is offering the product for $300,000 less than its value to him and what John is offering.  Bob should accept the offer."
