"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me,  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I see your point, the product's inherent value justifies a higher price. Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,175,000 still exceeds my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and it represents the very most I can pay. Let's seal the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
