Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,175,000 still exceeds my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and it represents the very most I can pay. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unwilling to reach my minimum price. Waiting any longer risks leaving money on the table. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
