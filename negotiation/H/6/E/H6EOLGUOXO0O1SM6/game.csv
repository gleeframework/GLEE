"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $98 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
