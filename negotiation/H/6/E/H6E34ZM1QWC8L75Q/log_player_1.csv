"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it allows for some negotiation room.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but won't settle for a price significantly below my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and above my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept this to avoid further negotiation and the risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price."
