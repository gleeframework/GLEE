You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since Alice's offer is your maximum price, we can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. There's no downside to rejecting the offer in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This aggressive approach might make Alice reconsider, and it gives us room to negotiate. We'll see how she responds and adjust our strategy based on her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  We can aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 in the next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still a substantial discount from her offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that leaves room for further negotiation."
