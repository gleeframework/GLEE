"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice, as her offer is quite close to our maximum budget. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet in the middle of our initial budgets. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $117? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
