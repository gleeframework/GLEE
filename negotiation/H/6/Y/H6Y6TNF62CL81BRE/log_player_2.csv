# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident you'd find incredibly useful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, its value to you is potentially higher.  Accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John at $15,000."
