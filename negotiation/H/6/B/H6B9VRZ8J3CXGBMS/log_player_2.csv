"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price. How about we settle on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He has time and a backup option with John, so there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $887,500?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range.  While he could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get more stubborn and he'll end up paying more. It's also getting closer to the price John is offering.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's within his budget and a good deal compared to his alternative."
