"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  You have a clear upper limit of $12,000, so you can see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,000 is tempting, but I'd really like to see if we can get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $11,000 to $10,800. This is a good price for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John."
