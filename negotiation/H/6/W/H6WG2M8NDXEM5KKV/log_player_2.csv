# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and our current market conditions, we are willing to negotiate at a price of $1,300,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value, while also allowing us to cover our costs and ensure a fair profit. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and is closer to your ideal price of $1,250,000 than John's offer. It's a good deal and worth accepting."
