"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors. The value this product holds for you is estimated at $1,000,000, and I am excited to extend you an offer that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.

I propose to sell the product to you at a price of $900,000. This offer not only provides you with an exceptional value for your investment but also allows me to maintain a competitive edge in the market by securing a profit that aligns with my business objectives.

Please consider this proposal carefully. Should you find it satisfactory, I am more than ready to proceed with the transaction. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Looking forward to your positive response,

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a good deal. You're getting the product for $100,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly less than its value to Alice.  There's no reason to pay John more for the same product."
