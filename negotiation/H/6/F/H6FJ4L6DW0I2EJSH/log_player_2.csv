"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so there's no immediate gain in accepting.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price. If she doesn't, you can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500 to make this work.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and a reasonable compromise from his initial counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
