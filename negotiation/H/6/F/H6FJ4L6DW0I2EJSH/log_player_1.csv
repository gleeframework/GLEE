{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **High Initial Offer:** By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message is friendly and highlights the product's value, building a rapport with Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $15,000 gives me space to lower the price if needed, while still ensuring a good profit.

Remember,  the negotiation is dynamic.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and any counteroffers he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $12000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering what I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price but still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of maximizing my earnings while still remaining open to negotiation.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price by $1,500, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Strategic Price:**  $13,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
