**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving the price lower, but he's still offering significantly more than your fallback option with John. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can secure a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $860,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $810,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, but his offers are getting very close to your fallback option with John. Accepting at $810,000 secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away if you push further."
