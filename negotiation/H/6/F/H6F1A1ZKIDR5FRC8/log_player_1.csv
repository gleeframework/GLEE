"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price ($12,000) to maximize my potential profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has a good incentive to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This allows room for compromise and avoids immediately needing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to settle for $9,500, especially since I have 8 rounds left and the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit margin.  The $10,500 price is also a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, making it a potentially attractive compromise for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $9,750. This is a small compromise that shows I'm taking Bob's counteroffers seriously.  However, it's still a significant profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm also mindful of the fact that I have fewer rounds left (5) and need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer from Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to get closer to my initial goal, the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer or needing to sell to John for a lower price is increasing.  With only four rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the most logical decision to maximize my profit."
