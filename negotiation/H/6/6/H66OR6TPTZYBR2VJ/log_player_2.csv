Alice's offer:

While I'd love to accommodate your budget, we need to maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. This price still allows us to cover our costs and ensure the quality of our product, while being more flexible than the original offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. After considering your proposal, I think a fair compromise would be to set the product price at $10,000. This still ensures a reasonable profit margin for us while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this works for you, and look forward to your acceptance.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,000. Accepting this offer secures a $2,000 savings compared to John's price."
