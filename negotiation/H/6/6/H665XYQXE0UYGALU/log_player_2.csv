"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $8750. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's ideal price.**  While Bob initially aimed for $8,500,  $8,750 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering he can always buy from John for $10,000.
* **There's a risk in rejecting again.**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might counter with an even higher price or become unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Accepting saves time and effort.** It's beneficial to secure the product at a good price rather than risk losing a potential deal by continuing to bargain."
