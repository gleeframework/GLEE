Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the asking price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice creates a sense of scarcity and urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice starts at $150, she leaves the offer open-ended, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product at a price potentially attractive to him."
