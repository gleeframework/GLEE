"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Signaling willingness to negotiate makes the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer is too far off. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain my desired price point and potentially reach a more agreeable compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm  rejecting Bob's offer, but not completely shutting the door. 
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant move from my initial price, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Fair Value:**  $160 is still above my minimum, allowing me to secure a profitable sale. 
* **Motivating Language:**  Using phrases like ""good deal for both of us"" encourages Bob to see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a risk of not reaching a satisfactory price and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
