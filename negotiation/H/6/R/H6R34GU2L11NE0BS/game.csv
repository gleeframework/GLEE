"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this level.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement at this level.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. With only a few rounds left, I'm going to have to be firm. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can finalize this agreement quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
