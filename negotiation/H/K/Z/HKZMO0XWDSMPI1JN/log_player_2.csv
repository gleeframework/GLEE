Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will come down to $8,000.  It's better to secure the known price with John than to continue haggling and risk losing the deal entirely."
