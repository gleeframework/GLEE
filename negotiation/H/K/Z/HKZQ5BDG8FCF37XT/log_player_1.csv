Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that suits us both."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate down. Starting at $15,000 leaves space for a potential compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and offering it ""exclusively"" before a public listing might make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal, even if the price is above his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Showing willingness to negotiate signals flexibility and might encourage Bob to counter-offer, increasing the chances of a sale above your minimum."
