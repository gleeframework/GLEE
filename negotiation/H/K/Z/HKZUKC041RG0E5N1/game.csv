"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $80 for it, as that's my budget. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
