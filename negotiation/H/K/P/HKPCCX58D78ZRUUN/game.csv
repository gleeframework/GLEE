"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think is fair for both of us. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! This product looks promising, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business while working within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, considering the value the product brings to your business.
