**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is incrementally moving towards my price.  While his offers are getting lower, I'm still well above my minimum.  I'll push him a bit further."

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  While I could push for more, accepting his offer at $11,500 is still a significant profit above my $10,000 minimum. It's better to take the sure deal now than risk him walking away in the later rounds."
