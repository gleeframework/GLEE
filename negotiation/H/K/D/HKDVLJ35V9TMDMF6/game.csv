"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,350,000 represents a fair reflection of this product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still slightly more than I can afford.  I'm firm on $1,150,000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've tried to be flexible.  To settle this, I'd be willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
