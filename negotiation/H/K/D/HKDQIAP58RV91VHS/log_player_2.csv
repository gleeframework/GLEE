```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is not willing to come down to my target price, and we are already halfway through the negotiations.  I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  Even though I'm not getting the best price, it's still a good deal for me."
