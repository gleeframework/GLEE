"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here. $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer in this range.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
