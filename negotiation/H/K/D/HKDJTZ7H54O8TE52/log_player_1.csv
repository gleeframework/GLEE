"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create space for both of us to compromise.  

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings while keeping the possibility of selling to John open if the negotiation with Bob fails. Starting high allows me to explore a wider range of potential outcomes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always a guaranteed outcome, but I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer.  I have a strong backup option with John, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $18,000 to $16,000. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $16,000 is a good deal compared to its worth to him.
* **Setting a Clear Limit:**  By stating $16,000 as my counteroffer, I'm setting a clear boundary and making it easier for Bob to understand my position.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's initial offer. It provides Bob with a reasonable price point while still allowing me to achieve a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $14,000 just yet.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, I'm still hopeful I can secure a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking another calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer. I'm aware that I could walk away with $15,000 from John, but I'm determined to explore if I can get even closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing further flexibility by lowering my price from $16,000 to $15,500. This indicates a sincere desire to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that $15,500 is a fair compromise, emphasizing the benefits for both of us.
* **Final Offer?:**  By stating it's a ""fair compromise"", I'm subtly hinting that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to consider accepting.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to offer a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price while also signaling a potential final offer to incentivize Bob to accept. This increases the chances of a successful deal while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13750. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** While Bob's offer of $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my target.
* **Risk of Losing Time:**  We're already at round 6, and the negotiation is getting increasingly time-consuming. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profitable outcome and eliminates further negotiation with Bob, who is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.

**Strategy:**

Given the time constraint and the risk of Bob's final offer being a tactic to lower the price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. It's a safe bet that guarantees me a good profit without further negotiation."
