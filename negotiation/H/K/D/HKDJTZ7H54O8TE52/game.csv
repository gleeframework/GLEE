"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $14000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $15500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13750. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",13750.0,Bob,6,
