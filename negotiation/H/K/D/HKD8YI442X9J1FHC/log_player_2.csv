"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: You can get a better deal than $9,500, and you're not in a rush to buy right away.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Reasoning:  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum selling price. It shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice is willing to negotiate.  You're still above your target price of $8,000, and there's still room for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

Reasoning: This counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous one, showing Bob is getting closer to his target price while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
