"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a significant markup from my minimum value of $80. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that doesn't cover my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $100, but still higher than Bob's offer of $70. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us are comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still a bit below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm accepting this offer because:

1. **It's a decent profit**: $75 is better than selling to John for $80.
2. **Time is a factor**: It's round 4, and I don't want to risk losing more time with further negotiation. 
3. **Potential for future sales**: Even though this deal isn't ideal, I'm building a relationship with Bob. He might be a repeat customer in the future."
