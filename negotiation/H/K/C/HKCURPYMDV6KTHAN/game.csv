"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept, I'll have to look at other options.",107.5,Bob,4,
