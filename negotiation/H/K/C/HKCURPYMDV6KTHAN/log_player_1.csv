{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $115 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the product's value, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, which keeps the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** While $105 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John's Offer:** The option to sell to John for $120 provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $110 is a compromise, showing Alice is willing to negotiate but still protecting her minimum profit margin.
* **Maintaining Value:** $110 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $100, making it worth his while to consider.
* **Positive Language:** The message remains positive and emphasizes fairness, promoting a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:**  $107.50 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Bob's Finality:**  Bob's statement that $107.50 is his final offer suggests there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** Alice can secure a better deal by selling to John for $120, guaranteeing a profit and minimizing the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
