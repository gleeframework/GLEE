"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair starting point.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $13,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise given your position.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value this product offers.  Let's try $12,000.  This is a final offer from my side. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",12000.0,Alice,5,
