"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for me and allows you to get a good return on your investment.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
