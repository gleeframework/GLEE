"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,000,000 and Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for me and allows you to get a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price point, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob can try to push for a lower price, knowing Alice is motivated to sell and that he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is just $50,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's a good deal for Bob as it's well below his maximum budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lower the price further, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
