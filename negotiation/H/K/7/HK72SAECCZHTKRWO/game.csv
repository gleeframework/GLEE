"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Could you do $75? That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $90. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a tough spot for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $85. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,7,
