"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the immense potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still close to my maximum limit. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm not sure it's worth $950,000 to me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and the potential I see in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer that's still within my budget.  I'm hoping to get Alice to come down a bit from her initial price.  This offer shows that I'm interested, but I'm not desperate to buy at her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me given the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which reflects the potential we both see in this opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is within my budget and closer to my initial counteroffer.  While I might be able to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and me having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product for me at a good price."
