"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,3,
