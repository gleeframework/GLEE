"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This offer is exclusive and tailored to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, and a fallback option of buying from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. After evaluating the situation, I believe we can find a middle ground. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $11,500 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still do better.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push Alice down further.  It's worth trying to get closer to his ideal price of $10,000 before considering the fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. This price aims to balance the value of the product with your financial considerations, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, he has already rejected Alice's offer twice.  It's becoming risky to push too hard, as Alice might decide to stick with her offer.  Accepting at $11,000 saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
