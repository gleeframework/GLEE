"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11250. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $10000, which is a fair price for the product.  I'm confident that this offer is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
