"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less than that.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to invest less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant investment for me.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
