``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), it's significantly lower than what John is asking ($1,500,000). 
* **Saving money is the goal.** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $400,000 compared to buying from John."
