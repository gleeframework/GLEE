"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really benefit from it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,200,000) and leaves room for negotiation. There's a potential to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being reasonable for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is within my budget of $1,200,000 and represents a good deal, considering the product's value to me.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer or me needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential gains.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
