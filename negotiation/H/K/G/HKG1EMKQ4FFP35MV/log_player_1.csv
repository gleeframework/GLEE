"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit. I'm hoping to maximize my earnings, but I'm also aware of the time constraint and the possibility of selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 yet, especially since I have several rounds left to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm countering with a price of $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating that I value the product at a higher price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still pushing for a higher price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway. It's getting down to the wire, but I'm still holding out for a good deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of negotiations, and Bob's offer is getting lower.  While I'm still hoping for a better price, I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000. This guarantees me a profit and minimizes my risk."
