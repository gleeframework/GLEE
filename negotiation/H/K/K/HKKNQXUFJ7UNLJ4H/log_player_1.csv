Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a little closer to my minimum price.  I believe I can get a better price if I counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my financial planning, I am able to offer $960000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my target of $1,000,000,  $960,000 is a reasonable offer from Bob, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, he might walk away, leaving me to sell to John at a lower price."
