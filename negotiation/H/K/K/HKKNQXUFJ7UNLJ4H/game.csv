"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $1 million. How about we split the difference and settle at $975000? Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my financial planning, I am able to offer $960000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",960000.0,Bob,4,
