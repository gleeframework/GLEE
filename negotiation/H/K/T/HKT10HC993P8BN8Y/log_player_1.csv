**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $975,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by:

* **Time Cost:**  Every round spent on Bob is a round not spent finding other potential buyers.
* **Opportunity Cost:** John represents a guaranteed $1,200,000. Accepting anything less with Bob carries risk. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The negotiation is yielding smaller and smaller concessions from Bob.

It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
