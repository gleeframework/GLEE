"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates an impression of the product's high value.
* **Justification:** We vaguely mention ""unique qualities"" and ""potential"" to justify the high asking price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and professional, signaling our willingness to negotiate a fair deal. 

By starting high, we aim to:

1. **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value and set a high reference point for future offers.
2. **Gather Information:** Gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay based on his counteroffer.
3. **Maximize Profit:**  Leave space for concessions while still aiming for a final price significantly above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer for the product is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We started high, and it's unlikely he'll immediately meet our initial offer.  We'll counter with a price closer to his but still above our minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm motivated to find an agreement that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers? I propose a price of $1,875,000."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach signals fairness and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** We avoid providing specific reasons for the price, maintaining a focus on finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Pressure to Close:**  By suggesting a compromise, we subtly nudge Bob to consider the deal more seriously as we're moving closer to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that we can come to a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. His offer is now getting closer to a price point where we might consider accepting, but we still have leverage. We'll continue to push for a better price while remaining aware of the diminishing returns of extended negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's seal the deal â€“ I can come down slightly to $1,812,500. This reflects my willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair value for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1812500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We reduce our counteroffer by a smaller margin ($62,500) compared to the previous round, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Finality:** The language (""seal the deal,"" ""fair value"") implies that this is our final offer, adding a sense of urgency. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  We're essentially offering a price slightly above the exact midpoint between our last offer and his, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit.

At this stage, we're getting closer to a point where accepting Bob's next offer might be the most strategic move. However, this slight push might be enough to secure a slightly better deal without risking losing him to the alternative of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. My counteroffer for the product is $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,775,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, representing a substantial profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains, with the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows us to reinvest the capital sooner. 

While we could try to squeeze a little more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting this offer represents a successful negotiation and a significant return."
