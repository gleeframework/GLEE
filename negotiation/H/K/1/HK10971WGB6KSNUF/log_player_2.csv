"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is higher than both your maximum price and the product's value to her.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, we aim to establish a negotiation range that works in our favor. 
* **Above Alice's Value:** The offer of $11,000 is still a profitable amount for Alice (since it's above her $12,000 value).
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for us to negotiate upwards while still staying below our maximum budget of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $13,000 is still above her product valuation. We can try pushing for a slightly lower price before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($13,000) and our previous counteroffer ($12,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Near Alice's Value:**  While this offer is slightly above Alice's perceived value, it's unlikely she'll get a much better offer from another buyer.  
* **Safety Net:** We're still comfortably below our maximum budget, leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might not result in significant savings. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we've already negotiated a price well below her initial offer. 
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the potential of Alice becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $13,200 is a decent price, significantly lower than John's $15,000 offer, and still allows Alice to make a profit."
