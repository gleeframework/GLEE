"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than John's price of $120. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and  $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's asking price ($140) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message explains the reason for the counteroffer (budget constraints) without being confrontational. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Goal:**  Our ultimate goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's price of $120.  This initial offer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate downwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. Let me see what I can do. How about if I offer the product to you for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, which is good. However, her offer of $110 is still higher than John's price of $120. It's worth making one more counteroffer to try and close the gap before accepting a higher price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $110 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need it to be a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** We're proposing a price ($105) that is directly in the middle of Alice's current offer ($110) and our previous offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a number; we're anchoring it to the ongoing negotiation to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Time Sensitivity:** While we're still aiming for a price closer to John's $120, we also recognize that we're running out of negotiation room.  This offer balances our desire for a good deal with the risk of Alice walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, I am willing to adjust my offer. How about we settle on $107 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to $107, which is a reasonable compromise. While it's not quite as low as John's price of $120, further haggling might make Alice walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting at $107 secures the product at a price significantly lower than her initial offer."
