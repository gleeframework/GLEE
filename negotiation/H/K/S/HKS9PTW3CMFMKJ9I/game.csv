"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something that you've expressed interest in before, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know if you're interested, as I'm confident this opportunity won't last long.",12000.0,Alice,1,
