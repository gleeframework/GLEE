Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $22,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value and the existence of other potential buyers. This creates a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is high, it's not outrageously so. This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he's genuinely interested, allowing you to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You can always negotiate down or proceed with the sale to John at your guaranteed price."
