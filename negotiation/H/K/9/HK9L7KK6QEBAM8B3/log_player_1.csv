Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I could push for more, accepting $115 is a reasonable compromise. It's a profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether."
