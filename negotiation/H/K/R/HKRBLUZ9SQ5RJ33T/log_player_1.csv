"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Not Too Greedy:**  I'm not starting at an unrealistic price, as this might immediately lead to Bob rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about $9000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe we can still negotiate a better price. There are 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $8,000 right now would be settling for the minimum. While it's a guaranteed sale, I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but Firm:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's significantly above my minimum.
* **Focus on the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product for him, highlighting the potential for a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my valuation, how about $9500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **More Rounds Left:**  We are only in round 4, and there are 6 rounds remaining. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Settling:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is guaranteed, I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my previous offer of $10,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Focusing on Progress:** I'm emphasizing the progress we're making towards a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
