"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. How about we set the product price at $15000? I understand its value to you, but I am looking to stay within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $17000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice's position, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Let's aim for $16000 as the product price. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there with $16000, but I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to consider $16500, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your willingness to lower the price, I propose $16000 as the product price. This should be fair for both of us while keeping my budget intact.",16000.0,Bob,6,
