"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not even close to the value Alice places on the product ($1,200,000).  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still above your budget.  While it's closer to your target, you can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation process will likely lead to a more favorable outcome."
