"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However,  $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for a reasonable profit for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
