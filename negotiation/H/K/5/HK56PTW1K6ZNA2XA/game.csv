"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is closer to my original offer. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product!",8200.0,Alice,5,
