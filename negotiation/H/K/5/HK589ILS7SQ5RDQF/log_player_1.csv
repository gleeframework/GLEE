Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. I know Bob is interested, and this gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. However, if he rejects, I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum.  I'll try to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. It's still a little below my initial asking price, but it's closer to Bob's offer and a fair compromise. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
