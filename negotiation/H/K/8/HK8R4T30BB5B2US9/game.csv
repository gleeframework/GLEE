"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm still on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $75. My final offer is $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. It seems like we're almost there.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $80?  That's really the most I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
