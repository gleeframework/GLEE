"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $80 limit and even above Alice's own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While aiming for a price around $80, I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($60). This tactic leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Expressing Interest:** I've made it clear that I'm interested in the product but only at a price that works for me. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer invites Alice to counter back, moving the negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $90 is still above your $80 limit. It's worth seeing if she's willing to negotiate further, especially since you have plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm still on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're negotiating seriously, but not going above our $80 limit.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $75 is a strong counteroffer that lands almost directly in the middle of the current negotiating range ($60 - $90).
* **Justifying the Offer:** By mentioning your budget, you're reinforcing the idea that your offer is firm while keeping the tone amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $75. My final offer is $85.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting close with her ""final offer"" of $85, but it's still above both your target price and your fallback option of buying from John. There's a chance she might be bluffing about it being her final offer, or she might be willing to meet you halfway in the next round. You haven't reached your limit for rounds, so it's worth trying one more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. It seems like we're almost there.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $80?  That's really the most I can do."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your best and final offer. It's the absolute maximum you're willing to pay and aligns with your alternative option.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is the most you can do, you're signaling that the negotiation is reaching its end.
* **Compromise:** Offering to meet ""halfway"" emphasizes fairness and a desire to reach a deal. 

**Outcome:**

Now, the ball is in Alice's court. She can accept your offer of $80 (which is a good outcome for both of you), or she can reject it and risk you walking away to buy from John."
