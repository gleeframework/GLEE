"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1150000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer you $1050000.  I think this price is fair, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers you a great deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of the product for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1075000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1075000 still falls short of what I consider fair.  I'm willing to come down to $1090000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits us both.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
