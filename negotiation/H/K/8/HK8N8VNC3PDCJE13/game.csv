,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That feels like a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
