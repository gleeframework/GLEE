"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the product's potential will far exceed your initial outlay. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
