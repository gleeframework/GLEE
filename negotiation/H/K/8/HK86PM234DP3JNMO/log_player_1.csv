Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is a step closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I want to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe I can still get a better deal through further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm continuing the negotiation process with the goal of earning more than $1,200,000."
