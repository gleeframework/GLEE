# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. What are your thoughts?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,250,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject and start counter-offering to bring the price down."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  While $2,250,000 represents a fair value for this product considering its potential, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,625,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,250,000. How about we settle on $1,437,500?
