"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not going to give it away.  How about $16,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. That's the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $14,000 is still a little too low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,500? That's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still being reasonable for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Bob,6,
