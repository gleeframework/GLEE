"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $987,500. This price reflects a significant value for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly. Let's make it happen.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I have to be mindful of the product's true worth.  I can come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
