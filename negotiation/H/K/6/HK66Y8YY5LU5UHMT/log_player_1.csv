I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a fair starting point, given the product's value to Bob.  Let's see what his response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,650,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit and hopefully shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and  John's offer is only $1,500,000.  It's time to close the deal with Bob."
