{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, given the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets the bar high, reflecting the product's worth to you, while also being a fair starting point considering Bob's valuation. This allows for room for negotiation if needed, but also establishes a strong initial stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's still below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway. This still represents a fair value for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet at $850,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still push for a higher figure.  Rejecting this offer gives me more leverage to see if Bob is willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, but this is my final offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be willing to close the deal. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's truly satisfactory for me.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with, it's best to move forward with John, who's willing to pay the full value of the product."
