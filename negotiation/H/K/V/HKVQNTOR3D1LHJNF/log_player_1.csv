Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would result in a substantial loss. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
