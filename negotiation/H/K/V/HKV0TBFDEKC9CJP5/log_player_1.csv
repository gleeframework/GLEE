Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
