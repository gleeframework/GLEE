Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,875.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we've already negotiated a bit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering our previous negotiations, I would like to propose an offer of $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $8,800 is a fair deal considering the value of the product and the fact that we've already negotiated for a while. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
