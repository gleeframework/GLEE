,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $15000? This would allow me to reach my minimum while still giving you a good price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  Could we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try $14000. It's a compromise that gets us both closer to where we need to be.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really eager to get this product, but $14000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
