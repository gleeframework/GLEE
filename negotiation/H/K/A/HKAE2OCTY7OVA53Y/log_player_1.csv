Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $15,000? This would allow me to reach my minimum while still giving you a good price."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  Could we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try $14,000. It's a compromise that gets us both closer to where we need to be.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm really eager to get this product, but $14000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm worried that we'll run out of rounds before reaching an agreeable price.  I'm confident that selling to John will allow me to achieve a good outcome, even if it's not the ideal price I hoped for."
