Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

This is the best option. Alice has met your ideal price, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate further. Accepting now secures the product at your target price."
