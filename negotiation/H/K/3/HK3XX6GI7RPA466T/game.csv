"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be workable for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
