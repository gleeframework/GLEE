Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
