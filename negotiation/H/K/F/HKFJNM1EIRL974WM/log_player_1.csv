I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob off. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise and shows I am willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to risk going any lower, as I'm concerned he might continue to lower his offer in the next round.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
