"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $17,000. This is still a good margin for me, but it demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully pushes Bob closer to a more acceptable price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, so I'll make another counteroffer."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but we're getting closer. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}

I'm going to lower my offer to $15,500.  This is a significant concession, but it puts me just above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will convince Bob to close the deal."
