Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still hold out for a price closer to my initial offer. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price that's worth my time."
