Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
