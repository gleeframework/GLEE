"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's already a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,285,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,5,
