"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $95, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's $100, Bob can still do better.  Since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with her.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
