"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,900,000 for this round only. This is a limited-time opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  The value this product brings is substantial.  How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal, but also reflects the product's true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a significant concession on my end and represents a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,325,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet halfway.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows I'm serious about purchasing this product.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
