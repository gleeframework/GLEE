"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,900,000 for this round only. This is a limited-time opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would cost you $1,000,000, but you may be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  The value this product brings is substantial.  How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal, but also reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer, as you still have some room to work with. Buying from John immediately would mean paying $1,000,000, but there's a chance you can get a better price through continued negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a significant concession on my end and represents a fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit higher than you'd like. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. Buying from John immediately would cost you $1,000,000, but you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,325,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet halfway.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows I'm serious about purchasing this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
