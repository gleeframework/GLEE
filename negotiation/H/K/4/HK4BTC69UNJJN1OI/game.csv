"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is outside of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is still too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
