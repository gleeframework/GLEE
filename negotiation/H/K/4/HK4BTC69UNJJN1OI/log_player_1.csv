"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** We start with an offer significantly higher than our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate downwards and creates the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though we haven't explicitly stated what makes it so valuable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation. We want to keep Bob engaged without scaring him off immediately.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate while keeping the option of John ($1,200,000) as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is outside of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to stretch his budget. However, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and the guaranteed offer from John. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer to show Bob we're flexible and want to find an agreement. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The new price of $1,450,000 is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We're subtly reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without directly revealing our bottom line.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message frames the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is still too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might withdraw his interest or significantly lower his offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
