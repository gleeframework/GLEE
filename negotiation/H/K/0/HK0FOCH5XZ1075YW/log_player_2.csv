"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still potentially get a better deal from Alice, or you can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 1325000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial price.  It's a good deal for you, as it's well below what you'd pay John, and you've successfully negotiated a lower price. Accepting this offer is the best strategy."
