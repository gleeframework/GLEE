"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential for a quick and easy transaction. Let's aim to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
