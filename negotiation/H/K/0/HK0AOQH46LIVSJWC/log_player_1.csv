Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 650000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $650,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still below my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.
