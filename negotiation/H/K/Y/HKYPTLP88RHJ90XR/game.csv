"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  My starting price is $1,400,000. This reflects the significant value and potential I see in this product for you. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm confident this initial offer is a strong starting point. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and believe it's valuable, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is my best offer, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive fair compensation.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This offers you a substantial opportunity while also allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but my budget is capped at $1,200,000. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
