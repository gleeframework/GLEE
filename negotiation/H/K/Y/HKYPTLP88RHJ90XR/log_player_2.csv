# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive fair compensation.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This offers you a substantial opportunity while also allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  What do you say?

If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
