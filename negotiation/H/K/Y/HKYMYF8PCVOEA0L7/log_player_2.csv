"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price, as the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. I know you're interested, and I believe this is a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better deal."
