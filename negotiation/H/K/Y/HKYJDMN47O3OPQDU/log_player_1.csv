Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  I'm hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial.  

This offer gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants, but it also makes it clear that I'm not willing to sell it for significantly less than my minimum price. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'm also open to selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,000. This is still a fair bit lower than my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this price is more reasonable and gives Bob a better chance to get the product while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is still below my minimum target, it's getting closer. It seems like Bob is pushing as hard as he's going to.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether, I'll accept his offer. It's better to secure a sale now than to hold out for a potentially higher price and end up with nothing."
