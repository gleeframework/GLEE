,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $22000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is this something you'd be comfortable with?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $22000 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $20000?",20000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $21000. This is as low as I can go, so please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the price I was willing to sell it to John for. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay that, I'll consider it a fair deal. However, if not, I'll have to consider moving forward with John's offer.",20000.0,Alice,7,
