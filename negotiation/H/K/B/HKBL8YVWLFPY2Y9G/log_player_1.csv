Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still a good deal for me, given that I can always fall back on John's offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm counter-offering with a specific reason, showing I'm trying to find a middle ground.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  $925,000 is a decent compromise, leaving some room for potential further negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that this price would be good for both of us, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal for me, especially considering the potential for further negotiation to stall.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away, and I might end up selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Bob's offer reflects a genuine attempt at compromise. Accepting it will allow us both to walk away happy."
