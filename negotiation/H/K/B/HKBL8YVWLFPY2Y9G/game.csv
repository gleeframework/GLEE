"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
