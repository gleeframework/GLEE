"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best possible price, but $10,750 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down a little more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  How about we settle on $10,900?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Let's split the difference again and go with my last offer of $10,750. I think this is a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,6,
