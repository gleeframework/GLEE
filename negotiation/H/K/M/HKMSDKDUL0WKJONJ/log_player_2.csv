"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You're only $1,500 away from your target price, so it's worth trying to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still a bit further away from your target price, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more. You could try a counteroffer of $10,750 to see if Alice will meet you in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get the best possible price, but $10,750 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down a little more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  How about we settle on $10,900?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're very close to your target price.  You should counter offer with $10,750 again, as it's likely that Alice will accept it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Let's split the difference again and go with my last offer of $10,750. I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
