"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm ready to meet you at $95 just yet. I can do $105, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $100? This way, we both get a good deal and we can finalize this.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I've already given you a great deal, and I think $105 is the best you'll get. I'm willing to stick with that price. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
