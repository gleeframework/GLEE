Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Fallback Option:** We have a secure fallback option with John at $1,500,000, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit with Bob while having a safety net with John."
