It's a great deal at $500,000, but there's room for negotiation.  We should try to get an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a lower offer and see where we can land.  $300,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer and should give us some room to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but $400,000 is still a bit high. I'll counter again to see if we can get closer to my target."

Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement at $350,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both live with."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000.

Alice has come down to $450,000, which is a good price considering my budget of $1,200,000. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking going back and forth with counteroffers and potentially ending up buying from John at a much higher price."
