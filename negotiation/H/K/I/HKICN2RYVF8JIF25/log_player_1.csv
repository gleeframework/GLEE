Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. My asking price is $14,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and direct, explaining the value of the product to Bob and setting my expectations. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation on a positive note while maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than my minimum value. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price range, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome. 
* **Maintain my position:**  By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and value the product at a higher price. This can strengthen my negotiating position.

Selling to John immediately would be a missed opportunity as I could potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $13,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly but firm. I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. I also highlight the benefit of reaching a compromise. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a favorable position:** It keeps the price higher than my minimum, demonstrating that I'm still confident in the product's worth.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:** By showing willingness to compromise, it increases the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell for more, accepting his offer ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential loss by selling to John. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Meeting minimum goal:**  $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, so accepting ensures I achieve my financial objective.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to more rejections and a potential deadlock, wasting time and effort.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately deciding to not buy the product. Selling to John would result in the same price, but accepting Bob's offer ensures the sale happens now."
