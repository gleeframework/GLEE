Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. This product is highly sought after and I know you'll greatly benefit from it."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and doesn't mention your other buyer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Market Conditions:**  Is this a hot market where similar products are selling quickly?  That might give you more leverage."
