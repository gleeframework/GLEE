"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $750000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $825000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $835000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",835000.0,Alice,5,
