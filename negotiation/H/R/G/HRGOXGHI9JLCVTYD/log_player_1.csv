{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also showing I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. I want to try and get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there with $7,800. Let's try $8,000 - that's my bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to making a decision, but $8,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm running out of time and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. It's better to take the sure thing rather than risk losing out on a sale completely."
