"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I can do $90, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $70?  That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $85, which is a bit higher than your last offer. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're so close! I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? It's a deal if you're agreeable.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. But I'm not willing to sell at $80. I'll meet you at $82.50, and that's my final offer. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,7,
