"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it also shows him that I value the product highly.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I can afford to be a little more demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to potentially improve the deal. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility while still demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price yet. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds. I'm still hoping to get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal than selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  While I would prefer to get a better deal than $1,200,000, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might result in a worse outcome.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale to John rather than risk getting stuck with an even lower price."
