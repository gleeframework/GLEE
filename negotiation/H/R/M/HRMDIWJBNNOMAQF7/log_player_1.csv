"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm starting significantly higher ($2,200,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** The guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000 acts as my ""walk-away"" point. I won't accept anything less than that.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate as it is about the actual price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I understand its value, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob increased his offer considerably, $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a substantial gap between our valuations, suggesting room for further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the product's value to me is considerably higher than what you've proposed.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth while still acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop, but above the minimum:** I've lowered my price by $400,000, demonstrating flexibility. However, the new price is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 safety net from John's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I continue to reinforce the product's high value, both to me and potentially to Bob, hoping to justify the still-high price.
* **Seeking middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a price point somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now greater than my guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000).
* **Strong likelihood of closing:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, showing a strong desire to purchase the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him reducing his offer or stalling negotiations further. 
* **Time value of money:**  While I could try to push for more, closing the deal now provides immediate value and eliminates uncertainty."
