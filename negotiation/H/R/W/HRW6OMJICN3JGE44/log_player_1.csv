Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000, meaning she won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, indicating he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **John's Safety Net:** John acts as a guarantee for Alice, ensuring she'll at least earn $1,000,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that maximizes her profit while ensuring Bob accepts. This involves understanding Bob's perspective.  Bob would find any price below $1,500,000 beneficial.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,490,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable Price:** $1,490,000 is slightly below Bob's maximum valuation. This makes it highly likely he'll accept, as he saves $10,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to decide quickly and not risk losing out on the deal.

**Important Note:** This assumes no further negotiation rounds. In a real-world scenario, Bob might counter-offer, leading to further negotiation."
