Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's always best to try for a higher price first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($149) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He might be more inclined to accept, thinking he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this message doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, Bob could counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit too high."
