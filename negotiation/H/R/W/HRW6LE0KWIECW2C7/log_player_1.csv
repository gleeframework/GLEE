Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting the exclusivity adds perceived value and might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your approach accordingly.
* **Market Information:** While you have John as a backup, knowing if there are other potential buyers and their willingness to pay could influence your strategy.

**This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer.**"
