"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it, given it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $150.  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be able to make the purchase right away.",150.0,Bob,4,
