"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That's a fair compromise, I think.",107.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to keep my budget within $100. Could we perhaps aim for $98? It's a slight compromise from both our previous positions, aiming for a fair deal for both of us.",98.0,Bob,4,
