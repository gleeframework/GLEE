"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? It's a reasonable offer that gets us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $8,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's finalize this before I have to explore other options. ",8000.0,Alice,5,
