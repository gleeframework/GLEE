Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still making a decent profit and leaving room for further negotiations. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:** By stating your desired price upfront, you avoid wasting time on lengthy negotiations. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. You can likely get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's worth trying to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a decent compromise and a good deal considering the risk of further negotiations. You're getting close to your minimum and there's a chance Bob won't budge further.  It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $1,200,000."
