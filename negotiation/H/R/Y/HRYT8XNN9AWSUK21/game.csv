"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,500?  This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties.  Let's finalize this.",11000.0,Bob,4,
