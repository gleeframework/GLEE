"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice! I see the value in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
