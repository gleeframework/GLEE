"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $9000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $8750? This is a reasonable compromise, and it's within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8750 just yet. I can offer you a price of $8900. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8900.0,Alice,5,
