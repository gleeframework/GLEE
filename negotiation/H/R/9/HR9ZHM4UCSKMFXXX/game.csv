"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my desired price.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and aim for $10,375?",10375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,375 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my price point.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer. How about we settle for $10,400? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",10400.0,Bob,6,
