"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a fantastic product at a price that's below market value, and I get to move it quickly.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in saving as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is $900,000, which is higher than what I'm willing to pay ($800,000), I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
