Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $8,000. How about $7,900? That's a firm offer on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to $8,000, his firm offer is still below my minimum. It's not worth the risk of him going even lower in further rounds. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
