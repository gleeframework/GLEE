"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, I find the price a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
