"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $1,350,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves you with a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
