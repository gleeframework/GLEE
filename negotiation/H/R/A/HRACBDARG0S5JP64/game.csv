"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a chance for you to secure a valuable asset. Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
