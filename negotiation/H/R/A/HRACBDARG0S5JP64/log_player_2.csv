"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers is well worth it. Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a chance for you to secure a valuable asset. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my maximum budget. While I would prefer to pay less, I've already reached the limit of what I'm willing to spend.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product without going over my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
