"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is above my initial budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
