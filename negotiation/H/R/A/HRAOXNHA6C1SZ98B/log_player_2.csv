"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item at a discounted rate. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is closer to your maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with your backup plan of buying from John."
