"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. My initial offer is $800,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value for this type of product, and it's within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your estimate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This reflects a compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000.
