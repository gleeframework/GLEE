"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you're asking for a significant profit, but still leave room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer, it's still higher than what John is offering. You have 8 rounds remaining, so there is still room for negotiation and a potential higher offer from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and hopefully reach a price closer to your desired $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer shows that you are willing to compromise but you are still aiming for a price that is closer to your initial offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  Since we have several rounds left, it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate a better price with Bob.  We've already shown a willingness to compromise, and we can likely meet in the middle with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant compromise.  We're now at the point where we are accepting John's offer. However, it's worth testing the waters one more time with Bob to see if he's willing to meet us at $1,000,000."
