Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point, and would hate for you to miss out."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer, exceeding Bob's perceived value of $12,000. However, it leaves room for me to negotiate down slightly if needed while still staying above my minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning that I would ""hate for you to miss out,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
