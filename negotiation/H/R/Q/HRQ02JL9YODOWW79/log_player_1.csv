Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product. I look forward to your response.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $960,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations risks losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Accepting John's offer is the most profitable decision."
