"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $100. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $95. It's a good compromise, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
