"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000.  This is a firm offer, reflecting the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
