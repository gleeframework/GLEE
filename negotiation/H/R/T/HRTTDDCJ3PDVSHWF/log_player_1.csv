{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers tremendous value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price very close to your guaranteed sale price.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 provides a strong safety net, allowing you to confidently aim high with Bob."
