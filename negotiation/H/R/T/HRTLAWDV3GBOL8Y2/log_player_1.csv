Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can gradually lower the price in subsequent counteroffers, testing his willingness to pay.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage and prevents me from accepting offers significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent offer, I'm aiming to get as close to $115 as possible. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to entice him while still aiming higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?"", 
""product_price"": 112.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $112.50, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a higher price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, signaling that I believe in the product's value. This approach aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $112. I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $112 is very close to my initial asking price and only slightly below my ideal target.  
* **""Best I Can Do"" Signal:** His language (""as low as I can go"") suggests this might be his final offer, and pushing further risks losing the sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could counter again, the potential gain from a few more dollars is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit."
