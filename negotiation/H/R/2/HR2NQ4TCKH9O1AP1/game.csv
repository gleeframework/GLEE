"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product has significant value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 to $1000000. I appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations.  While $900000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000. This price still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the value I hold in this product, while also presenting a significant opportunity for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
