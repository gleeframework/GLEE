Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
