Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start there. Opening with a higher price leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $12,000 creates a substantial perceived discount while still remaining significantly above Bob's valuation.  
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This knowledge allows her to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

This approach aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering Bob an attractive price."
