I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation. The risk of continuing and potentially getting a lower offer or having the negotiation drag on is too high.  I'll accept John's offer for $1,200,000 to secure a sale and avoid further uncertainty."
