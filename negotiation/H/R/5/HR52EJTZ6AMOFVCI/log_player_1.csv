"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic message:**  The message is positive and highlights the value of the product to create interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being aggressive but letting Bob know I'm open to discussion. 

This approach balances the need to get a good price while encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. There's room for further negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Middle ground:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise and suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" approach.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $11500 is a fair price for the product. It's a bit lower than your previous offer, but I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value ($10,000), I still have room for negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars. I'm confident that I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's latest offer and proposing a counter-offer that's closer to his price but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price considering the product's value.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $12250 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still a bit too low. I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This price acknowledges your budget and also reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again acknowledging Bob's offer and proposing a counter-offer that's closer to his price but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price considering both Bob's budget and the product's value. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept.

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also acknowledging that we might not have much more room for negotiation. The choice will depend on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $10750, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is only $750 above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. With only two rounds left, the risk of rejecting his offer and going through another round of counter-offers is too high. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a much better price from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price while minimizing the risk of ending up with the lower price from John."
