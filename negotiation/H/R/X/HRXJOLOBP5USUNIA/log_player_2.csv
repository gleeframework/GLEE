"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $120. To start, I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's best to reject Alice's initial offer. While her message hints at flexibility, $140 is still above your maximum budget. By counter-offering, you can try to negotiate a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Anchoring:** This counter-offer attempts to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and appreciative tone is important for a successful negotiation, even when making a lowball offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with $125. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's close enough to your $120 target that it's not worth the risk of her raising the price again or the negotiation failing."
