# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer, as you know you can get the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you open to potentially getting a better deal later, or if you decide you definitely want the product, you can always go back to John."
