"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is closer to your target, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking to get the best deal possible.  How about $8,750?  That's halfway between our last offers."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,875?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now below your maximum budget of $10,000, and it's closer to your desired price than John's offer. It's a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price."
