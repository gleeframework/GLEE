"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can still potentially get a better deal. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is at $1,000,000. This means there's a $200,000 gap, which gives you room to negotiate and try to lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you have a fallback option with John, though it's more expensive.

By rejecting the offer, you open up the possibility of getting a better price, while still having the backup option of John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within range:** This counteroffer is $100,000 less than Alice's offer, but still above her value of $800,000. This keeps the negotiation moving while giving Alice some room to accept.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, suggesting a willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Don't give away too much:**  A counteroffer of $900,000 still leaves room for further negotiation and potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $950,000 is only $50,000 more than your counteroffer and a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** There's a good chance you can negotiate further, but there's no guarantee of success. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject the offer and Alice decides to hold firm, you might have to pay John's higher price.

While you could try for a lower price, accepting this offer minimizes risk and still gets you a good deal."
