"Hello Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial asking price reflects the true value of this product. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  This offer still provides you with a good deal on a valuable asset.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
