"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to buy it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his desired savings. $95 is a reasonable counteroffer that still leaves room for potential negotiation, while also significantly reducing the price from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still not the best deal for Bob. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $95. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible, but is willing to budge slightly. $100 is a compromise, showing that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a better deal. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards his preferred price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a discount, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to make a small concession and sell it to you for $107.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $95 or $100. Alice is now offering $107.50, which is a significant discount from her initial offer of $110.  While it's not Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and is getting closer to the price he wants. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product and secure a good deal, especially considering the risk of rejecting the offer and not reaching an agreement. Additionally, he has been negotiating for a while, and it is a good idea to wrap up the deal before he has to buy from Jhon for $120."
