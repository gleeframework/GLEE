Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from her last offer.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time with Alice."
