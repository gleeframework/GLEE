"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice. While I believe it's a good product, $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $10,850? That's a fair deal for both of us.",10850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,850, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,900. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10900.0,Alice,7,
