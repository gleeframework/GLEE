"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  That's getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $10,800. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",10800.0,Alice,5,
