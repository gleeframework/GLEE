Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the product's value, hoping to sway Bob towards accepting. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to discuss the offer, signaling flexibility.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Aiming for a price closer to your minimum ($120) while acknowledging Bob's perceived value.
* **Avoid immediate John deal:** This offer allows for negotiation with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed $120 from John.
* **Potential counteroffers:**  This strategy opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While $90 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below your desired price point of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $120 provides a strong bargaining position against Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  While $90 is a decent deal, it's not the best possible outcome.  
* **Avoiding a sub-optimal deal:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower profit margin. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can use John's offer as leverage to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $100 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** The counteroffer of $95 is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** The message explains that the offer needs to be closer to $100, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **""Meet me halfway"" approach:** This phrasing suggests a collaborative negotiation and makes the counteroffer appear reasonable.

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming for higher profit:** $95 is a better price than $90, bringing me closer to my desired profit.
* **Showing flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm position on the value of the product.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still considering the potential to sell to John at $120."

# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $92 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has explicitly stated that this is his final offer, signaling that further negotiation may not be productive.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $120 provides a strong safety net, allowing you to accept Bob's offer without significant loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing potential for further negotiation:** This approach avoids potentially wasting time on further negotiations with Bob, which might not result in a higher price.
* **Balancing profit with time efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a reasonable profit margin without jeopardizing the deal with John.
