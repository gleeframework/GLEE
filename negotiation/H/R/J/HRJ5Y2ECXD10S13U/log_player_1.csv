"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, starting at $2,000,000 leaves space to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility. His response will reveal how far apart your valuations are and inform your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I understand its value, I believe we can find a more agreeable price. My counteroffer would be $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Too Early to Sell to John:** While selling to John guarantees your minimum desired price, there's a good chance you can secure a better deal with Bob. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for the guaranteed option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're seeking a higher price while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious. While I recognize your proposed value, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  By decreasing the price to $1,900,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer keeps the price relatively high, aiming to anchor the negotiation around a number more favorable to you. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages continued discussion, fostering a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I would like to keep our negotiations within my budget. My counteroffer would be $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Profitable:** While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to your guaranteed price from John, it's still a significant profit margin above your minimum.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to move closer to your range. There are likely still opportunities to negotiate a better price.
* **Information Gathering:** Each round provides valuable information about Bob's willingness to pay. Continued negotiation can help you determine his upper limit. 

You'll reject this offer but need to carefully consider your next move to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** By dropping the price to $1,850,000, you're making a more substantial concession to signal your willingness to make a deal. This shows flexibility while staying above your guaranteed price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer positions the compromise as a win-win solution.  It emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a move closer to your range.
* **Limited Time:** With each round, the risk of Bob walking away increases. This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal before the option of selling to John becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. My counteroffer would be $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is still a significant $300,000 above your guaranteed offer from John, representing a healthy profit margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away.  The potential gains from further negotiation are likely small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate revenue, which is generally preferable to a potentially slightly higher amount later.

While you could try to push for a bit more, accepting at this point secures a very good outcome."
