Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to keep going back and forth with him. I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I'm going to take that deal."
