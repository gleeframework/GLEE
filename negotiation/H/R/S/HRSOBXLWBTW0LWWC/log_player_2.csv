"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation of $8,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price considering the value you place on it and my interest in buying it."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and your interest in buying it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved from $12,000 to $11,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could make another counteroffer, it's unlikely Alice will drop much further from $11,000. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while still saving money compared to John's price."
