"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
