"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $125, which is significantly closer to my target price of $120. 
* **Reasonable compromise:** This price is still higher than Alice's value of $120, but it offers some wiggle room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  My message is friendly and encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go lower than $135. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my target price, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can get closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:**  I'm offering $130, which is exactly in the middle of Alice's last offer ($135) and my previous offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I frame the offer as a fair deal for both of us. This might make Alice more receptive.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and constructive tone to encourage continued negotiations."
