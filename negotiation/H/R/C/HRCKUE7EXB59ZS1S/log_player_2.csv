"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 10 rounds, so there's room to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach, starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial proposal. This puts pressure on Alice and signals Bob's willingness to negotiate.  The offer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer saves $50,000 compared to John's price and is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, especially with the time constraint."
