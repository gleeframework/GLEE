"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While $140 is close to my limit, I'd like to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice first before resorting to buying from John at my absolute maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price I'd be happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I'm still willing to push for a better deal. It's worth seeing if she'll come down another $5 to match John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and make it $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a compromise right in the middle of our current offers. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target that's still advantageous for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $118.75?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now only slightly above John's price. While I could try to haggle further, the potential savings are minimal, and I risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. It's a fair deal, and I'd rather secure the product now."
