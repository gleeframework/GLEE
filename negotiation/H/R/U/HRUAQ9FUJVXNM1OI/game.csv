"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $118.75?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",118.75,Alice,5,
