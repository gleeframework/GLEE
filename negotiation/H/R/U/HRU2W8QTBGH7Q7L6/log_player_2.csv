"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is cheaper than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit as the product is only worth $80 to her. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still a good deal for Bob. It's less than his maximum budget of $150, and it's a reasonable compromise after his previous counteroffer was rejected. Further negotiation could potentially get the price down further, but the risk of Alice rejecting the next offer and the potential for a drawn-out process makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
