"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is below the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I still feel that $12,500 is a bit high given my budget constraints. Could you consider lowering the price to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to agree on $11,750?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
