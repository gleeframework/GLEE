"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,050,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking we could meet at $1,075,000. That's a bit closer to my target, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
