Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. This price also gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not high enough. Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
