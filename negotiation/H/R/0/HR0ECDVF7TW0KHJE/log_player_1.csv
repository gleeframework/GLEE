Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm offering a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, so I expect a counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is not willing to pay my initial asking price, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Opportunity cost of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees me $100, it's worth exploring the negotiation with Bob further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $110.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:** $90 is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Risk of losing John:**  While I could keep negotiating with Bob, there's a risk of him continuing to offer low prices.  
* **John is a safer option:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is higher than what Bob is currently offering.
* **No significant leverage:** Bob is not showing a willingness to increase his offer significantly. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and explore selling to John to secure a guaranteed higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last stand:**  This is my final counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum while still demonstrating flexibility.
* **Compromise:** Offering $85 shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer.
* **Evaluating the risks:**  While I could sell to John for $100, there's still a chance of closing the deal with Bob at a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to take that risk to potentially maximize my earnings."
