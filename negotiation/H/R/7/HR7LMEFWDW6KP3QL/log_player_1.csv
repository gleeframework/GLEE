Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good deal.
* **Value proposition:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob by stating that he will appreciate it.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between being assertive and leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than my minimum of $80, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. He clearly sees value in the product ($150) and has already shown interest.  

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $120 to $110, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value reiteration:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying he'll ""love"" it.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone helps build rapport and encourage a deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a good price."
