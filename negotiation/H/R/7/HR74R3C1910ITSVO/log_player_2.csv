Alice's starting price is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80 while still leaving me room to negotiate upwards. By starting lower, I might be able to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

``` 

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still a bit high. I'll try to meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
 ""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($70) and her current offer ($85). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $82, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is firm on her price, and $82 is a reasonable deal. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $100."
