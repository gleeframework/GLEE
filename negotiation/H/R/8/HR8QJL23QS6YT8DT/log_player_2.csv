# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's best to counteroffer Alice and see if she'll come down closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, so let me know if you're willing to meet me there.

Bob has already countered twice and Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still more than he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's better for Bob to go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000. He's already gotten a good deal from John and there's a risk that if he keeps negotiating with Alice, he might end up paying more than he wants."
