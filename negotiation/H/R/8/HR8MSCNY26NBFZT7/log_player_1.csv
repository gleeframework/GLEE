"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price right away or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $130. This is still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's only $5 above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120.  Bob has shown a pattern of lowballing offers, and while $100 is closer to my minimum, I don't have a lot of time left to reach a deal. I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further, and John provides a guaranteed, acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's a safe and timely choice."
