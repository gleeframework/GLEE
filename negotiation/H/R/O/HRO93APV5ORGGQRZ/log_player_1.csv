Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chances of him accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay, I'm going to reject it. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
