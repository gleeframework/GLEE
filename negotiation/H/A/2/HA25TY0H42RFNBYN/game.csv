"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the price I was willing to accept from John, but I'm still willing to negotiate. However, I need to make one last push to get a better price. I'm counteroffering at $1090000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
