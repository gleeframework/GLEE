"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. Can you consider that?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I can offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a slight adjustment, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155. Can you consider that?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more slight adjustment. I can offer it to you for $160. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",155.0,Bob,8,
