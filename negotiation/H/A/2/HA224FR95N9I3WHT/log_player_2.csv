I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving $100,000."
