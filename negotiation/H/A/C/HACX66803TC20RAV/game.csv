"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept a price that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while considering your interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,600,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
