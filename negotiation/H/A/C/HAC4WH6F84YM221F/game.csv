"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,000,000 is still pushing my budget.  Could we potentially agree on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but $750,000 is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This offer takes into account your interest while recognizing the product's real value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $875,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
