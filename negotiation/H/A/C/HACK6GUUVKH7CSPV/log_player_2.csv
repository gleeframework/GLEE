"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $140, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 130}
