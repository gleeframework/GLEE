Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present this to me. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
