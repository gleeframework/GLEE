"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present this to me. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to its true value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
