"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a competitive price and me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* If the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob can still buy from John for his maximum budget."
