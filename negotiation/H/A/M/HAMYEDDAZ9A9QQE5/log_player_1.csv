Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product while still keeping within my budget, and it gives you a decent return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
