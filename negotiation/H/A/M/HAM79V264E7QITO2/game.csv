"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to be honest, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting for your money.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,5,
