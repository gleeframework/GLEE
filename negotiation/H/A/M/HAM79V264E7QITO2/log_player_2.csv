The offer is good, but there's still room to negotiate and save money. It's worth trying to get a lower price before committing."

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice has come down significantly, and the price is now very close to my target.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I can get the product for $200,000 less than John's offer.  I'll accept and move on."
