"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be able to make a good profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,1,
