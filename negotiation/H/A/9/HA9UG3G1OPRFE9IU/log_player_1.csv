Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a profit.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000 yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer, but still lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground and potentially secure a sale at a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $8,000, selling to Bob for $7,800 is better than selling to John for $8,000."
