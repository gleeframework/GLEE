"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still above Bob's perceived value. This will hopefully entice Bob to consider the offer while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a bit below my desired price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
