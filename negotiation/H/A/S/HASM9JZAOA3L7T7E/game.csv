"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a bit below my desired price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
