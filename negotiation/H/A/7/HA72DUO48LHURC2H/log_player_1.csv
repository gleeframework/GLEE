"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  While I want to maximize profit, I'm also being realistic.  Bob likely won't accept this first offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm aiming for at least $100, so accepting $90 would be below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. While $90 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:** Although I could sell to John for $100, it's better to keep negotiating with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is closer, I'm still looking to get closer to $100.  I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my desired price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Showing Flexibility:** By coming down from my initial offer, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** The message is still friendly and open to further discussion, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has come down in his offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I have more rounds left, so there's still opportunity to get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  Selling to John for $100 is always a possibility, but I'd rather keep negotiating with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $90 for the product.  This is really close to my bottom line, so I hope you can consider it. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $5 above Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Bottom Line:** I'm stating that this is close to my minimum price, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm getting closer, there are still rounds remaining, and I can potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **John is Always an Option:**  Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I'm willing to risk negotiating further to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.50.  I don't think I can go lower than that, but I'm eager to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $87.50, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Almost Bottom Line:** I'm stating that this is almost my bottom line, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to push Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the chances of getting Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum of $100 are slim. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, which is my primary goal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a small chance I could get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of not closing a deal with either buyer outweighs the potential reward."
