"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. That's a great price for both of us - you get a fantastic deal, and I can still make a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
