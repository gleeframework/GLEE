Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's a good idea to:

* **Start high:** I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also leaving room to negotiate. 
* **Be friendly and open:** This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:**  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $75, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $81.25.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $81.25 is a good price, and it's higher than what John would pay.  It's important to recognize that negotiations are about finding a price that works for both parties, and we've reached a point where that's possible."
