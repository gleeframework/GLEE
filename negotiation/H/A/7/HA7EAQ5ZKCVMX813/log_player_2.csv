"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  By rejecting, Bob opens the opportunity to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount, showing Bob is serious about buying but also trying to find a price that works for him. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $100.  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $81.25.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 81.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer but staying below Bob's target of $100. It's also a logical step, offering half the difference between the previous offers. This shows a commitment to negotiating while still trying to get the best possible price."
