Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming for a price slightly below that maximizes potential profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind. 

This strategy seeks to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the backup offer from John."
