Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $14,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500.  To maximize savings and stay within budget, it's best to buy from John for $10,000."
