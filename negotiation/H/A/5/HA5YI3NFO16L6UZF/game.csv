"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll agree once you have it.  Let's close the deal at $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
