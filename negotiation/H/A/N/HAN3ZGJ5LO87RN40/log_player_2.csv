The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $150. This is a bad deal for you. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is too low for me. Could you do $135?

You can still do better than $135.  Reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
