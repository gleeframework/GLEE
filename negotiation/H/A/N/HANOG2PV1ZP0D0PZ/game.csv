"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product is good, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $7,250. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. $7,250 is very close, but to be honest, $7,100 is the highest I can go.  What do you think?",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,100 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight adjustment at $7,150. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7150.0,Alice,7,
