"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.  It's worth $10,000 to you, and John is selling it for that price. You'd be overpaying by $1,000 if you accepted Alice's offer."
