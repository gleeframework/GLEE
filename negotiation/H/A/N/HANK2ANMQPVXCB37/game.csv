"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already given you a pretty good price at $90. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $88, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it!",88.0,Alice,5,
