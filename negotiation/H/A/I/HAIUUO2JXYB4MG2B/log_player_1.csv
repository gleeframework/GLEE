Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to start with a price significantly higher to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This allows me to potentially secure a price higher than $10,000 but lower than my initial offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey the product's value without sounding too aggressive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the best possible price, either from Bob or from my backup buyer, John."
