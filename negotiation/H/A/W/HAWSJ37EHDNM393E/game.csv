"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a solid return. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
