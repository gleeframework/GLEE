"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This price is fair to both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer at $85. However, I must also consider my own business needs. Therefore, I propose we meet in the middle at $87.50 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",87.5,Alice,3,
