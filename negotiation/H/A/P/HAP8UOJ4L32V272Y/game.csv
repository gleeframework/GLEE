"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
