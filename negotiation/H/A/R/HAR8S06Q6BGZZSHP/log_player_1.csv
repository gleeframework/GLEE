"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also being friendly to try and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't go that low.  How about $95?  I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us might be happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your product, but I believe $80 is still a fair price considering my budget constraints. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $85 is still below my minimum.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this is a good compromise and that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Considering my budget, I am willing to offer $85 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the sale completely. John is offering my minimum, so I'll sell the product to him to ensure a guaranteed sale."
