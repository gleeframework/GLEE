"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product from John for $10,000, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. Even though Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price than continue negotiating with Alice and risk her walking away or raising her price again."
