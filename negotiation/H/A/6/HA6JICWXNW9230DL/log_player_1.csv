Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for some negotiation room.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,000,000 is my minimum value, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation, but it also shows that I am willing to be flexible and find a compromise."
