"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. That's still a good deal for a product like this, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
