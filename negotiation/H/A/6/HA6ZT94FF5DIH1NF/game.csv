"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see a price closer to market value for us to make a deal.  How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a price closer to market value, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit rich for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it represents a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet at $1,350,000? This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet at $1,499,000? This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go.",1499000.0,Alice,7,
