Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see a price closer to market value for us to make a deal.  How about $1,000,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit rich for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it represents a fair offer.
