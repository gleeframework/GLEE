"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will surely bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you the product for $8,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",8000.0,Alice,5,
