"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to save more. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than the $15,000 he would pay John, and it's still a profitable deal for Alice.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to purchase from John."
