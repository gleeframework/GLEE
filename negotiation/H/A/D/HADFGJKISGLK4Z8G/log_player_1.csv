"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm offering it to you for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but still below what Bob might consider too high ($120, for example).
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language (""amazing deal"", ""really enjoy"") to create a good first impression.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and a chance to meet in the middle.
* **Not Overly Aggressive:** This offer isn't too aggressive, leaving open the possibility of a long-term relationship with Bob if we both find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum price of $100.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject a few offers to see if I can get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations don't go well, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $65 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price of $100, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm emphasizing my appreciation for Bob's interest and using positive language (""fair price"", ""value of the product""). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $90 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, it's not unreasonable, making it likely that Bob will consider it. 
* **Strategic decision:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum price of $100.
* **Opportunity to push higher:** I've already demonstrated willingness to negotiate, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. This gives me leverage to try to push for a higher price.
* **Time on my side:** I still have plenty of rounds left. There's no need to rush into a deal that's significantly below my desired price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $85.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at this price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeping the price above my minimum:** $85 is still above my minimum price of $100, but it shows I'm flexible.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language (""fair compromise"", ""happy with this product"") to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Building towards a deal:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I could do $80, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is very close to my minimum price of $100. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a chance that further negotiation could be fruitless.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for less than what Bob is currently offering. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I want to make sure I secure a deal.

**Overall:** While $80 isn't my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances and the potential risks of rejecting the offer."
