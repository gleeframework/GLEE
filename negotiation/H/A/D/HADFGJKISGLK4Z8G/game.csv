,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. Would that work for you?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $65 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $85.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at this price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could do $80, but that's really my limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
