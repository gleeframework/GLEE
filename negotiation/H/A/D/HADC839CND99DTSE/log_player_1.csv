Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $12,000 is less than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
