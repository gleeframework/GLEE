"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I like the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good relationship with Alice while clearly stating your price limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to negotiate significantly, we might get a great deal. If not, we can adjust our approach in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Prices:** Alice has come down to your maximum budget of $100. 
* **No Room for Improvement:** Since John also offers the product at $100, continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the best possible price without risking losing the deal."
