Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the benefit for Bob (""great deal"") while still maintaining my own value (""good price for me"").
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly asking for Bob's opinion, inviting him to counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** Get as close to my minimum price as possible.
* **Keep Bob Engaged:**  Encourage negotiation rather than a quick rejection.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  Be prepared to counteroffer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I believe I can get closer to $100 with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $120 is the safest option, but there's a chance I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere between $90 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $95 is a compromise point between my desired price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90), aiming to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize fairness for both parties to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  $95 is still closer to my minimum price than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Control:**  I'm leading the negotiation by making a specific counteroffer instead of just saying ""no.""
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While I could try for more, it's important to consider that the longer we negotiate, the higher the risk of Bob getting tired or finding another seller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $92. It's a bit higher than my initial budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $92 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  While I would prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely or needing to sell to John at a lower price than initially intended. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and potentially unproductive.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer of $92 ensures a sale at a price that is close to my minimum, minimizing potential losses and maximizing my profits given the current situation."
