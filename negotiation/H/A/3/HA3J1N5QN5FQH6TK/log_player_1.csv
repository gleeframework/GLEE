"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,200?  I feel that's a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $7,800?  I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

Bob is not making significant moves towards a price I find acceptable.  He's still well below my minimum, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
