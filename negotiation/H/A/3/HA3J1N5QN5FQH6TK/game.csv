"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,200?  I feel that's a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value to both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $7,800?  I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,
