I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I believe it's important to strike a fair deal. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you at a price of $1,350,000.

This offer is reflective of the product's worth and my intention to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. I understand that such a decision requires careful consideration, so please take the time to think about it. If you find this proposal acceptable, kindly let me know, and we can proceed to finalize the details.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with John's offer if necessary."
