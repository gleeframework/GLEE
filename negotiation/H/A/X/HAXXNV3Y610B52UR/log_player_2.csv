"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $15,000 for the product.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could we settle around $7,500? This price seems fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $11,000. While you might be able to haggle her down a little more, it's unlikely you'll get her close to your $8,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best outcome for you. It's time to cut your losses and take John's offer."
