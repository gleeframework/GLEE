You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to pay no more than $12,000 and Alice's offer is higher than that. You can counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. At this point, it's better to purchase the product from John for $12,000 and avoid any further negotiation."
