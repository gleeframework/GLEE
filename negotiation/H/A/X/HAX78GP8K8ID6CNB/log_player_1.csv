Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $13,500 is a fair price considering my minimum value is $15,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with Bob.

This strategy allows me to potentially get a price closer to my desired value while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Even though Bob has rejected my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer as safety net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my desired value. This keeps the negotiation moving while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Bob's Offer:**  My counteroffer of $13,000 is only $500 higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, protecting my interests.
* **Positive Message:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while giving Bob a chance to make a final decision before I sell to John."
