"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is getting closer to your desired price.  It's still a bit above your target, but at this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
