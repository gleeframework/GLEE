Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before it hits the open market. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it directly from me."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" and ""open market,"" you create a sense of exclusivity and potential future price increases.  
* **Target Above Bob's Value:** Aiming for $18,000 allows you to potentially earn significantly more than your minimum. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land above $12,000. 

**Important:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects it or proposes a counter-offer. Remember, any price above $12,000 is a profit for you."
