"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $11,000. It's a good starting point considering my minimum is $12,000 and I have John as a backup buyer at that price. Hopefully, Bob sees the value and is willing to negotiate down from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and shows that I'm open to negotiating. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to settle for $8,500. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm not desperate. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $9,500. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more beneficial for me. We're getting closer to a deal, so I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offers are still below my acceptable threshold.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to an even lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's the best outcome for me at this point."
