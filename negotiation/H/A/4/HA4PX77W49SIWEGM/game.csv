"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value of the product to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I understand you find value in the product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect that.  While your offer is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to consider a compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair deal that acknowledges the value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a good faith effort to meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
