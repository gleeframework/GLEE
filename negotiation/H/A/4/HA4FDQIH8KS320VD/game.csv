"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer but I'm still limited by my budget. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,625?  This gives us both a good deal and helps us move forward. What do you think?",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,625 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $9,400 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can close this deal.  What do you say?",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. While $9,400 is a step in the right direction, I still need to be a little higher to make this work for me.  Let's try $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I'm willing to go up to $9,450 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",9450.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see we're almost there. While $9,450 is getting closer, I'm still a little short of where I need to be. To close this deal, I'm willing to go down to $9,475.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?",9475.0,Alice,9,
