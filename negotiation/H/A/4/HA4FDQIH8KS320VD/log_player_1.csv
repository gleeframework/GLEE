"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a decent profit while leaving room to potentially lower the price if necessary.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging**, emphasizing the value Bob would get. This builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially leading to a better outcome. 
* **Selling to John is always an option**, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm counter-offering with $10,000, which is a significant move from my initial $12,000 but still above Bob's $8,500.**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a major loss.
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob.** I want to keep the negotiation positive and avoid creating animosity.
* **I'm hoping this counteroffer will bridge the gap and encourage Bob to consider a deal.**  I'm willing to move closer to his price but still remain above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer but I'm still limited by my budget. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, accepting it would still result in a significant loss. 
* **I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further.**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.**  I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable outcome if I continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,625?  This gives us both a good deal and helps us move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm counter-offering with $9,625, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,250.** This shows I'm willing to compromise and meet him in the middle.
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes the ""good deal"" for both of us.** This keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **I'm hoping this counteroffer will close the deal, as it's getting closer to my desired price and should be appealing to Bob.** I'm confident that this offer is fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,625 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** Although it's getting closer, accepting would still result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **I'm confident I can push for a slightly better price.** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always a viable option, but I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob.** With a bit more negotiation, I might be able to reach a price that's more favorable for me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. While $9,400 is a step in the right direction, I still need to be a little higher to make this work for me.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,450 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's tempting to accept with only two rounds left, I need to push for a better price.
* **I'm confident I can reach a better deal with Bob.** I've shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise, and with a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob.**  With two rounds left, I have a good chance to negotiate a more favorable outcome."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see we're almost there. While $9,450 is getting closer, I'm still a little short of where I need to be. To close this deal, I'm willing to go down to $9,475.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9475}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm counter-offering with $9,475, which is only $25 away from Bob's offer of $9,450.** This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving up on getting a price that's closer to my desired price.
* **The message is still positive and emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" and the ability to ""finalize"" the deal.**  This keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **With only one round remaining, I need to make a strong move to secure a deal.** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it's a very small difference from his last offer. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
