Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is well above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can get the product from John for $10,000.  He should counteroffer again to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay.  Given that he knows he can get the same product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John and save the $3,500.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a price lower than $10,000."
