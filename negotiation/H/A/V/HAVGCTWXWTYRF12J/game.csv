"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $13,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think you're getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,5,
