"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a slightly discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. There's some room for negotiation before reaching John's $12,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to match the price you've proposed, but I would like to offer you the product for $11,000. This is my best offer considering the value of the product.

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"",

This keeps us moving towards a potential deal while still leaving some room to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My best offer now stands at $10,750.

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating and has met us very close to the middle.  This price saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer, so it makes sense to accept."
