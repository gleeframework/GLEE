"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  $1,400,000 is simply too far below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
