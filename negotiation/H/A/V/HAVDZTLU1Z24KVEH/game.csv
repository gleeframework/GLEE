"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
