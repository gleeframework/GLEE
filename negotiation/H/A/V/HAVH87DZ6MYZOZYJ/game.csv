"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $7,000 if possible. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but I am working within a budget. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $8,500 for the product.
