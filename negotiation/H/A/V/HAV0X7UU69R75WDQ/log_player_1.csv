Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 6

We're getting close, but still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing a point where we need to finalize this.  I'm willing to agree to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant discount while respecting the inherent value of what I'm offering."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we're close to John's offer, accepting Bob's offer at $1,600,000 is still a significant profit. It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate much higher with Bob, and risking losing him at this point could result in settling for John's $1,500,000."
