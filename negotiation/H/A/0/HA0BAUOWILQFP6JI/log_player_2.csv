Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll walk away from the negotiation. Accepting $8,250 secures us a decent discount from both our initial target ($7,000) and John's backup offer ($12,000)."
