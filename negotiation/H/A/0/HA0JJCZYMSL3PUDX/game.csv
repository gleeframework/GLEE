"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I think $900,000 is a fair compromise.  This would leave you with a substantial profit and still allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
