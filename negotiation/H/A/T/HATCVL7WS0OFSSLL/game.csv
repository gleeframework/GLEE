"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I have to say that $750000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $795000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
