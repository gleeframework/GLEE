"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, offering $130 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for Alice to make a small concession if she wants to close the deal, while still being a good price for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $140 to $135. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a situation where Alice walks away or you end up paying the $150 to John. Accepting Alice's offer at $135 is a reasonable compromise and saves you money compared to John."
