You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, but Alice is offering it for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to make a living. I can do $9500, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great price considering the product's value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob. He can save $2,500 compared to buying from John.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or John changing his price makes accepting a safer choice."
