"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $900000 at this time. I am willing to pay up to $850000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $850000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the reduction in price. However, I still feel that $875000 might not fully align with what I can afford at this time. I would like to propose $860000 as a potential compromise. I hope this offer will be acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
