Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $150.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept for the product. There's no room for negotiation to earn more.  I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
