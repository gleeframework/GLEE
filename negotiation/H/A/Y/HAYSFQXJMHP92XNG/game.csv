"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000?  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $8,200?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",8200.0,Bob,6,
