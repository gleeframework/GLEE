"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to find a price that is closer to my own valuation. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price that considers both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a higher offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $8,200?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to take the deal and secure the sale."
