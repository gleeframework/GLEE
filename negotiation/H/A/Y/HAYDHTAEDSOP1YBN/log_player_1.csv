Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will need to consider other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle at a price higher than John's offer.
* **Deadline Creates Urgency:**  A deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from stalling or undervaluing the product. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive opening price could be considered.
* **Market Knowledge:**  Is there a chance another buyer might offer more than John's $800,000? If so, you might adjust your strategy accordingly."
