{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 

By starting at $140, you leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensure you're well above your minimum selling point."
