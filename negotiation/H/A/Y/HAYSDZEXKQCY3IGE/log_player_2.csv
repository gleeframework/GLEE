"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000.  That means she's still getting a good deal, and it's unlikely she'll significantly drop the price. It's better to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise.  I can still save a significant amount of money compared to her initial offer, and it's likely that I won't be able to negotiate much further.  It's worth accepting the offer and securing the product."
