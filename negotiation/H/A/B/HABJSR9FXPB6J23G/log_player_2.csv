"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find very valuable. While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $1,400,000. This is a chance to secure something incredibly valuable at a price that's still very favorable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and hype the value, even though she knows her product is worth less to her ($1,200,000) than your absolute maximum ($1,500,000).  By rejecting her offer, you put yourself in a stronger negotiating position. You have a backup option (John) and Alice would lose the sale if you go with him."
