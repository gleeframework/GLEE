"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $150 is too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price or buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly lower than my actual maximum ($80). This leaves room for bargaining and gives Alice the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my range.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** By offering a much lower price, I can get a sense of how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she completely rejects this offer, it might indicate a tougher negotiation ahead. 

This counter-offer allows me to understand Alice's position better while still keeping the option of buying from John open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $110 is better than the initial offer, it's still significantly higher than both my target price ($60) and my maximum budget ($80).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from $150 to $110 indicates there's room for further negotiation. She might be willing to go lower if I hold firm. 
* **John's Offer:**  The safety net of John's $80 offer means I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with.

It's worth making another counteroffer closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  How about $70? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Budget:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from my previous offer but still keeps me below my maximum budget. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It's a good opportunity to see how Alice reacts to a price closer to my limit. Her response will dictate my next move. 
* **John's Offer Remains:**  I'm still mindful of John's offer. If Alice rejects this offer or doesn't budge much, I'm prepared to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's final offer of $95 is still above my maximum budget of $80. 
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Further:** Her statement ""that's as low as I'm willing to go"" suggests she won't budge any further. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John's standing offer of $80 is a better deal at this point, saving me $15.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take advantage of the guaranteed deal with John."
