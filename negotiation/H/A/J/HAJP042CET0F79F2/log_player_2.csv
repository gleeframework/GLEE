(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob is going to start with his maximum budget.  This is a bold move, but it sets a firm baseline and puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly to $13,500. This shows Alice he's willing to negotiate, but he's still holding firm on a price that's within his budget."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. The negotiations are going in the wrong direction.  Given the limited rounds and Alice's stubbornness, Bob is better off going with John's reliable offer.  While he doesn't get the best price, he secures the product within his budget."
