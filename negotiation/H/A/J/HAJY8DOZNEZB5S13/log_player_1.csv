Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  $100 is lower than your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $20 difference between your offer and Bob's value is a manageable gap for negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum value of $120. You can still potentially negotiate with Bob to get a higher price, and you should aim for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $95 is still higher than your minimum value of $120, ensuring you profit. 
* **It shows flexibility:**  You've adjusted your offer to show you're open to compromise.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product, as I think that's a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has offered $85, which is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $120 you can get from John. It's time to cut your losses and sell the product to John.  There's no guarantee that you can get a better price from Bob, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal with John entirely."
