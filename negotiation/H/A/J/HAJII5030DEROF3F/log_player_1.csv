Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering the product at $12,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. There's a risk Bob might reject it, but it's a calculated risk considering you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the price by emphasizing the product's value to Bob and the exclusive nature of the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
