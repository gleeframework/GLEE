Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and compromised on the price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can do $135 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and seems fixated on getting at least $135.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $120, our target price. We have a guaranteed option with John at $120, so it's time to cut our losses and buy from him."
