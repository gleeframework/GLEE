Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **Open to Offers:**  By saying I'm ""open to reasonable offers,"" I signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counteroffer and engage in a discussion.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $20,000 isn't an unreasonable starting point, especially if I believe the product could be worth more to Bob. This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately making him feel like the price is too high.

**Important Notes:**

* **Unknown Value:**  I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm taking a calculated risk. 
* **John's Offer:**  Remember, John is a fallback option for $15,000, so I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and represents a fair price for the value you'll be getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Reasoning:** My minimum is $15,000, so I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Language:** I'm using language like ""significant discount"" and ""fair price"" to emphasize the value of my offer while being respectful of Bob's budget.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to sell to John for $15,000 or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I don't want to risk going too much lower and potentially selling the product for less than it's worth to me. John is already offering a price that meets my minimum, so selling to John is the best course of action to ensure I receive a fair price."
