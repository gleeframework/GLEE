"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get a better deal than $12,000. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you are willing to pay up to $15,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate the price you've offered, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $12,000 and still within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. It's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
