"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
