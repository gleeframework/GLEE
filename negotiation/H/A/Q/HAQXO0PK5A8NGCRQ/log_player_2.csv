"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still within Bob's budget and significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000. It's a good deal for Bob, and there's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product altogether."
