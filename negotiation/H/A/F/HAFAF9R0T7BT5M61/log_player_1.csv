"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and creating a sense of urgency.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Remember:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This knowledge gives me leverage throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are 8 rounds left. I can counter with a price closer to my desired value and try to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John is a safety net:**  I know I can sell to John for $15,000, which gives me the leverage to be more assertive during the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum value.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially come up with a price that works for both of us. 

**Remember:**  I still have John as a backup option, which gives me a buffer and makes me less likely to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can do $9,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Progress in negotiation:**  Bob is getting closer to my desired price. With each round, the gap is narrowing.
* **Leverage with John:** I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me the power to hold out for a better deal.

I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our prices and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $9,800 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about $10,200? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between our last two offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a decent profit.
* **Urgency and finality:**  I'm using language like ""close this deal quickly"" to subtly pressure Bob into accepting.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Remember:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me the confidence to be firm but not overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. I can do $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Getting close:** The gap between our offers is narrowing, and we're nearing a potential deal.
* **Leverage with John:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, giving me the power to hold out for a better deal.

I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a very fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final, substantial compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Sense of Finality:**  I'm explicitly stating this is the best I can do, implying that if Bob doesn't accept, we might not reach a deal.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal and encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Remember:** I'm still comfortable with the option to sell to John for $15,000. This allows me to remain confident and assertive during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to save a bit of money. I can do $9,800, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalemated:** We're stuck at a price point that's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** Only two rounds left. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in this short time.
* **John Offers Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum target. 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating and try to squeeze out a little more from Bob, the risk of reaching a stalemate and ending up with nothing is too high. Selling to John ensures a positive outcome and avoids any further potential losses."
