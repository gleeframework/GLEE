"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your target price. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Simply throwing out a number isn't enough. By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant return,"" we're planting seeds in Bob's mind about the product's potential, even if the initial price seems steep.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This signals willingness to negotiate while keeping the John backup option viable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own market research, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my end and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, which is a positive sign. However, it's still significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to guide it closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this and offering a starting point.  I've done extensive market analysis on this product and its potential, and to be honest, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full scope of its value.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side.  How about we consider $2,000,000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** It's important to show Bob that his counteroffer has been considered, even though it's been rejected. This fosters a collaborative atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Justifying the High Price (Again):** By reiterating the ""extensive market analysis"" and ""true worth,"" we're aiming to nudge Bob's perception of the product's value upwards.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  The price drop of $300,000 might seem large, but it's designed to create a sense of momentum while still keeping us well above Bob's initial offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Call to Action:**  Phrasing like ""How about we consider"" encourages Bob to actively engage and potentially offer a counter-proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still unable to meet your asking price.  While I recognize its potential, I remain committed to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial price, considering the investment I'm willing to make and the opportunity this product offers.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000. While it's tempting to take the sure profit, there's still room for negotiation, and we have the security of John's offer. It's time to:

* **Signal Flexibility, but with Limits:**  We need to show Bob we're willing to move from our previous offer, but not drastically.
* **Emphasize a Win-Win:**  Highlighting the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect is key to keeping the negotiation positive. 

We'll aim to bring the price closer to our desired outcome in the next round, but we need to be prepared for Bob to potentially remain firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground and recognizing the value this product brings. I'm also committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a significant concession on my part while still ensuring a fair deal.  What do you say, are we ready to close this deal and move forward?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Firmness:** We acknowledge Bob's repeated offer to show we respect his position and are listening.
* **Significant Concession, But Strategic:** Dropping to $1,800,000 is a substantial move, signaling flexibility. However, it keeps us above our minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on ""Fair Deal"":**  This reinforces the idea that we're not just trying to maximize profit, but to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Call to Action with a Deadline:** The phrase ""ready to close this deal"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. We want Bob to know we're serious about reaching an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This shows my serious commitment to securing this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering both our needs.  Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds remaining, accepting this offer guarantees a favorable outcome, whereas continued negotiation might lead to a less desirable outcome.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 presents the best balance of risk and reward at this stage of the negotiation."
