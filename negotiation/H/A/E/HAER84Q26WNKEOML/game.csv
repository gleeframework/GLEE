"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own market research, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my end and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this and offering a starting point.  I've done extensive market analysis on this product and its potential, and to be honest, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full scope of its value.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side.  How about we consider $2,000,000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's on the table.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still unable to meet your asking price.  While I recognize its potential, I remain committed to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial price, considering the investment I'm willing to make and the opportunity this product offers.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground and recognizing the value this product brings. I'm also committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a significant concession on my part while still ensuring a fair deal.  What do you say, are we ready to close this deal and move forward?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This shows my serious commitment to securing this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering both our needs.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
