"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product is nice, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget. Starting with a low but not unreasonable counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite & Direct:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation, even when offering a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but room to negotiate:** Alice came down in price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $75 is still significantly higher than our target price.
* **Leverage:** We still have time and the option of John's offer.  Alice is more likely to move closer to our desired price as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That seems fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer suggests a compromise, which can be a persuasive tactic. It shows Alice we are willing to move towards her price, but still want a good deal. 
* **Closing the gap:** $70 is a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling we're serious about buying if the price is right. 
* **Maintaining politeness:** We continue to use a friendly and appreciative tone to encourage a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $72. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $72 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than John's offer and our maximum budget. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower, especially since she phrased this as her ""final concession."" Further negotiation might risk losing the deal. 
* **Time Value:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting a good deal now saves time and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement."
