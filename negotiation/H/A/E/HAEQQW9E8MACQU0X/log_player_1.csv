Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway; how about $1,000,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $950,000 is a significant profit and a good deal overall. It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's also the risk that Bob lowers his offer or walks away. Accepting now secures a strong return."
