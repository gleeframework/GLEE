Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly but firm. I highlight the product's value to Bob and frame the price as fair. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize my earnings:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible ($1,200,000).
* **Avoid a stalemate:** I want to avoid a situation where Bob rejects my offer and I'm forced to accept John's lower offer. 
* **Prepare for counteroffers:** I'm ready to negotiate and adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering your own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is still higher than John's, it's significantly lower than my desired price and my initial offer.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain a higher asking price and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay closer to my initial price, considering his perceived value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,150,000. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise to close the deal."
