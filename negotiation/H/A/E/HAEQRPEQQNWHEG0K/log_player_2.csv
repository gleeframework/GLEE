# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. My asking price is $1150000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You have a higher maximum price point than Alice's minimum price point, so there's a potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering your own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the product's value to you and my own valuation, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
