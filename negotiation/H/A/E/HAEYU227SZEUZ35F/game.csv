"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I really need to stay under that. Can we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
