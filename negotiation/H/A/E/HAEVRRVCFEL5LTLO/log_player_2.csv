Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $105? That's a firm offer from me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your limits, but $105 doesn't quite work for me. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $115.  This is a final offer from my end. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very firm on her price and unlikely to go below $115.  We have a guaranteed option with John at $100, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
