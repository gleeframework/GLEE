Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents a great value at this price point, though I understand you may need some time to consider. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I know John will buy the product for $15,000, there's a chance to get even closer to my $15,000 valuation with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but hesitant.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message is framed positively, highlighting ""opportunity"" and ""value"" to make the offer more enticing. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer, but it strategically positions me to potentially gain more than selling directly to John."
