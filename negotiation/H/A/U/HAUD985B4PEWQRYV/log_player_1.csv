``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob a reason to negotiate while still leaving room for you to make a profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $950,000, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is too low for you, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. It's tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, but with John's offer of $1,200,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John and secure the best possible price."
