"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at. This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for closer to his ideal price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer. He can continue to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a price closer to his target."
