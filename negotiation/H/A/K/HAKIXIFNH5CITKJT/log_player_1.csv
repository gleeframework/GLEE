Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects the offer, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my next offer accordingly.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible.  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is a good starting point for further negotiation.  I can use this to gauge his willingness to pay more.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John is a good backup option, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my minimum.  This will test Bob's commitment while giving me leverage. If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $90. This reflects the value I know you'll get from this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $95 to $90, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, aiming to appeal to his interest.
* **Open-ended:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter again if he's still not satisfied.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my profit margin above my minimum requirement. If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I can adjust my next offer based on his response, or fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit of $100, which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting an even lower offer.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of continued negotiation with him is too high. Selling to John guarantees a good return and minimizes the time and effort involved."
