{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate.  I'm asking $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to what I believe it's worth to Bob ($150), but I'm also being realistic and leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target of $130 or higher. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is more than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
