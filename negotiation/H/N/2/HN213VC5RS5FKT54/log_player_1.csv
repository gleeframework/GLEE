Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. I really like the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'm not sure I can stretch it to $18,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $14,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Although I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's final offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable threshold.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and saves me from further negotiation with Bob."
