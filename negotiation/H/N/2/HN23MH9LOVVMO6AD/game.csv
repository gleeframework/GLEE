"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,500.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $8,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I'm firm on $8,000 as my minimum. I believe the value of this product justifies that price, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you in the long run.  Are you willing to meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
