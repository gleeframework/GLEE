{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'd really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting my minimum acceptable value.  It also emphasizes the product's value to hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate.  I'm open to making counteroffers, but I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not pressured to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate and have a backup buyer in John.  I'll counteroffer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable value.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't let Bob take advantage of my fallback option with John. I'll try to meet him halfway again with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $130, so how about we try $132.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132.50 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value that I'm comfortable accepting it.  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John at a lower profit.  This is a good outcome, and I can still earn a reasonable amount."
