"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not willing to go above $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $15,000, but that's my final offer",15000.0,Bob,4,
