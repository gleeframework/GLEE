Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up this offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I understand you're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to sacrifice too much profit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $815,000. This is the final concession I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to take the deal.  Alice has drawn a firm line, and while we could try to haggle further, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $815,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
