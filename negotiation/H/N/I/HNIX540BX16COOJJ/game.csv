"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I understand you're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to sacrifice too much profit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,
