"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm confident you'll see the significant value this product brings.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still save $50,000 by rejecting her offer and negotiating with John. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create leverage and can potentially negotiate a lower price with John."
