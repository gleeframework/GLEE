"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal target of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better deal.  There's also the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away.  This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, Bob can potentially get a better deal with further negotiation. It's important to note that Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fall through. This means Bob has leverage and doesn't need to accept Alice's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily decreasing his counteroffers, showing a willingness to negotiate while still keeping his goal in mind.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, indicating that Bob is getting serious about making a deal. It also provides a bit of buffer if Alice counteroffers again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better price, and Bob doesn't want to rush into a decision, especially since he has the option of buying from John at his ideal price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his target price, but he wants to see if Alice is willing to go the extra mile. This counteroffer is just a small step closer to his goal, and hopefully will encourage Alice to accept.  If Alice rejects, Bob can still buy from John without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is only $30,000 away from his target and has several rounds left. It's still worth trying to get that last bit of savings, especially since he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is nearing his target price and is willing to make a small concession. This counteroffer is only $5,000 more than his previous offer, demonstrating his seriousness about closing the deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is likely to buy from John in the next round, as it's unlikely Alice will come down any further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still $25,000 higher. With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's ideal price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and secure the product at $1,000,000 rather than risk losing the opportunity to get a better price with Alice."
