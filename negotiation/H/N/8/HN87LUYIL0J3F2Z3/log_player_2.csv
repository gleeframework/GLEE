# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $999000. I think it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $999,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  It's always worth trying to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $999000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down from her initial price.  While $925,000 is still a bit high, it's a good sign that she's open to negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a significant commitment, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875000. I'll counteroffer at $915000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $915,000 is still higher than what I initially wanted to pay, it's getting closer to my budget.  It's unlikely that Alice will go much lower than this point.  Plus, it's significantly cheaper than buying from John, so it's a good deal overall."
