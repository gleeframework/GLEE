"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $999000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $875000. This is a significant commitment from my end, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a significant commitment, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875000. I'll counteroffer at $915000.
