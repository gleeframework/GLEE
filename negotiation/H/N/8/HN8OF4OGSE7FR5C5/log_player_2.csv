"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $9,000 is less than $12,000, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price point of $8,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9,100. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected several offers and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. This offer is closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,750. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John's offer, while still making a profit from the product's value to him.  Further negotiation could continue, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
