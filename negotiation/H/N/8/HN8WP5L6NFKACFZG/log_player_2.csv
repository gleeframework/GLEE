**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
*  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
