# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price. It's better to reject the offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,290,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  While it's only slightly higher, Bob is now within range to purchase the product from John for a lower price. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's more advantageous to buy from John in this round."
