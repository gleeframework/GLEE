"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to entice Bob with a good deal while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the deal and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. It's still within your range and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to accept $100 and secure a profit."
