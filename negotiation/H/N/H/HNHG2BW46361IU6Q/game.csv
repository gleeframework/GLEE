"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $8,500? That would be a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant price difference, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $7,000 is definitely a better offer than your previous one.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 to make this work. This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
