"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still think the price is too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",825000.0,Bob,4,
