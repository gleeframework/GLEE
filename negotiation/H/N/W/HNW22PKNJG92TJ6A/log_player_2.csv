It's always worth trying to negotiate.  There's room for improvement on the price, and we can see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to our desired price, there's still room for negotiation. We'll try to meet somewhere in the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice's offer is pretty close to our desired price and further negotiation may not yield significant savings. It's better to accept and avoid the risk of Alice walking away or us ending up paying more to John."
