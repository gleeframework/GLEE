"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible and his maximum budget is $12,000. It's better to reject and counteroffer to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Let me see what I can do. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, so it's better to reject and continue negotiating. There's still room for a better deal, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high. My maximum budget is $12,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. Let me think for a moment... How about I meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500? I can offer you $12,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  He can buy the product from John for $12,000, so it makes sense to reject this offer and try to get closer to his target price. There are still a few rounds remaining to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get the best price for your product, but $12,750 is just outside my budget. I'm happy to go up to $12,250.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,250. Let me think... I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $12,800? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He has the option of buying from John for $12,000, which is the best price he can get at this point.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will be willing to go lower than $12,800.  Therefore, Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
