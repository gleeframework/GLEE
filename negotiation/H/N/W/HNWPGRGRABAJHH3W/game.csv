"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no more than $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is no less than $1500000. I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is no less than $1500000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
