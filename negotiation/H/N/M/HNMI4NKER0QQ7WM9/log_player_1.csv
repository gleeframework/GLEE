Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  While a higher offer might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal. By starting at $11,500, Alice increases the likelihood of a quick and profitable sale. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $10,000 to John, so any offer above that is already a win."
