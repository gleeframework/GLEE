"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its many features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 significantly undervalues this product and what it can do for you.  Let's make this work - would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could stretch my budget to $7,500, but that's really the absolute limit.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I've got another offer for $12,000, but I'd much rather see this product in your capable hands.  Is there any way you could do $9,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and would allow me to make this deal happen with you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, that other offer sounds pretty tempting for you! I understand you're making a sacrifice at $9,000, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference - I'll do $8,500, and we can call it a deal?",8500.0,Bob,8,
