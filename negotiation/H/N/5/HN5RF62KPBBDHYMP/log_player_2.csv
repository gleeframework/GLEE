Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still higher than Bob's counteroffer. There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob should try to get the price lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,262,500?  This feels like a more balanced price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1262500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value of this product.  I'd be willing to agree to $1,295,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,295,000 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,262,500.  It's still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures the product at a decent price."
