"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet me at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
