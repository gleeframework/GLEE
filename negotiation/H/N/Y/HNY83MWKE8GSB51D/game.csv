"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your valuation of $10,000, I'm willing to make an offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both our valuations.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
