Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. I'm offering $13,500, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if further negotiations will get me closer to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
