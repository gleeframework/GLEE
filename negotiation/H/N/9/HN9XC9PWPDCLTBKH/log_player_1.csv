Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its unique benefits. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to open a dialogue and understand Bob's perspective. This can help gauge his willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** If Bob counters with a price significantly lower than $950,000, I (Alice) will likely decline and proceed to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
