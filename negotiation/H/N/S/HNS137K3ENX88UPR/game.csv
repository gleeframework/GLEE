,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable at this price.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $88.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $90? This would give us both a fair price, and I can assure you this product is worth every penny. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
