{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100. This is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation of $80 but lower than my minimum valuation of $120.  
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I am trying to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a potential sale. If Bob rejects, I will consider his counteroffer and potentially lower my price further to reach an agreement, but I will not go below my minimum valuation of $120. I am also keeping the option to sell to John for $120 open, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $120. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not financially advantageous for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with a $35 profit margin, which is significantly lower than the $120 profit I could make by selling to John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $85 is a low offer, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I am not desperate for a sale at this price and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground where we can both agree.  I will also keep the option to sell to John open, which provides me with a safety net in case the negotiations fail."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable at this price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $92.50, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of him accepting.  However, $92.50 is still above my minimum valuation of $120, ensuring I don't lose out financially. I am also keeping the option to sell to John open as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $88.5 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below my target profit margin. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a profit of $8.5, which is significantly less than the $120 profit I could make by selling to John.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground where we can both agree. I will also keep the option to sell to John open as a fallback option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $88.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $90? This would give us both a fair price, and I can assure you this product is worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $90, which is slightly higher than Bob's offer of $88.5 but still significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $120.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of the offer.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself.  I'm confident that $90 is a fair price that Bob is likely to accept, especially considering the value of the product. If he rejects this offer, I will consider selling to John for $120."
