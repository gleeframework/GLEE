"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,750 is significantly lower than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **Negotiation is likely to be time-consuming:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go much lower.  
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and Bob might end up paying more in the long run.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
