Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I ask ""What do you think?"" to invite Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price by counteroffering.  

I'm not immediately selling to John because I still have a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $75 is a good deal for you, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $85?  It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $85, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob of its quality and potential benefits.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a breakdown.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I don't sell below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my absolute limit, and I'd be happy to buy it then. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. 

* **Reaching Minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product at the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a stalemate.  
* **Guarantee Sale:** Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out entirely or the potential of John not wanting the product after all.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
