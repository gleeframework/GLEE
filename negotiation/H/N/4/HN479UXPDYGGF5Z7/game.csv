"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $75 is a good deal for you, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $85?  It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my absolute limit, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",80.0,Bob,4,
