"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $18,000 on it. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget, around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I still believe that $14,000 is slightly above my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $12,000? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price point?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and while I understand your position, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'd like to propose $12,500 as a compromise. I hope this is within the range you're considering.",12500.0,Bob,6,
