Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal.  I will try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1300000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,300,000 is still below my preferred range.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a higher price.  I will try to counteroffer Bob again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $1,300,000. How about we split the difference again and go with $1,325,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more offer: $1280000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I've already rejected two of his counteroffers and I have 4 more rounds to negotiate. There is still a good chance that I can secure a better price with Bob. If I am unable to get a better offer, I can always sell the product to John for $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more offer: $1250000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would like to get more for the product, Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. With only two rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better offer from Bob is low.  It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John to avoid risking losing the opportunity altogether."
