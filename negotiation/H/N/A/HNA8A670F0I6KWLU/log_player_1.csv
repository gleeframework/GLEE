"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price from him or John.  I'll try to counter-offer him and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $9,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to counter-offer him one more time, and if that doesn't work, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,150? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway again, but $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $9,900. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but it's taking a lot of back and forth, and we're running out of time.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome given the current situation."
