"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $9,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,150? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10150.0,Alice,5,
