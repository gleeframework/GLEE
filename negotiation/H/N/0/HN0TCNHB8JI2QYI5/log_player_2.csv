"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $200 is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the better deal."
