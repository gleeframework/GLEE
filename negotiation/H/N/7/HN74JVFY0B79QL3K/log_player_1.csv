"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still above my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm only four rounds into the process, and there is still room for compromise. I'm also considering the fact that Bob is showing interest in the product and actively negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $890,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only four rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  Bob has made it clear that $880,000 is his final offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and well above my minimum. There's a risk that if I reject this offer, he might walk away, leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for a lower price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
