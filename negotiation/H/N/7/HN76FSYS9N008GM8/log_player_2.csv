"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I can do $92, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. While $92.50 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit higher than you'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $91.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle. I appreciate the effort. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think $92 is the minimum I can accept. How about we meet at $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've been able to negotiate the price down to $92, which is a good price considering your goal was to spend no more than $100.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice will walk away, and you'll end up paying more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $92 is the most financially sound decision."
