"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth starting negotiations and seeing if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given my valuation and your stated worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still higher than my maximum of $12,000. I'll keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still beyond what I can pay. Let's try $13,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and it's closer to your value.  I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
