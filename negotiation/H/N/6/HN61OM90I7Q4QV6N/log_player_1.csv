"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob,  I'm starting significantly higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential""  to justify the high initial price, without revealing my absolute bottom line. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer in mind gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and even his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still 8 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Leverage:** I have a standing offer from John, which allows me to be more firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to move this negotiation forward.  This offer reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate while still remaining well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the ""market value"" and the ""true value and potential"" to justify the still-high price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping too low too quickly, as I want to see how much Bob is willing to move and maintain my leverage with John's offer in my back pocket."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a middle ground here. I understand the product's value, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value but is still below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Positive Signals:**  His willingness to increase his offer significantly suggests he's really interested and there's room for a deal. 
* **Time for Strategy:** I need to counter with a price that brings him closer while making it clear I'm not settling for anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a substantial decrease to signal flexibility but setting a clear boundary. 
* **Introducing Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning another buyer (without revealing John's offer) creates a sense of urgency and limited opportunity for Bob.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  This can sometimes push hesitant buyers to be more realistic or reveal their true willingness to pay. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Bob walks away, but with John's offer as backup, I'm willing to take this calculated risk to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,400,000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering your need to make a decision soon, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also evaluating other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Limit:** Bob has reached his perceived value of the product. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  His mirroring of the ""final offer"" suggests he's serious and may walk away.
* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,000,000 is still a significant profit. Continuing to push risks losing both Bob and potentially leaving money on the table compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and allows me to re-invest or utilize the earnings sooner."
