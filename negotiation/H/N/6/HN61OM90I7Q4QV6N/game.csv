"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to move this negotiation forward.  This offer reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find a middle ground here. I understand the product's value, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,400,000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering your need to make a decision soon, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also evaluating other options. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
