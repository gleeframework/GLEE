"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit while acknowledging the value to Bob.  This gives us room to negotiate and allows Bob to counteroffer.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can then adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  We have 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable position.  It's a calculated risk â€“ Bob might reject it, but it's worth seeing if he's willing to budge further. We have 7 rounds left."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. We have 6 rounds left, and there's still time to get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm also trying to gauge Bob's maximum price. I'm going to see if he's willing to move closer to $1,000,000.  We have 5 rounds left, and it's time to start getting serious about closing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. We have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident that with persistent negotiation, I can achieve a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum, and with only 3 rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close the deal. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the same price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. I've tried to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the best possible price for the product."
