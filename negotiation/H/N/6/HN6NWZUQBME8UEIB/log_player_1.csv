Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, starting higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, I still sell the product at its base value.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.
* Bob's negotiation skills and willingness to pay above market value are unknown factors."
