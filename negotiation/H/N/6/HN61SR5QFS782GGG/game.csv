"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my best offer - I'm not sure I can go lower. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering your willingness to come down to $9,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500.  However, I'm still closer to $9,000.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $8,750. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
