"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
