"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
