Bob should reject Alice's offer because it's higher than his maximum budget.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, even at the halfway point. It is in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000."
