Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. Offering it at a significantly higher price tests his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message aims to justify the high price by highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product. This framing can make Bob feel like he's making a strategic investment. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. You can always negotiate with Bob if he rejects this price. Having John as a backup buyer gives you strong leverage."
