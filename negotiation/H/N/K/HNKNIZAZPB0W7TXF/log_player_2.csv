"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us and the potential for a quick sale. Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price. If you reject the offer, you can make another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further."
