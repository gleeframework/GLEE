"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it immediately.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
