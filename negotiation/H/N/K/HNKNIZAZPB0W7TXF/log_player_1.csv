{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price, making it appealing to Bob. However, it still leaves room for negotiation, allowing you to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price. There's potential to get closer to your desired value by negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us and the potential for a quick sale. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is still a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price, it's a good compromise considering Bob's willingness to pay and the potential for a quick sale.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away entirely, and you're already above your minimum acceptable price."
