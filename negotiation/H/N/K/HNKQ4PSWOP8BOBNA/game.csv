"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, $7,750 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
