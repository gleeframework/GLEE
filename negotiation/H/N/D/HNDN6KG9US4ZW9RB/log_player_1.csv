Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the product's value to Bob, increasing his potential interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer doesn't immediately push Bob to John. If Bob counteroffers, I can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject his offer and try to negotiate further, I risk him walking away or me ending up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale close to my minimum, and I can move on to other potential opportunities."
