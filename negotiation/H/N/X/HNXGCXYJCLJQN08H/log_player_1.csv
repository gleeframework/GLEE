"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible, while leaving room for Bob to feel he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's valuation, but shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept while still getting a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can nudge him a bit closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise, getting closer to Bob's valuation and leaving less room for further negotiation. However, I'm hoping this is the sweet spot to get Bob to accept while still getting a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum value, and I'm getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's becoming increasingly unlikely I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm running the risk of losing the deal altogether.  

To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000."
