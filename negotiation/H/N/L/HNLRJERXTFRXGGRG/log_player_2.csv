"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to us. Considering its value and quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. I believe this price reflects its worth while also allowing you to enjoy a reasonable discount. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the discount,  $110 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I'm looking for."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A large counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us space to gradually increase our price over the remaining rounds. 
* **Aim for a significant discount:** Our goal is to save as much money as possible, so we're aiming for a price well below our $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I'd like to offer the product to you for $90. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable discount for you. I hope this proposal suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming to get closer to $85. Let's see if we can meet in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 87.50
}
```

We're proposing a compromise that splits the difference between Alice's current offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows Alice we are willing to move, but still holds firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a fair compromise, I would like to propose a price of $92.5 for the product. I believe this price respects both our positions and I hope it aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close to our limit, but it's worth one more try to see if Alice will come down further. We're still in a good position to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're clearly invested in finding a fair deal, and I respect that.  $90 seems like the sweet spot for me.  If you're willing to come down slightly, I'm ready to agree."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Matching Alice's previous offer:**  By offering $90, we're meeting her at her previous price point.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but polite language:**  We're reiterating our position that $90 is our limit, but doing so politely and respectfully. 
* **Sense of urgency:** The phrase ""ready to agree"" implies that we're close to a deal, which could encourage Alice to accept. 

If Alice rejects this offer, we'll likely switch to buying from John in the next round."
