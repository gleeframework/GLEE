Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also establishes a perceived higher value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys value and doesn't sound desperate, increasing the chance Bob will consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming too high might make Bob walk away immediately. It's a balancing act between ambition and realism."
