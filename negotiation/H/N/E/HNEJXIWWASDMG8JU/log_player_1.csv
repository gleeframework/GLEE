Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. This is my maximum offer, as I have another option available at this price.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
