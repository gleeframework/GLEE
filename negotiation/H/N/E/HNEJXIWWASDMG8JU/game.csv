"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. This is my maximum offer, as I have another option available at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1500000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1500000 is still outside my comfortable range. Given my budget and the other offer I have, I'm unfortunately unable to go higher than $1250000.  If this is acceptable, we can finalize the deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might have to consider other offers, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is just $50000 above your latest offer. This is my final compromise. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
