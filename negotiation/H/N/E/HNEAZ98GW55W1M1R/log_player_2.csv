# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. My asking price is $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's best to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own costs, I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still allow for a reasonable profit for me and hopefully remains attractive to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

``` 

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100. You can try to negotiate further, but it's getting risky as you could end up paying more than you want."
