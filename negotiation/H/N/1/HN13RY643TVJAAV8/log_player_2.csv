"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,500, it's a good deal. Accepting her offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
