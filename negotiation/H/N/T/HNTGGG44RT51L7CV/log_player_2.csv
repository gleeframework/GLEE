"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's in your best interest to reject and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000?  This reflects some flexibility on my end while still recognizing the value this brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
