"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a great deal while still ensuring I get a fair return.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly wants to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $12,000."
