"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A $12,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets a clear expectation.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While Bob is trying to get a good price, this offer is still above the product's value to Alice.  This increases the chance of Alice accepting, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13000? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, exactly in the middle of Bob's counteroffer ($12,000) and her previous offer ($14,000).
* **Time is Money:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or the negotiation could drag on.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good price without wasting valuable time.
* **Good Deal:** $13,000 is still significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, securing a good deal and saving $2,000."
