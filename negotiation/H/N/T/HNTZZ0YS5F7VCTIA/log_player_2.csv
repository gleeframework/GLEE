"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price. He should keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach. How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's getting closer, $10,200 is still above his budget and he's already close to his limit of 10 rounds. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price before potentially losing the chance to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,200 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,750, which would be $9,975. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,975. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,975
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation with Alice and he's getting close to his limit of 10 rounds. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still not within his ideal range, and he risks not being able to get the product at all if he keeps rejecting. It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price, even if it's not ideal."
