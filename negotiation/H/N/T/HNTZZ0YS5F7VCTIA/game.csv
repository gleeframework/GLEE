"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach. How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,200 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,750, which would be $9,975. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",9975.0,Alice,7,
