"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $95.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a great deal for both of us. It's the highest price I'm willing to consider.",105.0,Alice,5,
