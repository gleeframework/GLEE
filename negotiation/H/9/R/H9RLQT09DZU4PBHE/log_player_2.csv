"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still more than Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value. It shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a margin for further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000 and still provides a good margin for Bob.  There's a chance to negotiate further, but accepting at this point minimizes risk and saves a considerable amount of money."
