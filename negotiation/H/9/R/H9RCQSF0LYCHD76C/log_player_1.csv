Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 to match John's offer, there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a price point that suggests a good deal to Bob (saving him $5) while still being significantly higher than his perceived value ($100). This increases the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate acknowledges that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I secure a sale quickly instead of waiting for John."
