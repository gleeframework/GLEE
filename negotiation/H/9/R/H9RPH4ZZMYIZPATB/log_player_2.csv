"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90, which is more than your maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting her offer makes sense. You can then buy the product from John for your desired price."
