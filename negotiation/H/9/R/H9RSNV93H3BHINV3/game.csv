"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's above what I'm willing to pay. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is still a significant investment for me, but it's closer to what I believe the product is worth to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
