"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also sets a strong initial price point, leaving room for me to lower it slightly in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure the deal now than to risk a lengthy negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
