"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $800000, my maximum price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price, given my budget constraints and the potential value of the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go up to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I'm confident that this product has value, but I need to stay within my budget to make it work.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit, but I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is a serious offer, and I truly believe this product is worth it. Let's close this deal now!",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I believe this is the minimum price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a final offer at this price. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
