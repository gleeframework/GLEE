Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a starting point.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a better deal than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that by making a counteroffer, I can demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and get closer to a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd prefer, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's also likely that if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, Bob will either reject it or offer a price even lower than $10,000. Accepting his offer ensures I sell the product and get a decent profit, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
