"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about $105? I'm still willing to negotiate a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $100. This is my final offer, as I can buy it elsewhere for that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
