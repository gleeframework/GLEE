"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob's value is unknown. This allows room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my ideal price. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $1,200,000.  I've already had two rounds of negotiation and haven't gotten closer to my ideal price.  It's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge further.  Selling to John for the same amount means no risk and a quicker transaction, but I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
