"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a deal for $1,090,000. This is the best I can do, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
