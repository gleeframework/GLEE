Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your guaranteed sale allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your guaranteed sale, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a significant profit, exceeding your minimum by a large margin.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to lower the price, potentially still exceeding your $1,500,000 guarantee.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John, securing your guaranteed sale price."
