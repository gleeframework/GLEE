Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Backup Offer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning ""value"" might pique Bob's interest and make him curious to learn more. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be better. 
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is highly unique and desirable, a higher price might be justifiable."
