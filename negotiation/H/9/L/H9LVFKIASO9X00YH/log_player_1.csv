Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer without you having to immediately accept a lower price.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $115 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to accept.

This strategy aims to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $110 is only $5 less than your initial offer, and it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and secures a good price. While you could try to counteroffer, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk delaying the sale."
