"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, it seems we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
