Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know if this works for you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While $1,200,000 is a reasonable discount from her initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a price that's better than John's. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
