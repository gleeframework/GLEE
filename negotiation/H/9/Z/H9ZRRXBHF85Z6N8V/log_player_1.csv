Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $15,900 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible price. While we could continue negotiating, accepting his offer of $15,900 is a solid profit above our minimum. Continuing to push could backfire, leaving us with a less desirable outcome.  It's always good to leave a little ""win"" for the buyer, and this price accomplishes that."
