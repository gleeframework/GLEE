"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to You:** The product is worth $120 to you, so you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering $110, which is a good starting point, but you want to see if you can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** You want to get the product as close to your $120 limit as possible, but you're also trying to be fair to Alice.
* **Counteroffer:** Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Building Rapport:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product while politely suggesting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
