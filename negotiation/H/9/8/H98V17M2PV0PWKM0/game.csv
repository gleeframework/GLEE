,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8200 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise at $8400. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my desired value. What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,5,
