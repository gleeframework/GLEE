"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize this quickly.",105.0,Bob,4,
