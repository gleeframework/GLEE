Alice's offer:

Let's analyze why:

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** She's already come down from $90 to $72.  While she might budge a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant drop.
* **Time and effort:**  Each round of negotiation takes time.  Getting the product for $72 is a good deal and saves you the hassle of further back-and-forth.
* **John's price is higher:** Buying from John means paying $80. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $8.

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the time spent negotiating."
