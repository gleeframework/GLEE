Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, creating room for negotiation.
    *  Lower than my guaranteed sale price, ensuring I still make a substantial profit if Bob accepts.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and positioning the offer as beneficial for Bob."
