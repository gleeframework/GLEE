"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
