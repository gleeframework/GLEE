"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point, aiming for a profit while still being within Bob's likely range.  I'll see how he reacts before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $9,000, I'm holding out for more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his last offer. I'm hoping this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low. I'm not going to settle for less than $10,000, especially since John is willing to pay that much. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $10,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  It's a good price for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price. While I'd like to make more, I'm satisfied with securing the $10,000.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's time to close this deal."
