Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, as I want to maximize my earnings without risking a lost sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $100 I can get from John.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can likely get him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Risk mitigation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean I lose the sale. I can continue negotiating with him or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within acceptable range:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This can help Bob feel more comfortable accepting.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  While I'm willing to come down from my initial price, I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's unlikely I can get him to go much higher. 
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, and I'm guaranteed to sell the product to him. 
* **Minimizing risk:** By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price or a lost sale."
