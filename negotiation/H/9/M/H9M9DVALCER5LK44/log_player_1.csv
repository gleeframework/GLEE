I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000.  This is the price I would get from John if Bob rejects the offer.  While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's no harm in offering my minimum acceptable price. It's possible he might be willing to pay more to secure the product, and this approach gives me the best chance of getting the highest possible price."
