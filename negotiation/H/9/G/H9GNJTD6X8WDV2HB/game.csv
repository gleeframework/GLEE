"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
