{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as much as possible from Bob, but I'm also aware of the potential of John's offer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? It's still a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,250. This is my final offer as I am not able to pay more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as further negotiation might not yield a better result, and the risk of rejecting and selling to John for $12,000 is not worth it."
