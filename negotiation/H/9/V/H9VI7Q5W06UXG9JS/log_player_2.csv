"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's no rush to accept the first offer, especially since you have an alternative option. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you control.** You can set the terms of the counteroffer and potentially drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By starting with a lower counteroffer, you show Alice you're serious about negotiating while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** The $10,500 price is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, highlighting your willingness to save money. 
* **Maintaining Options:**  The counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get even closer to your desired price without immediately resorting to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save a bit more, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better, but still leaves room for improvement.**  You're closer to your goal price of $10,500, but you can likely still negotiate a better price.
* **You have 7 rounds left.** There's still time to try and get a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows for continued negotiation.**  You can counteroffer again, potentially narrowing the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $10,650. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** We're using a ""split the difference"" tactic. It shows Alice we're willing to compromise, while still getting closer to our desired price. 
* **Value Proposition:**  $10,650 is a fair price for both of us. You save money, and Alice gets a sale closer to her desired price. 
* **Progress:** This counteroffer continues to demonstrate your serious commitment to negotiating a fair price, without rushing to accept or abandon the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,750. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target Price:**  Alice's offer of $10,750 is very close to your target price of $10,500. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers and potentially miss out on a good deal. 
* **Potential for Stalemate:** If you continue to reject, Alice might become less willing to compromise.
* **Risk of Buying from John:**  Although John offers a guaranteed price, it's $250 more than Alice's current offer.  

Accepting Alice's offer at this point is a good compromise that gets you a fair price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John or potentially reaching a stalemate."
