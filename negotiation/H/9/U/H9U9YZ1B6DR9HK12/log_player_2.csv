"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, for a price that I believe is a fair reflection of its value.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to acquire something truly special. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum price and John offers the product for less. It makes the most sense to buy from John in this scenario."
