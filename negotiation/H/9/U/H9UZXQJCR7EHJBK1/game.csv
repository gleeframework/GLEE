"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I value finding common ground, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to move down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
