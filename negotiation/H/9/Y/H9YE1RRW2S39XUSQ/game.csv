"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's split the difference and make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm thinking $1,025,000. Can we make it work at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
