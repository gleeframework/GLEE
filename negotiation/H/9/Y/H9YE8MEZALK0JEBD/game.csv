"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still aiming for my initial offer of $800,000. It's the highest I can go, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $800,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still committed to my offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'm ready to purchase the product from John for that price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
