Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $17,000 is a fair price. I've done some research and I think the market value of this product is lower than you're letting on. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, so I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while we could negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of him dropping his offer further. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price."
