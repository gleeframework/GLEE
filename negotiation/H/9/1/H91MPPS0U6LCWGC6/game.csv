"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $17,000 is a fair price. I've done some research and I think the market value of this product is lower than you're letting on. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, so I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
