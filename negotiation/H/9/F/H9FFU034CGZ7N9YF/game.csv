"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  This reflects a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1200000,  reflecting a compromise on my end. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
