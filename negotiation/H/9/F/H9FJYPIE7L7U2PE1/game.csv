"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and above my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? It's a fair price that would benefit us both.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $7,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
