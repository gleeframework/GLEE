"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $1,100,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget. He has a better option with John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're working towards a price that works for you.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business, and I believe this price reflects that.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, which is still higher than Bob's budget. At this point, Bob has a better option with John, who is selling the same product for $1,000,000. It's more advantageous to buy from John and secure the product at a lower price, rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
