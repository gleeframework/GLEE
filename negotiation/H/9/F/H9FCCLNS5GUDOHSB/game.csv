"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $15000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  It's a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of this item. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your value in the product, and $13500 is a fair price. However, I'm still a bit stretched at that point.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would allow me to secure the product within my budget and hopefully, we can both be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $13000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit off on the price. How about $13250? It's a small step closer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let's close the deal and make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,5,
