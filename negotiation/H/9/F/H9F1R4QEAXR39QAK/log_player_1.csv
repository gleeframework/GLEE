{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation for Bob. 
* **It's direct:** It clearly states the price you're looking for, eliminating any ambiguity. 
* **It's friendly:**  It starts the conversation on a positive note, making Bob more likely to engage. 

By starting with this offer, you've positioned yourself well to maximize your profit while leaving the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can still do better.  There is a significant gap between what Bob is willing to pay and the product's value to him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to explore a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and also shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on a price that's significantly better than Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Justification:**  The message highlights the value of the product, justifying the price and making it clear that you're not just throwing out a random number.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

By taking this approach, you're increasing your chances of securing a deal closer to your desired price while still maintaining a positive and professional relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still working within my budget constraints and would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have a choice to make: accept his offer and secure a quick sale, or reject and try to push for a higher price. 

**Reason for Rejecting:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can secure a price closer to your target with another counteroffer.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While $8,500 is more than selling to John, it's still less than your desired profit margin.  Rejecting allows you to potentially maximize your earnings.

**Next Steps:**

It's time to counter with a new offer that bridges the gap between your price and Bob's. Consider offering a price closer to your target but still leaving room for further negotiation."
