{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $100 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay. Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than its worth to me. Selling to John ensures I get the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
