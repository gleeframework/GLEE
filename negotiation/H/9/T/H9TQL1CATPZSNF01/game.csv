"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I've been looking at similar products and I think that's a fair price for this one.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $20,000 is closer to its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $13,500. How about we settle at $15,500? This offer reflects my bottom line.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which would be $13,500. I'm willing to go up to this price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher.",13500.0,Bob,6,
