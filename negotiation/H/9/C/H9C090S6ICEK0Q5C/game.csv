"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we start at $1000000? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $1100000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
