"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,050,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $1,015,000? It's a good price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
