I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price! Would you like to buy it from me for $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and go for $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50?",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $142.50 is a bit too high for me. Let's try $140. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $145. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $143.50?",143.5,Alice,5,
