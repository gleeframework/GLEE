Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making him think about its potential benefits. 
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting it's a ""significant opportunity,"" implying that if he doesn't act quickly, he might miss out.

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, I get a good price.
2. **Initiate negotiations:** If he rejects, I can get a sense of his perceived value and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. 
3. **Maintain leverage:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in it, my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1200000? I believe this might be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer more, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  The potential of further negotiation is too risky, as it could lead to a lower price or a delay in the sale, potentially causing me to lose the opportunity to sell to John."
