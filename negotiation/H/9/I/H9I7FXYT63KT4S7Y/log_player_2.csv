"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $105?  That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $108. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still within your budget, and you've already rejected her previous offer, making her more likely to compromise. It's a good deal for you, as you're only paying $8 over your maximum. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John, or having the negotiation drag on, outweighs the potential savings of a few more dollars."
