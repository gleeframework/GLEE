"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate down without going below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob to create a positive initial impression. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  My starting price leaves room for both of us to find a compromise within the 10 rounds. 
* **The John Option:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which helps me decide if any counteroffers are worth pursuing or if I should just go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal target. I have 8 rounds left and the potential to get closer to my ideal value.
* **The John Option:** The $1,000,000 from John is still a safe backup, but I'm not desperate yet.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. I can use the next round to make a counteroffer that brings Bob closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  I can come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the immense value you'll gain from this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get, aiming to convince him that the price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation productive.
* **Strategic Drop:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum of $1,000,000 but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **The John Option:**  If Bob rejects this, I'm still in a good position to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I have 6 rounds left.
* **The John Option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me a strong fallback option.
* **Potential for More:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him higher.  A final offer from Bob could indicate he's serious about making a deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Continuing the negotiation gives me a chance to potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

In round 5, I'll likely make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $975,000. This would signal that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to maximize my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I'm confident you'll find the product a valuable asset. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $975,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** It's closer to Bob's offer, signaling I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and cooperative tone emphasizes my desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **The John Option:** I'm still aware of the $1,000,000 offer from John, which provides a safety net if this negotiation falls through.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure for a quick resolution.

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess the situation in the next round.  I might need to make a final concession to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and my original offer of $900,000, so I'm offering $937,500 for the product. This is my next best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:**  $937,500 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I have 4 rounds remaining.
* **The John Option:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me a strong fallback option.
* **Potential for More:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him higher. Bob might be willing to increase his offer to secure the deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Continuing the negotiation gives me a chance to potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In round 7, I'll likely make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $950,000. This would signal that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $962,500. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while respecting your budget. We're so close to an agreement; let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 962500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $962,500 is a small increase from Bob's last offer, signaling my willingness to compromise but still aiming to reach a higher price point.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer narrows the gap between our positions, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the urgency of closing the deal with phrases like ""We're so close to an agreement"" to push for a resolution.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value, aiming to convince him that the price is justified.
* **The John Option:**  I'm aware of the $1,000,000 offer from John, providing a safety net if the negotiation fails.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make a final concession or sell to John in the next round. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a favorable price, even though it's not my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make this deal work for you, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds left, the pressure to close the deal is high.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob is firm on his offer of $950,000, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **The John Option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a higher price and a certain outcome.  The potential of losing another round and still ending up with $950,000 from Bob isn't worth the risk. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to earn more, selling to John is the safest and most profitable option in this situation.  There's a good chance that Bob won't increase his offer, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 than risk a lower price or a failed negotiation."
