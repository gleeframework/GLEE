Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $135 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **The ""Special Offer"" Tactic:**  Framing the price as a ""special"" or limited-time deal can make it more enticing.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, ensuring we don't lose out."
