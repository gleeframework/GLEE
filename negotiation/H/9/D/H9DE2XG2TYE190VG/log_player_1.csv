Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than his offer, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 81} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk going through another round of negotiation.  While I would prefer to earn more, selling to John for $80 ensures I get a price that is at least my minimum, and avoids further potential losses in the negotiation with Bob."
