"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I'll get a good return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $850,000?  This would still give you a healthy profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get a fairer return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up buying from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars."
