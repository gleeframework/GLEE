"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
