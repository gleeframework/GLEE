"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
