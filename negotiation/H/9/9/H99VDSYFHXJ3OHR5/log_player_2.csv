"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further as she values the product at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, knowing that Alice's minimum acceptable price is $10,000. Offering $10,500 starts the negotiation strong while leaving some room for compromise. This counteroffer is a fair starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer, it's still lower than John's price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further, as she's already lowered her price from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, aiming for a compromise.  $11,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is serious about purchasing but still expects a significant discount. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while keeping his goal of saving as much money as possible in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $13,000 is now significantly closer to his maximum budget of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price he can afford and allows him to avoid the risk of Alice walking away."
