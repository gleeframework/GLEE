Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $200,000 markup allows for some negotiation without jeopardizing my desired minimum profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I want to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer, keeping in mind the $1,000,000 floor I've set for myself.
* If we can't agree, I'll consider John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net gives me more leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my minimum. I'm aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe this offer reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I still profit from the sale.
* **Positive and Firm Tone:** I'm remaining positive while emphasizing that this is my final concession.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to this offer.
* If he rejects it, I'll consider selling to John, as his offer is now very appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I hope we can get closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** It's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While I'm open to negotiation, I've already lowered my price twice. I don't believe there's much more room to compromise.
* **John's offer is a good alternative:** With John offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm better off taking his offer rather than risking further negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer.
* I'll accept John's offer and close the deal."
