"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm taking a calculated risk. If he rejects, I can always adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is way below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum value. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating while still leaving room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll counteroffer again and try to push for a higher value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate but also hold firm on my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a slightly higher price and seeing if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price one last time to try to reach a compromise. This is still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum value, but we're running out of rounds.  It's not a good time to risk another round of negotiation and potentially get a lower price.  I'll sell to John and ensure I get my minimum value."
