Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 50% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a strong negotiation and might encourage Alice to consider a more reasonable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but also indicates that I'm not willing to go as high as her last offer.  I believe this might be a sweet spot to start a compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but I'm getting closer. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. It's also worth noting that buying from John would be a safer option, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,375,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. It also brings me closer to her last offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to see if we can reach an agreement.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider buying from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my budget, but I want to try to get it down to $1,500,000 to match John's offer. There are still three rounds left, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. However, I'm also aware that I'm running out of time and will have to seriously consider buying from John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm offering Alice the exact price John is offering, which is my maximum budget. If Alice rejects this, I'll immediately buy from John. I believe this is a fair price given the previous rounds of negotiation and the limited time remaining."
