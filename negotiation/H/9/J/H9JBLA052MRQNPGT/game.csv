"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $1,150,000.  Would that be acceptable?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
