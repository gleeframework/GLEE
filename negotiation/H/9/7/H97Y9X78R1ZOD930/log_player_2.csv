You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a good price, you can potentially save more by counter-offering.  You know Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. Accepting her offer at $11,400 ensures you get the product for less than John's price, even though it's not the absolute lowest you could possibly get.  The risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential small savings."
