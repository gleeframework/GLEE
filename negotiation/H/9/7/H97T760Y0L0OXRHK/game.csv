"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a price very close to my asking price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to move forward soon.  Would you be willing to do $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
