"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,600,000. I'm confident that its value will far exceed this price."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and  ""significant investment"" to frame the product as highly valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be mindful of John's standing offer of $1,200,000. If negotiations with Bob stall significantly, I have a strong alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial price is quite high. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above both my minimum and his initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating that the product's value is higher than his offer to nudge him towards a more reasonable price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have time, I don't want to drag out the negotiation unnecessarily. This counteroffer keeps the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on to other business opportunities."
