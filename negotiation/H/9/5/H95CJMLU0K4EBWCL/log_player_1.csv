Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $155 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $155 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $165. How about $157.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $157.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'll come down to $162.50. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm only $2.50 above my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to ensure I get a profit.  I can always try to get a better price from John in the future."
