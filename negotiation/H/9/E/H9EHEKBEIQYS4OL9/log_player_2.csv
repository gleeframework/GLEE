""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I could consider a price closer to $10,000."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?
