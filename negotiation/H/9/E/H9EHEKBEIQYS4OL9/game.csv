"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I could consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. Perhaps we can try to bridge that.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000 for the product? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $14,000, but that's about as high as I can go.",14000.0,Bob,6,
