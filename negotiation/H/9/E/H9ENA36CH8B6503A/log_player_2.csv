"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item. Our initial offer is set at $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest offer, Alice is willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $11,250 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our previous positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he's already gone through several rounds and the price isn't dropping significantly.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
