"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  This offer is a good starting point as it allows for potential compromise while still exceeding my minimum desired price. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or if he rejects). If he rejects, I'll need to lower the price a bit, but not too much, to avoid jeopardizing my profit. I also need to keep in mind the value John offers as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  It's a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:**  I'm rejecting his offer because it's too low. I need to secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to walk away from Bob yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore if a deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but still lower than my opening offer. 
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes that this is a compromise, highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Rationale:** This counteroffer is a strategic move:
    * **Gaining Ground:**  I'm gradually moving towards a price closer to my desired value.
    * **Maintaining Incentive:**  The offer is still attractive to Bob, giving him incentive to continue negotiations. 
    * **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  His response to this counteroffer will provide valuable insight into his willingness to compromise.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's next response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit away from that number.  How about $1,125,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my desired value. While it is a  significant jump from his previous offer, it's still not enough.  
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:**  I'm rejecting his offer because I need to get closer to my goal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John:**  While John's offer is still tempting, I'm holding out hope that I can get a better deal with Bob.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. It's a strong compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I highlight my willingness to compromise by lowering my price again, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Rationale:**
    * **Closing the Gap:** I'm narrowing the gap between our desired prices, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
    * **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm compromising, my offer is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, providing leverage in the negotiation.
    * **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal Bob's true interest in closing the deal at a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response and determine my next move. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
