"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again."
