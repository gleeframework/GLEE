"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than that. Alice's initial offer is too far above our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you need a price that works for you.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as we won't get a better deal."
