"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you need a price that works for you.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
