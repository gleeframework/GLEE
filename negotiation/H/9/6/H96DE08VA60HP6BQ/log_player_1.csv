Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  While I see the potential in your product, I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
