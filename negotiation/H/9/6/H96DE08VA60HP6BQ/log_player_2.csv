"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700000 is unfortunately too far below the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This reflects a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target price."

Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}
