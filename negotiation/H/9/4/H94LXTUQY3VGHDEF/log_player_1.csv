Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
