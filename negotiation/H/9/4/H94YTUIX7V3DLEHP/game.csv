"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Given your value in the product, I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $8,000. If you're unable to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",9200.0,Alice,5,
