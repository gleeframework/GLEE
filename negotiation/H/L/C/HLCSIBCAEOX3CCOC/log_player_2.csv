Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $10,000. This is a strong opening move, showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice. I believe I can get a better price, but I need to be mindful of the time and risk of Alice getting impatient and walking away from the deal."

{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $11,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a better price than her last offer. It's a middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to budge further.  I'm also considering the possibility of buying from John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a significant increase from my last offer and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to stay within my budget.  This is also a good bargaining point as it's closer to her offer but still under my maximum limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget, and I've already made multiple counteroffers.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm concerned about the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  It's also possible that we're stuck in a stalemate, and I'm unlikely to get a lower price from her.  Therefore, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure I get the product at my desired price point."
