"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong opening offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate further. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice has come down considerably, and while we might be able to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll stop negotiating.  $650,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
