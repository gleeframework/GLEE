"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you can still acquire the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:**  Start with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value of $80. This demonstrates you're serious about buying but want a fair deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $85 still leaves some wiggle room for Alice to counter without losing too much. 
* **Be polite:** Maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $90?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a slight improvement, it's still above your target price.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice seems amenable to it.  
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** You can always get the product from him, but you want to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. How about $88? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight increase:**  Increase your offer slightly from $85 to $88, showing you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Highlight the value of a quick deal:**  Mentioning ""ready to buy today"" might incentivize Alice to accept, as she may want to close the deal quickly. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keep the conversation friendly and encouraging."
