Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the value and benefits of the product, I am unable to accept the proposed price of $6,800. My counteroffer would be $7,500. This still represents a significant discount from its value to me, while providing a more substantial benefit to you.

You should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You're already at $7,500, and you know Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's still room to negotiate."
