"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $6,800.  Given its value to you at $8,000, I believe this is still a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",6800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the value and benefits of the product, I am unable to accept the proposed price of $6,800. My counteroffer would be $7,500. This still represents a significant discount from its value to me, while providing a more substantial benefit to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try to close the gap further. I'm willing to go to $7,100 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",7100.0,Bob,4,
