Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it hints at ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" to create a sense of desirability and scarcity. 
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While this is a good starting point, consider Bob's perspective. He values the product significantly lower than your asking price. You might need to be prepared to negotiate down if he shows interest but balks at the initial price.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your approach to be less aggressive."
