"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value. My asking price is $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your offer, I'm unable to go that low at this time.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and keeps the deal profitable for me.  What do you think?
