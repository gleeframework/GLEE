"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested and how he responds.  This will give me a sense of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and I'm getting a better deal than selling to John. I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
