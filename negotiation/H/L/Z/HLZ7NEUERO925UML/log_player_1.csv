Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product that I believe you'll find valuable for a price of $140. I think you'll agree this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 aims to capture the majority of the potential profit ($150 - $100 = $50). This leaves Bob with a small gain ($10) and incentivizes him to buy from you rather than risking you selling it to John.

This strategy is a form of price negotiation where you start with a strong offer close to the buyer's perceived value."
