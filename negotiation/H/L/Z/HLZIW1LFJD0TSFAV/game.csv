"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find some middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $1,125,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,125,000 is close to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,100,000? It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
