"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're providing, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $11,000.  This feels like a fair price point for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price point of $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
