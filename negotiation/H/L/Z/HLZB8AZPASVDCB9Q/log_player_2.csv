```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! How about $112.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is within your budget. It's a good deal for you, and you're likely not going to get a significantly better price from Alice in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer saves you time and effort, and it's a good middle ground in the negotiation."
