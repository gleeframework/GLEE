"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's still a great deal for a product worth $150, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is a good product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you on a product worth $150.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
