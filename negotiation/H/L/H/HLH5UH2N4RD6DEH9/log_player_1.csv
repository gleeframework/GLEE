"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $10,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I still have 8 rounds to work with. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still keeps me above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left. I believe I can get a slightly higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a further compromise, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm trying to gauge how high Bob is willing to go. If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate the situation and decide if I'm willing to go lower or if I'll switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left. I believe I can get a slightly higher price with a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a significant drop from my last offer but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, while still being strategic. If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's disappointing that I couldn't reach a better deal with Bob, but we're down to the wire. I've tried to negotiate a higher price, but Bob seems unwilling to go any higher.  I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially get a lower offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further risk."
