Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer and still reach a price that's beneficial for both of you. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** A high initial offer shows Bob that you're not desperate and are willing to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always counter Bob's offer or accept his counteroffer. If you feel he's not serious about buying, you can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too low for the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what I consider to be fair. I'll counteroffer with a price that's still above my minimum but also shows I'm serious about selling to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $13,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

This counteroffer balances a few things:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's lower than your initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still profitable:** $13,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, so you're still making a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob still has space to counteroffer while staying above his $11,000 offer, giving you a good chance of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. 

Here's why:

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is your minimum acceptable price, so you're not losing money.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Although you're at your minimum, you still have the option to counteroffer if you believe you can push for a higher price. However, Bob might be less likely to negotiate further, especially since he's already met you halfway.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to Bob guarantees a sale, whereas selling to John is also a possibility but carries a risk if Bob decides to raise his offer after you sell to John. 

It's a good idea to secure a sale at your minimum price, especially since it's possible to continue negotiating with Bob later."
