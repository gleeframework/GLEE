"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
