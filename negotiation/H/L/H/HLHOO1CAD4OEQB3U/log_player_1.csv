"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
