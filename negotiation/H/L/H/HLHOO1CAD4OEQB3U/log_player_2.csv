"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000**. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** There is a significant gap between Alice's asking price ($1,000,000) and your maximum budget ($1,200,000). This gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.**"

Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
