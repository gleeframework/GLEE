"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $650,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $675,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
