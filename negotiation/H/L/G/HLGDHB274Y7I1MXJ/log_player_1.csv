Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,250,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I do believe this product would be valuable, but the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? This reflects a more reasonable investment on my end while still acknowledging the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value. While it's early in the negotiation, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table. It's worth countering and seeing if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a profitable partnership."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Standing Firm:**  We started high to leave room for negotiation but dropping to his offer price is too drastic. We need to hold firm to signal we know the product's worth.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""true value and potential"" we're moving away from a purely price-based discussion and emphasizing the long-term benefits for Bob.
* **Gradual Concession:** Coming down by $300,000 shows we're willing to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate you moving on the price, it's still a larger leap than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,525,000?  This shows I'm serious while acknowledging the value this product holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it a profitable sale.
* **Middle Ground:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate by meeting in the middle. Accepting this offer shows we are also willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better offer, and we risk Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal without further delay."
