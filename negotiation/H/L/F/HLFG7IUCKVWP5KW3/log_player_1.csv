Round 2
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

I'm still not happy with the price Bob is offering. While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can convince him to go higher."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from Bob.  He's clearly not willing to go much higher, and I've already made several concessions.  Rather than risk losing out on a good deal, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
