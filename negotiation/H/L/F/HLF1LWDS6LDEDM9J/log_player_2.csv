"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. Given its significance, I believe it's only fair to extend this offer with a price that reflects its true worth and acknowledges your potential to appreciate and utilize its full potential. Considering the product's intrinsic value to you, which I understand to be $1,200,000, I propose to sell it to you at a price of $950,000. This offer allows you to secure the product at a premium yet reasonable cost, ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification about the product, and I would be more than happy to provide it. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but it's still significantly higher than what Alice values the product at. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I might be able to get Alice to lower her price further."
