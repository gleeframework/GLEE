**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $1,400,000 and buying from John for $1,500,000 still keeps the total cost within Bob's budget of $1,500,000. However, rejecting Alice's offer allows for the possibility of negotiating a better price with John in the future."
