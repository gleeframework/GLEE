"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is significantly beyond my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing but would need to see a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, as a starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
