"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product holds immense value, and I believe a price closer to $1,800,000 reflects that. Let me know if this price works for you, as I'm eager to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product holds immense value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,500,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
