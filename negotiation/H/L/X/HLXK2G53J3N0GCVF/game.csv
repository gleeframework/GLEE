"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to compromise again and propose a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
