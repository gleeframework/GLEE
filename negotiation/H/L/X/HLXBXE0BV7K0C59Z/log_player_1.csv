Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and recognize the value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it. This represents a significant saving for you compared to selling it to John, and it would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
