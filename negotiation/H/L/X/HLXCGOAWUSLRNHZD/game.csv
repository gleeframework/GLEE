"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $50 for this product. Would that work for you?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $50 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
