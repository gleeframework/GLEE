"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it at this price again.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. If this is acceptable, let's finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, but $1100000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if it's acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
