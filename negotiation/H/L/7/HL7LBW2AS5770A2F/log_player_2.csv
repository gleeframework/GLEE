# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly wants to sell the product and you have a lower price point in mind."
