"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly offers exceptional value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still out of my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to spend on this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  Let's make this work - $16,000, and we have a deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
