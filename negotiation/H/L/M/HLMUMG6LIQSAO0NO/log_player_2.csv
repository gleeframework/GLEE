Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping to meet halfway and find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
