{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still allows for some potential negotiation.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob gets a good price and I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm proposing a counteroffer that's in the middle of my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to significantly lower my price. I'm hoping that this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $10500 as the price for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push the price even higher.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $10,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering a final compromise price of $11,000. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it's closer to my target price of $15,000. I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am comfortable with a price of $10750 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has come up on his offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not sure if further negotiation will yield a better result, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $15,000. I'm going to sell the product to John."
