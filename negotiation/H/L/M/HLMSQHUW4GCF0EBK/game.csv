"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $1,100,000, given the price John is offering. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between $1,100,000 and my valuation is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still quite high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the price John is offering. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
