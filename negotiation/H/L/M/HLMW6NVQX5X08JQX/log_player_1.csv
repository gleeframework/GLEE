Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves a small margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell at any cost. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you had more information, you could potentially push for an even higher price."
