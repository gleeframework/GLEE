Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and its value is readily apparent. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, you have room to negotiate higher. Starting at $1,900,000 aims for a significant profit margin.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses confident language to subtly reinforce the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he makes a counteroffer. If his counteroffer is too low, you can always walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
