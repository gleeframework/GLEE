# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
