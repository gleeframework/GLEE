"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get the product for closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, I think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $130, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He's already shown willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further. Rejecting allows Bob to keep the pressure on and potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and what you're looking to get. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
