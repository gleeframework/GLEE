"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, I think. ",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and what you're looking to get. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
