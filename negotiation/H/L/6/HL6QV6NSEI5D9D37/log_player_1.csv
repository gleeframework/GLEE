Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still offers him a potential ""deal"" compared to our fallback option (John).
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive. However, it firmly establishes a high baseline for the negotiation."
