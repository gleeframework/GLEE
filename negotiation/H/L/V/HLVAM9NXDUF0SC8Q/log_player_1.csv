Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is more than your $120 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $140, since the product is worth $150 to him.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could scare Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
