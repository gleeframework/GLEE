{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $120 is still below my acceptable range. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a slightly lower price and see if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* **Selling to John is an option:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $120 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price of $125, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also  holding my ground.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that $125 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further dialogue and see if he's willing to compromise. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $125 is above my minimum price of $150, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would $120 still be too low for you, or could we find a middle ground closer to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $115 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even his willingness to negotiate to $115 suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower final price, further decreasing my profit. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a much safer option compared to the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to sell at a higher price, given the current situation, selling to John is the most financially beneficial and least risky choice."
