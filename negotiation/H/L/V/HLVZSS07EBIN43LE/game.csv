"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $120 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would $120 still be too low for you, or could we find a middle ground closer to $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
