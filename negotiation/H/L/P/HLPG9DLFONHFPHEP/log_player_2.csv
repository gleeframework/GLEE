"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating with her to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred $10,000. There's still room to negotiate, and you can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm at $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget. While there is a possibility that she might budge further, it's not guaranteed.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially going back and forth several more times. Buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sound decision, as it ensures I get the product within my budget."
