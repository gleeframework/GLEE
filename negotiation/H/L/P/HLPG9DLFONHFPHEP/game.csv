"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm at $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",12500.0,Alice,5,
