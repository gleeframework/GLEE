"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's intrinsic value and potential ROI warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet even the $1,750,000 price point. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
