"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm currently working with a budget of $1200000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount? I believe this product has great potential, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of this product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about we settle on $1350000? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $1250000?  This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
