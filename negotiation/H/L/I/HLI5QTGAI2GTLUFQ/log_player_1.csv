Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.  If he rejects and offers a price lower than $12,000, I'll likely counteroffer or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy with $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it gives us both some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering John is only willing to pay $12,000.  It's worth closing the deal now and avoiding further negotiation."
