Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net you a quicker sale and still a great profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that signals the value of the product while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal (saving $500 from your backup offer). 
* **Open Communication:**  The friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in negotiation if he's interested."
