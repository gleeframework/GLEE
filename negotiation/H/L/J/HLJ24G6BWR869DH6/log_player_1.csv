"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. $11,000 is too low, and I can still potentially get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too low. I can still get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $12,000. I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer the product for $12,500. This price still allows you to get a great deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price, but I've already reached round 6. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not sure if we can reach a better price with Bob.  To ensure a sale and avoid further risk of a lower price, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
