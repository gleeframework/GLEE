"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer the product for $12,500. This price still allows you to get a great deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we make that work?",12000.0,Bob,6,
