"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for compromise. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. I'll continue the negotiation with Bob to see if I can get a better price, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Move closer to Bob's offer:**  The counteroffer of $950,000 moves me closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight potential value:** I reiterate the potential value of the product to Bob's business, encouraging him to see the offer as a good investment.
* **Offer a compromise:** I frame the $950,000 price as a compromise, making it seem more appealing and fair. 

This approach aims to maintain my negotiating leverage while showing flexibility and continuing the dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's the highest I can go. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not yet in a desperate situation, and I have more rounds to negotiate. 

By rejecting this offer, I can potentially push Bob further up in the next round. It's important to remember that the longer we negotiate, the more likely Bob is to become more flexible to secure the deal.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me a good profit, but I still have the chance to get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite there for me.  Considering the significant value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show continued flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** The offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, reminding him that I am not desperate to sell and I have other options.
* **Reiterate value:** I continue to emphasize the value and potential of the product for Bob's business. 
* **Emphasize opportunity:** I frame the offer as a great opportunity for Bob, encouraging him to take advantage of it. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome while ensuring I maintain a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down further, but $975,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This represents a substantial compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a better offer than previous rounds, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not yet in a desperate situation and have four rounds left to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting this offer, I can potentially push Bob further up in the next round. Selling to John right now would guarantee me a good profit, but I still have a chance to get closer to my ideal price with Bob.  With each round, the pressure on Bob increases, as the opportunity cost of not securing the product rises."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $925,000 is a solid offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to $950,000. This product truly has the potential to make a significant impact for your business.  To show my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility and compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate further by moving closer to Bob's offer.  
* **Emphasize the finality of the offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Reiterate value and opportunity:**  I reinforce the potential benefits of the product for Bob's business. 
* **Frame it as a fair price:**  I present the offer as a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 

With only a few rounds left, I want to create urgency and a sense that we're nearing a deal.  The offer is still relatively close to my desired price, and if Bob rejects it, I can always sell to John."
