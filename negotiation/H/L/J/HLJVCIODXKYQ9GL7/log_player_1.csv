Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $11,000 is below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting close to my initial asking price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
