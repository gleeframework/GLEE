"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That price is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me to let go of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
