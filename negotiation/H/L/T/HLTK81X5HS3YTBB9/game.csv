"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your offer, $1650000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire to keep costs low, but $1680000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1715000.  This would give us both a good deal, and I don't think I can go any lower.  What do you say?",1715000.0,Alice,5,
