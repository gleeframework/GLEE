Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey value and confidence in the product, potentially persuading Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. If Bob rejects it, there's room to negotiate downwards, ultimately aiming for a price higher than my minimum of $15,000."
