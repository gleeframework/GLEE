,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $90? It's a good price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price considering my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's the maximum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,5,
