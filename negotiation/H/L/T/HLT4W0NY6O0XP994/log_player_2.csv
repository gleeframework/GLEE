"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000.
* While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or even decide to walk away. 
* Accepting the offer at $1,350,000 secures the product at a good price and avoids further risk."
