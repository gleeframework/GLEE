,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident this product will deliver strong results.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This price represents a fair value for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I've already offered $1,150,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, so I'm reiterating my offer of $1,150,000. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
