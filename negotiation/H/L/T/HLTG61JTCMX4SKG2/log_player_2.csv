"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($800,000) and not the best possible deal for Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds great, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what he wants to pay.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $875,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above what he wants to pay. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to risk another round to try and get a lower price, and hopefully, Alice will accept his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go to $890,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $890,000, but I'm not ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking outside the box. I'll sell you the product for $915,000, but I'll throw in some additional value - I'll include a 2-year warranty and a dedicated support package. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $915,000 is still above Bob's ideal price,  Alice's offer includes additional value: a 2-year warranty and dedicated support. This extra value makes it a more attractive deal.  Considering the limited rounds left, and the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price, accepting this offer makes the most sense.  Bob is getting a good deal, and he's securing the product."
