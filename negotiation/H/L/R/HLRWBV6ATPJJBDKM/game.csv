"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is my final offer. If we can agree on this, we can both be happy.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
