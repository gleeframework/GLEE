Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer is $100,000 less than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
