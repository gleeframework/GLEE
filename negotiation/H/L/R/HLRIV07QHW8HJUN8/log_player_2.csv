# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1.5 million to me.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $2000000.  This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Please let me know if you're interested, and we can schedule a time to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for a much lower price."
