{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:** $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for $2,000 less than its value to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion and want Bob to be happy with the deal.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to counteroffer. If he's not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean losing a considerable amount of money.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000, which guarantees my minimum price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and signaling my intention to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $8,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that this price is still a great deal for him, as it's significantly lower than the product's value to him.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for further discussions and potential adjustments. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to get closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and cooperative tone.  I believe $9,500 is a reasonable compromise that Bob might be willing to accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to make further counteroffers or to fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach an agreement. I am willing to increase my offer to $8750. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, which is a good sign.  He's also increased his offer, which suggests there might be a possibility of reaching a more favorable agreement.
* **John's offer is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I have John's offer as a safety net, which guarantees me my desired price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my desired target. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,125.  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,125 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's current offer of $8,750. This demonstrates a genuine commitment to reaching a compromise.
* **Finality:** I've included ""Let's close this deal!"" in my message, implying that I'm ready to finalize the transaction at this price. This puts pressure on Bob to consider seriously.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, ensuring Bob understands the value of the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to accept the deal. By offering a price that's exactly in the middle, I make it difficult for him to justify further negotiation without appearing unreasonable.  If he rejects this offer, I'll consider John's offer, as further negotiation might not yield a better result."
