"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I can go all the way up to $14,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'm not yet ready to accept a deal below my minimum, and I believe I have room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to that minimum, I need to consider the risk of further negotiation. It's possible that Bob could walk away, and I don't want to lose this deal entirely.  $13,000 is a good compromise and ensures I'm still making a profit."
