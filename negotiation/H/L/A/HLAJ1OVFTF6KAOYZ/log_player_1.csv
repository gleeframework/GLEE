I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price.  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $11,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good compromise, and I'm getting close to my desired price.  It's not worth risking another rejection and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
