Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement.
