Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It's ambitious, but not unreasonable considering the product's value to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but also establishes a high baseline for the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've expressed in the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm worried that continuing to negotiate with him will only lower the price further.  John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is the best I can do at this point."
