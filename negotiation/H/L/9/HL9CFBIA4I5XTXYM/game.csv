"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that gives you a decent profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",825000.0,Alice,5,
