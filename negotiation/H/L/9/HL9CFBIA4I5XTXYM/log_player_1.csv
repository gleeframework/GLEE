Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
