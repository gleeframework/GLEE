Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $112 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $118, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $118 is a decent deal compared to John's $120 price."
