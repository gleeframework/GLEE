Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1320000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.

```

We are getting close to the end of our negotiations, and even though Bob's offer is closer than before, I'm still below my desired price point. Considering the time constraint and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John."
