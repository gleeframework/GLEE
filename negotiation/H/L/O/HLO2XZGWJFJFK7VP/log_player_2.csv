"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and gives you a good discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her value and what John is offering. There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a price close to Alice's valuation, we aim to anchor the negotiation in a favorable range. 
* **Gauge Alice's Reaction:** This offer will help gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and provide insights into her bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this initial offer, it leaves us ample room to increase our offer gradually in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This still gives you a significant discount, and allows me to get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice reducing her price to $100 indicates she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Room for Improvement:** The new offer is still $20 above her value and $50 above what John offers.
* **Maintain Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better price and maintain our negotiating position for future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're gradually increasing our offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significantly lower price.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:** $90 is a reasonable price point â€“ still a good discount for us but a decent profit for Alice compared to her $80 value.
* **Psychological Impact:**  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" can sometimes encourage agreement even if it's not mathematically the exact middle."
