"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not *that* good. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 to make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my valuation of the product is significantly higher due to its unique features and long-term potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point better reflects the true value you'll be gaining.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still very far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're open to a deal at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite reflect the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet in the middle -  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
