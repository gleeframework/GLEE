"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $9,000? That would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to reduce the price further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $9,800 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. To meet you in the middle, how about $9,400? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,400 is getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,600, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9600.0,Alice,7,
