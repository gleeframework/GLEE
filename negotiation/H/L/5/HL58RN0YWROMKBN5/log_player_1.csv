"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well. This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $130 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. There are 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my earnings.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his. My goal is to gradually work towards a price that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $140 to $135, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum value of $150, keeping me in a favorable position.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically lowering my price by a small amount to encourage Bob to accept, but also keeping it high enough to ensure I still make a decent profit. I'm also using a positive tone to build rapport and potentially influence his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $125 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  
* **Limited time:** We're already at round 4, and I need to be strategic about how I use the remaining rounds.
* **John as a backup:** I can always sell to John for $150, so I don't feel pressured to accept a low offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value but still above $125. My goal is to find a middle ground that works for both of us before I run out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's fair to both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway, showcasing a genuine desire to reach an agreement. This is more appealing than simply rejecting his offer again.
* **Still profitable:**  $130 is above my minimum value and still a reasonable profit.
* **Clear and direct:** I'm explicitly stating the price I'm willing to accept, making the offer clear and easy for Bob to understand.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough to encourage Bob to accept. By presenting it as a fair compromise, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful deal.  If Bob rejects again, I will continue to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm ready to consider selling to John if necessary to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're already in round 6, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further from his initial offer. 
* **Close to minimum:** While $122 is only slightly above my minimum value of $150, it's not a very satisfying profit.
* **John as a secure option:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John for the following reasons:

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob isn't worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.
* **Time is money:** It's more efficient to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk losing valuable time with Bob.
* **Maintaining value:** By selling to John, I ensure I don't have to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum. 

I'm confident that selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision in this situation."
