"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and confident tone encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** Emphasizing the value to Bob helps him see the potential benefits.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to start a negotiation that balances my goal of maximizing profit with the possibility of reaching a deal.  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, I have more rounds to negotiate and John is a guaranteed sale for a much better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about $1,150,000? This would allow us to both come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  By highlighting ""both coming away satisfied"", I emphasize a win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a measured approach, demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome. This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it is still significantly lower. I have more rounds left and a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product, even though I know Bob might be getting closer to his limit. I will continue to push for a higher price in the next rounds.  It's better to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,125,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's aim for a win-win."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering a compromise again, meeting Bob halfway between his previous offer and my last counteroffer.
* **Focus on Fair Value:** I highlight the ""value to both of us"" to reiterate the shared benefit of reaching a deal.
* **Win-Win Approach:**  This phrase emphasizes that a successful negotiation should benefit both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. This strategy aims to find a compromise where both Bob and I can agree, without jeopardizing my potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,090,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm getting closer to my target, I still have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain leverage. I can continue to negotiate with Bob or, if necessary,  move forward with John's offer. The risk of missing out on a potential deal with Bob is outweighed by the potential of reaching a much better price with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still not quite where I need it to be.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  If we can bridge this small gap, we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I acknowledge Bob's final offer, but I'm also firm in my counteroffer.
* **Compromise Again:** I'm proposing a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for both parties to justify my price.
* **Win-Win:** I emphasize the importance of a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my goal. This strategy aims to secure a higher price by showing that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my desired outcome. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to make one final move to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,085,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price, and with only two rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic decision to maximize my profit. While there's still a chance to get a higher price from Bob, the potential for a more favorable outcome with John outweighs the risk of potentially losing out on that deal."
