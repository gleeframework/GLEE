"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",70.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,75.0
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which is $77.50. Can we discuss this price?",77.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $82.50. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go above $80. I'm willing to meet you at the price that John is offering, which is $80. Can you consider this price?",80.0,Bob,6,,
