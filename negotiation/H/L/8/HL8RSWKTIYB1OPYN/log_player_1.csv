"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which is $77.50. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $77.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a slightly better price with another counteroffer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $82.50. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go above $80. I'm willing to meet you at the price that John is offering, which is $80. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. I'm happy with the $80 that John is offering, but Bob is also offering $80.  While I'd love to continue negotiating and potentially get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether. 

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the $80 I'm comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or Bob backing out completely."
