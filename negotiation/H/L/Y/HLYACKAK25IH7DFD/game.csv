"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $12500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're making a strong case for $11500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about $12200? I think we can both be happy with that.",12200.0,Alice,7,
