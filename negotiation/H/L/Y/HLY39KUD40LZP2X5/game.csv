"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's potential and my desire to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its potential value, but given my current budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 to $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budgetary constraints. While $1050000 is closer to my expectations, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1125000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction in price, however, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1125000. Considering my budget constraints, I am prepared to offer $1075000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to move forward in a mutually beneficial way.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I'm not comfortable going below $1100000. This price still leaves room for both of us to gain value from this transaction. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
