"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",10000.0,Bob,4,
