"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum value.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. There are still a few rounds left and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm not going below $100 yet. I'm showing flexibility, but I'm also trying to get a price closer to my minimum value."
