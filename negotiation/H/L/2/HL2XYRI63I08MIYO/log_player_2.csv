"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product. I'm interested, but  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good profit for Alice. This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $13,000 is a good compromise.
* **Better than John:** This price is still $2,000 less than what John is offering, making it the best option for Bob.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and he might end up paying more in the long run. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets a good deal and secures the product, achieving his goal of saving money."
