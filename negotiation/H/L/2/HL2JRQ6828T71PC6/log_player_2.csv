# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 represents the high end of its value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,000,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent worth of the product.

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still more than I want to pay. It makes sense to try another counteroffer."
