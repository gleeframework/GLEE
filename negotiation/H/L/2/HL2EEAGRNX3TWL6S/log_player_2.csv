"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,500,000.  It's not worth risking Alice sticking to her price and missing out on the deal entirely."
