"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $17000 for it. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $17000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $19000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $18000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a good compromise for you, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $18500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
