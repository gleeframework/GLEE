{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can still get a good price, even if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left. I'm not in a rush and I want to try and squeeze a little more out of the deal.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that's profitable for me. He's not budging on his offer, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so it's time to cut my losses and move on."
