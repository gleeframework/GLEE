"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so this offer gives me room to negotiate down.
* **It's ambitious:**  It shows Bob that I value the product and am confident in its worth. 

By being bold upfront, I'm setting the stage for a successful negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round.  Here's why:

* **It's still above my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. 
* **I have room to negotiate:** I can still counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices.

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Here's why I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000:

* **It's a compromise:** This price is halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  I'm not willing to go below $800,000, but this price is still significantly higher than that.

By meeting in the middle, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also holding firm on my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round.  Here's why:

* **I'm still looking for a higher price:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price if I continue to negotiate.

While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'm motivated to get closer to the $1 million mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $975,000 is a more realistic price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000 because:

* **It's a small step closer:** This is a compromise from my previous offer of $1,050,000, but still above Bob's last offer of $975,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's a psychologically significant number:** Rounding up to $1,000,000 is often seen as a more appealing and memorable number.  
* **I'm still aiming for a good profit:** While this is lower than my initial goal, it's still a significant profit and well above my minimum of $800,000.

By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer and keeping the goal of a strong profit in mind, I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. Here's why:

* **Close, but not quite there:**  While $990,000 is very close to my target of $1 million, I'm still not convinced that I can't get a slightly better price.
* **I've shown flexibility:** I've already lowered my price significantly, and I believe that Bob is likely willing to go a bit higher. 

It's important to note that I'm now starting to run out of time.  If I don't close a deal soon, I might have to accept John's offer of $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and we're definitely getting closer. Let's split the difference and go with $995,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

I'm offering $995,000 because:

* **It's a small compromise:** It's only $5,000 higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **It's a strong closing number:** It's a round number close to $1 million, which can make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **It's a good deal for me:** While not my ideal price, it's still well above my minimum and a significant profit.

Given the limited time, I'm aiming to secure a deal that's both profitable and avoids the need to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $995000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's my final offer. Can you reconsider?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** and sell the product for $990,000. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the final rounds, and I don't want to risk having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **We're very close:** The price is only $5,000 lower than my last offer.  
* **It's a strong deal:**  $990,000 is a significant profit and still well above my minimum.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a deal that is both profitable and avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether."
