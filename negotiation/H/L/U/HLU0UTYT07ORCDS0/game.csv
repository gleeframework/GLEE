"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $975000 is a more realistic price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1000000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
