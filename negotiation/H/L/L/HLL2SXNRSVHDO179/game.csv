"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let's meet in the middle of $105 and $95, which is $100.",105.0,Alice,5,
