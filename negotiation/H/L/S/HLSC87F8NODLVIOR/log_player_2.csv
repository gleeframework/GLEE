"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum price point of $120. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $110 is a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially acceptable to her, given that her minimum is $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's maximum price point, it's still above his target.  Bob has a few rounds left, and there's still potential to negotiate a better price. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $110 to $115, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's most recent offer of $125, but it's closer to her desired price point. This could potentially encourage Alice to accept the offer, especially since Bob has limited rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 matches Bob's maximum price point. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that aligns with his budget."
