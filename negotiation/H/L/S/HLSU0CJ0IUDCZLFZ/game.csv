"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $10,000. How about $10,500?  I think this price is fair considering the product's value to you, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
