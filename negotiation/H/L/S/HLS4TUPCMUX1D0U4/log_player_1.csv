"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This initial offer sets a high bar while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a strong opening move that gives me the best chance of maximizing my profits while leaving space for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than my minimum threshold, it's still lower than my initial target. I believe I can do better.  I'll counter Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I think $9,250 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something a little lower. Would you be willing to do $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  Let's make this our final exchange to save us both some time.  How about $8,800?  If that works, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is tempting and close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for such a small profit. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  While I value our time, I'm aiming for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
