Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $977,500. This is the best I can do. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to agree to a price that's significantly lower than her last offer.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk running out of rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe bet at this point."
