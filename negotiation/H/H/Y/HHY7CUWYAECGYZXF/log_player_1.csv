Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I can try to get a better price from Bob, or sell to John for my minimum price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $13,250.  If you're not interested, I have another offer on the table for $12,000, so time is of the essence."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12750? I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price and I'm concerned about losing the deal with Bob. I'd rather have the $12,750 now than risk getting a lower price in future rounds."
