"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a little better for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
