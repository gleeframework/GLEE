,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too far below my desired price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be well worth it for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my bottom line.  I believe you'll find this product is worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the highest price possible, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on this one.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
