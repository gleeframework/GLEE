"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, as it's significantly more than what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original $900,000 offer to $850,000. This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly less than what he'd pay John ($1,500,000).  It's also likely that further negotiation won't get Bob a much better price."
