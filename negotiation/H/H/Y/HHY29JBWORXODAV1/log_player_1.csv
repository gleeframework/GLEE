Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it leaves some room for negotiation, knowing that the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120.  It's likely we'll continue to haggle, but accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
