"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further and save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's not guaranteed to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and ensure I get the product, I'll take the guaranteed price from John at $1,000,000."
