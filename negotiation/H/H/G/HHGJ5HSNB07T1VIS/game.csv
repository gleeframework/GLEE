"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that work for you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
