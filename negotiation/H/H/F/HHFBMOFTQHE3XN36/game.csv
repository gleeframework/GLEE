"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1350000. I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'd like to make a revised offer. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you're offering. Can you consider my revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your revised offer is closer to what I'm looking for. However,  $1250000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm offering. I'm prepared to go down to $1300000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
