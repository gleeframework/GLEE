Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** By offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum, there's a chance he'll accept immediately, avoiding the need to deal with John. 

Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at her minimum acceptable price."
