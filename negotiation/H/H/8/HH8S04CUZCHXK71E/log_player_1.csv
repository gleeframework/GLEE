"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for it, as that's my maximum budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80 from John, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
