"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and $7,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000. Let's try $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. That said, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's really the most I can do.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
