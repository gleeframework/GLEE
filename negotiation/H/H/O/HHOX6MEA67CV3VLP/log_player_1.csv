Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $20,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $15,000, he doesn't know that you have a guaranteed buyer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher starting price increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, but it also maximizes potential profit if he accepts."
