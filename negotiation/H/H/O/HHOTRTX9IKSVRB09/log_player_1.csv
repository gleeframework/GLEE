"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn.  I'll accept his offer."
