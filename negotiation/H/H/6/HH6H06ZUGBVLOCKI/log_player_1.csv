Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm not saying this is my ""final offer"" which leaves the door open for counteroffers and keeps the negotiation going. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how valuable the product appears to be to him."
