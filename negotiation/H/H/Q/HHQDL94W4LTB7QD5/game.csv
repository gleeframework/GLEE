"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $850000 is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I still think $850000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $850000. How about $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775000 is still below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference once more. How about $812500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's just a small step closer to what I need. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but no higher. Can you accept this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
