Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it."",
""product_price"": 11900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer it at a price lower than his valuation but higher than John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Alice's fallback option ($12,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a good profit. 

By setting the price at $11,900, Alice creates a win-win situation: Bob gets a product he values for less than his perceived value, and Alice maximizes her profit beyond her guaranteed offer from John."
