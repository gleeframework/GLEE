"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Offering $80 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room to increase the price if needed, but this initial counteroffer sets the tone for a lower price point. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a polite and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows us to continue the back-and-forth to try and get a price closer to our initial $80 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  I'm really hoping to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning wanting to ""close the deal today"" adds a slight sense of urgency without being pushy.
* **Focus on Value:**  The phrase ""I'm really hoping to close this deal today"" implies that we believe the product is worth the price, which can help Alice feel more confident about accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about we settle on $88?  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're now only $3 away from our original counteroffer. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing us to buy the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, without risking further negotiation."
