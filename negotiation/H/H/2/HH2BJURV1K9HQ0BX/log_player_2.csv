"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its incredible value. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Please consider my offer of $1,400,000. Let's discuss further and finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You have room to negotiate further with Alice, or potentially find another seller. Rejecting her initial offer gives you more leverage."
