Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the significant value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to move down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal given the potential returns you stand to gain.
