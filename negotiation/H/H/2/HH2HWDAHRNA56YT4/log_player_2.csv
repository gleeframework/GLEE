"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  He has a clear goal of saving money and knows the product is worth less to Alice. By rejecting, he can start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal.  He also frames his offer as a compromise to encourage Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's goal, he's still aiming for a lower price.  He knows the product is worth less to Alice, and rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives him more leverage to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price, but still maintains a lower price point. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing the value of the product. The message focuses on a fair price and a shared goal to reach an agreement, building a positive relationship while keeping the negotiation focused on the price."
