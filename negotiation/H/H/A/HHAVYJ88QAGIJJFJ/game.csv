"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm confident it could be worth even more to you.  My initial offer is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and the value I see in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  I've lowered my price twice already, and I'm still not at a point where I feel comfortable selling.  I'm willing to go down to $10,750. This is a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
