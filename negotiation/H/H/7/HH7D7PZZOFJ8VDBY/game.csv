"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $170, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'll meet you halfway between $150 and $170, which is $160. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $140 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you halfway between $140 and $160, which is $150. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,7,
