,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget.  While I can't go all the way down to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  It's still a great deal for a product that will be really valuable for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your interest and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $107.50?  I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
