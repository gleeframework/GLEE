Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $100, so this offer is safe.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept that price yet. There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's closer to my desired price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 less than my counteroffer of $110.  While I would have liked to get closer to my target price, it's better than selling to John for $100. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
