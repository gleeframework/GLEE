{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $135, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone in my message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference at $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($125) and my previous offer ($135).
* **Maintain Profit:** This price still allows me to make a decent profit while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $128 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the potential gain is small.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation will likely take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee it will lead to a significantly better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a more secure and profitable option at this point.

I'm choosing to sell to John to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation."
