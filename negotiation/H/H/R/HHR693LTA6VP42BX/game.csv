"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm happy to offer $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,325,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,325,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit stretched.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,250,000 is a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
