"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has potential, but $800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment. Would you be open to $675,000? I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth and your potential return on investment.",725000.0,Alice,5,
