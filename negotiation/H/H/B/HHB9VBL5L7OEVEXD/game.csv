"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see it closer to $800,000 to make it work. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still far outside my budget.  To be transparent, I've located a similar product for $800,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm still interested.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact that you're still interested. While the product you mentioned might share some similarities, I'm confident mine offers unique advantages.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,600,000.  This recognizes the value I bring while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still too far apart. I'm serious about the $800,000 alternative I have.  I can go up to $700,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to go with the other option.",700000.0,Bob,6,
