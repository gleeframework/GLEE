"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and indicates there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing how low Alice is willing to go before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see it closer to $800,000 to make it work. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $500,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point that's closer to your budget. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range. This might encourage Alice to make more significant concessions.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  You're signaling willingness to negotiate upwards, but only if Alice comes down substantially from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is decreasing, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit. Alice's counteroffer suggests she's willing to negotiate, but there's still a large gap to bridge. It's worth testing her flexibility further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still far outside my budget.  To be transparent, I've located a similar product for $800,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm still interested.  Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mentioning Your Alternative:** By introducing John's offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and giving Alice a concrete reason to lower her price.
* **Increasing Your Offer Slightly:**  The bump from $500,000 to $650,000 shows you're willing to move, but only if Alice makes a significant move as well. 
* **Staying Firm:**  Your message reinforces that $800,000 is your realistic upper limit, managing Alice's expectations for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact that you're still interested. While the product you mentioned might share some similarities, I'm confident mine offers unique advantages.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,600,000.  This recognizes the value I bring while acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making some concessions, but her latest offer is still double your budget.  It's clear that Alice is very attached to a much higher valuation. It might be time to begin moving away from the negotiation or issuing an ultimatum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still too far apart. I'm serious about the $800,000 alternative I have.  I can go up to $700,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to go with the other option."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum Time:**  You've been negotiating, but Alice's concessions haven't been substantial enough. It's time to set a firm limit and signal that you're prepared to walk away.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Slight Increase, But Below Limit:**  The $700,000 offer shows some flexibility but stays under your absolute maximum. This leaves you room to walk away if Alice doesn't budge."
