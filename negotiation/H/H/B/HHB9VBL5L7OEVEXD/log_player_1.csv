Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still too far apart. I'm serious about the $800,000 alternative I have.  I can go up to $700,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to go with the other option.

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute ceiling, and his final offer of $700,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to close the gap, and accepting his offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer."
