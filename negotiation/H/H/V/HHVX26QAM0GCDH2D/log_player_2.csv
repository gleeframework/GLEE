"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a significant investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You're looking to pay no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a premium price for this product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account the gap between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still $25,000 above your maximum. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute top limit.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows us to finalize this deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 800000}
