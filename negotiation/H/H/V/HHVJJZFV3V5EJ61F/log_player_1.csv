Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too far off. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a bit more than my minimum. It also shows I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to go down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $105, which is still a bit higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm flexible but still aiming for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $105 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to sell to him at that point.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
