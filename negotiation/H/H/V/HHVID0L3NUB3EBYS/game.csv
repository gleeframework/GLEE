"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. Could you consider stretching to $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another option.",8500.0,Bob,4,
