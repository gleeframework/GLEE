,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, so how about $120? That's a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,
