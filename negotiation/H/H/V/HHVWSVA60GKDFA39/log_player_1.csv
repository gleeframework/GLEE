Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,500,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep costs down. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate further. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can nudge him closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  Let's find a path forward.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,475,000?"",

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We are getting close, but I believe I can still secure a slightly better deal.  Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller, indicating he's nearing his upper limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. How about $1,465,000? This reflects my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,455,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,455,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,455,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept.  Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while it's slightly under my ideal price, $1,455,000 is a strong offer and a sure thing.  Dragging the negotiation out further risks losing the deal entirely."
