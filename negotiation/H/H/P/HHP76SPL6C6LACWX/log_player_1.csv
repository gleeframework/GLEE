Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $2,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to considering buying from John. Can you meet me at $1,900,000 or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

While ideally, we'd like to get closer to $2,000,000, Bob is clearly signaling he's nearing his maximum price. Accepting $1,900,000 ensures a good profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him going with John or further lowballing."
