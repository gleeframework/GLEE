Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is higher than my guaranteed price from John, giving me room to make a profit. It's also a relatively aggressive offer, potentially enticing Bob to accept if the product holds significant value for him. 

However, without knowing Bob's valuation, there's no way to guarantee acceptance. If he rejects, I can still secure my guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. This strategy balances risk with the potential for a larger profit."
