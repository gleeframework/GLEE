Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I think my previous offer was already a generous one. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

You can likely negotiate further.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than the counteroffer you made.  There's still room to bargain and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to budge from my previous offer of $1050000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to prioritize getting the best price for the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $1050000.

Alice has clearly stated that she's not going to budge from her price.  While you could continue to negotiate, you are running the risk of her walking away from the deal entirely. At this point, it's better to take the deal and save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
