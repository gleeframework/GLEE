Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet at least $10,000 to make it worth my while. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I'm now offering the product for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
