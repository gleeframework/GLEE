"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet at least $10,000 to make it worth my while. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I'm now offering the product for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  Even with the extras, it's not worth the extra $2,250 over what John is selling it for. I'm going to buy from John."
