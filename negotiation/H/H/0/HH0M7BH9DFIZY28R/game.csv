"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet at least $10,000 to make it worth my while. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I'm now offering the product for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
