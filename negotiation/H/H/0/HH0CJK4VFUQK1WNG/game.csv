"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $108.75. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",108.75,Alice,5,
