Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
