Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500 is a reasonable starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately lose out to John's $10,000 offer. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I want to maintain a positive and open dialogue to encourage Bob to negotiate rather than simply rejecting. 

I'm confident that I can get closer to my $10,000 target by negotiating with Bob, but I'll be prepared to accept his counteroffer if it's reasonable or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation. 

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet him in the middle. I believe that playing it strategically will yield a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? That's a good price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive language:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement (""good price for both of us""). This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Clear objective:** I'm stating my desired price point directly, making it clear what I'm aiming for. 

This counteroffer is a calculated move to strike a balance between getting a good price and avoiding further delays that could lead me to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is still lower than my initial goal, it's a decent compromise.  The negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely.  Furthermore, I am getting closer to the $10,000 mark with every offer. There's a chance that Bob will offer a higher price next round, but there's also a risk that he might reject my counteroffer and I would be forced to accept John's offer. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $8,750, which is better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best decision to maximize my potential profit."
