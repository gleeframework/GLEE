"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing it as a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and his offer ($9,000).

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $9,500.  
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, the chance of getting Bob to come up to my price is slim.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer guarantees $12,000, which is a more lucrative option than taking the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd like to get a higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is too high.

**Conclusion:** It's time to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid potentially losing out on a better deal."
