Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm concerned that if I keep negotiating, I might end up with less than that.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing it completely."
