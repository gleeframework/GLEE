"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is too high. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable with, given its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You have more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and counteroffering is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's fair to both of us considering the value to each of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I can't go lower than $8,500. This is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price, but you're still $500 over your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more. You might be able to get Alice down to your target price, and even if not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'll go down to $8,400, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $400 higher than your target price.  You have a few rounds left, and you can always go with John's offer if necessary.  It's worth trying to squeeze out that last bit of savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,400 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,250.  It's a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I have another option available."", ""product_price"": 8250}
