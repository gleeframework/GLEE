"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to budge closer to my desired price point.  $700,000 is a substantial discount from her original offer, but still above my ""walk-away"" price with John.  I'm hoping this will initiate a more productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get the product for a lower price, $750,000 is a good deal considering my alternative is $1,000,000 from John. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a significant savings."
