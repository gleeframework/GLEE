"Bob, I believe this product could be of significant value to you, potentially worth far more than the asking price. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be transparent, my absolute top budget for this product is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, selling this product for less than $1,000,000 would mean losing money for me, and I'm sure you can appreciate that I can't do that. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,100,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
