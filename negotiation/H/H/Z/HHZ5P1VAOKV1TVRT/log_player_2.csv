"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $150, and $110 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John. While there's still a small possibility of getting a better price, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to pay $150 from John outweighs the potential benefit."
