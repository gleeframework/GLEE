Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a starting point, and I'm confident that I can get a higher price from Bob since he values the product at $1,000,000. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I won't accept any counteroffers that are lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than what Bob offered. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still unwilling to meet my desired price point. While $950,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still not enough for me.  Considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I will choose to sell the product to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
