"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a little higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, though, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $112.50, which is as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings.",112.5,Alice,5,
