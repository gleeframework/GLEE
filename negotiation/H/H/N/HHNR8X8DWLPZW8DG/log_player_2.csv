"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider coming down to $450,000?"",
""product_price"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly below your target price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable but Firm:**  While $450,000 is a big jump down, it shows I'm serious about buying but need a price that works for me.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important throughout the negotiation process."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

""product_price"": 500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By countering with $500,000, I'm showing Alice I'm willing to move towards her price, but in smaller increments. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing to express appreciation for her willingness to negotiate keeps the conversation collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $525,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down considerably, and $525,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000 price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the difference is unlikely to be substantial enough to risk losing the deal with Alice altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
