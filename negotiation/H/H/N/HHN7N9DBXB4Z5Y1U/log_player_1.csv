"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without making it seem like I'm desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get closer to my desired $140.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $100 is safe, the risk of continued negotiation could lead to a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $130? It's still a great deal, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price, making it a good deal for me.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" and ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** Bob's offer is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Factor:**  We're already on round 4, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  $125 is a good price, and it's important to secure a sale, especially since I have a backup offer from John."
