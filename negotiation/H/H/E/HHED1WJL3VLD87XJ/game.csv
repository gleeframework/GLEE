"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your desired outcome and the value I see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
