"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $10,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
