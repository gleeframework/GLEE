"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I find the asking price of $1,900,000 to be a bit high. I'm interested in exploring a mutually beneficial deal. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the initial price.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,700,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part, while still acknowledging the true worth of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to move up to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while respecting my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,250,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
