"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal, but I can potentially get it for less. 
* I'll try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a little more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $100 to $95, which is getting closer to my target price. 
* It's still within my budget, and I'm confident I can't negotiate much lower. 
* Buying from John would cost me $120, so accepting Alice's offer is a better deal."
