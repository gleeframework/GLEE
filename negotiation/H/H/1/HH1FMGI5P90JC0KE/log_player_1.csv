Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a little more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
