"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I can't go any lower than $9,750. This is truly my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're able to accept it.",9750.0,Alice,5,
