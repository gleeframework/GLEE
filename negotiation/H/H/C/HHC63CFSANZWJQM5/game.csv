"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,500. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"This is getting close, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit to $11,500.  Do you think that would work?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. How about we settle at $11,750? This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11750.0,Alice,7,
