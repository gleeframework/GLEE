{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price is just below Bob's maximum valuation, increasing the likelihood he'll accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, and you have some wiggle room to still make a profit. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob rejects, you're guaranteed your minimum acceptable price from John."
