"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $8000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $9000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a profit.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on that price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
