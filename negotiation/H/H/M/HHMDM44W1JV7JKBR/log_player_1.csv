Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $18,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $18,000 price point. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price closer to $8,000? I believe we could find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is anchored at $8,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  It's not worth further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John."
