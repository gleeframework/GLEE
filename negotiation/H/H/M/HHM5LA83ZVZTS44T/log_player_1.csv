Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between getting a high price and keeping Bob interested.  It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's more than John's offer, I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a higher price than he offered."
