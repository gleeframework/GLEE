Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $85. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still within what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is tempting, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is just above my minimum, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further back and forth and secure the sale."
