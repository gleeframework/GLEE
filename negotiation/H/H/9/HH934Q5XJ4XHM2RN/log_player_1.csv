Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget.
