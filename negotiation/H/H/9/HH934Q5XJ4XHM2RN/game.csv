"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1500000. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1150000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1120000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1120000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
