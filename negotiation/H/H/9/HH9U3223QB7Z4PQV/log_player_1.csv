Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a steal considering its potential!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price. It's worth trying to push for something closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
