"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think this is a fair deal, considering it's significantly more than half your asking price.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,,
