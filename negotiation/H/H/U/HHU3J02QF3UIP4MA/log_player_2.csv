Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her final offer of $975,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the better deal with John."
