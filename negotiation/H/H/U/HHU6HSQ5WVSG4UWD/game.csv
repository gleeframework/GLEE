"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you wanting to sell it to me, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $78? That's a fair price and would allow us to make a deal.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $82. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, which will add significant value to the product. I can offer it to you for $81. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the extra perks!",81.0,Alice,5,
