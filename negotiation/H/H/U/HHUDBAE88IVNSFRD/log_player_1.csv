This offer gives me a good starting point. I'm offering a price that's lower than my minimum but still provides me with a decent profit. I've also framed the message in a way that highlights the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
