"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be reasonable here. $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  However, to show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is my final offer.  If it works for you, let's make this happen. If not, I'll have to move on.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
