Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly coming up in price, and we're still well above our minimum acceptable price. It's worth seeing if we can push him a little further.  We're getting close to a price I think we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I think we're close to a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go to $120. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we are still getting a price significantly above our minimum ($100). Accepting $110 now secures a good profit. It's not worth risking John changing his mind for an extra $10."
