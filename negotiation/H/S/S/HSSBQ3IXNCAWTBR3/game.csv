"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $150.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for me right now. How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $117.50.  How about we settle on $115? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
