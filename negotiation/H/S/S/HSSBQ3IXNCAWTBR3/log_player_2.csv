"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $125 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $150.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for me right now. How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. Bob is willing to negotiate further and aims to get the price below $115. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $117.50.  How about we settle on $115? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
