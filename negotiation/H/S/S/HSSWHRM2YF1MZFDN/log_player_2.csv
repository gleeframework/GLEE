"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000  which reflects its true worth and the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or move on to John's offer as a backup."
