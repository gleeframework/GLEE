Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer to Bob, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000  which reflects its true worth and the value it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming slightly below this ($1,150,000) gives you a strong chance of securing the sale while maximizing your profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** By emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's immediate value, you encourage Bob to act quickly and not risk losing out.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating your bottom line ($1,000,000),  the message subtly implies the product's high value, justifying the asking price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you can adjust the message and price accordingly.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial in the long run."
