"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a little too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,875? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",7875.0,Bob,6,
