"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $1175000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1140000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",1140000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1140000. I'll meet you halfway between $1175000 and $1140000, which is $1157500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1157500.0,Alice,7,
