Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $145 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($120) and leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, I create a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
