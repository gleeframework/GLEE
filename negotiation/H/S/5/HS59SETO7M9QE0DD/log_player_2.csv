"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start negotiations at $110. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is offering the product for $110. While this is a good deal, you can still potentially save money by rejecting the offer. If you reject it, you can buy from John for $120, which is still within your budget."
