"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject and see if we can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for this product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for me. I'm determined to get the product for my maximum budget.  I will counter again to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,800,000 is still out of reach.  Considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I also have to consider what this product is worth. Your last offer is closer, but I can't let it go for less than $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While we've made some progress, I don't think there's enough room for further negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. It's best to cut my losses and buy the product from John for my target price."
