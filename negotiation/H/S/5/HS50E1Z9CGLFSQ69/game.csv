"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for this product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,800,000 is still out of reach.  Considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I also have to consider what this product is worth. Your last offer is closer, but I can't let it go for less than $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
