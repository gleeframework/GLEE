"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price well below its worth to you, while still giving me a significant profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, there's still room for negotiation to save more money. You can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try to get her down further with a counteroffer."
