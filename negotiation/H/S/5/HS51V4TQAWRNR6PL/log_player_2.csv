"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than our ideal price. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $100 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with an aggressive counteroffer at our ideal price. This tactic:

* **Establishes our target:**  Alice knows immediately what we're aiming for.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have rounds to gradually increase our bid.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will indicate how willing she is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. While $110 is closer to our target, we still have room to bargain and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** We're suggesting a price directly in the middle of our last offer ($100) and Alice's counteroffer ($110). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal.
* **Framing as a win-win:**  By saying ""a fair price for both of us,"" we emphasize the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal. 
* **Maintaining momentum:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving and avoid getting stuck."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll offer the product to you for $112. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to haggle, but her concessions are getting smaller.  We're still significantly below our ""walk-away"" price of $150 from John. It's worth pushing a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to be fair. How about we finalize this at $107? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** We're only increasing our offer by $2, signaling that we're getting close to our limit. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  Phrases like ""finalize this"" and ""close the deal today"" add a touch of pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Positioning:** By repeating that $107 is a strong offer, we subtly reinforce our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $114. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to wrap up the negotiation. Here's why:

* **Diminishing returns:** Alice is barely budging on price anymore. Her latest offer is only $2 less than the previous one. 
* **Time investment:**  We've already spent several rounds, and there's no guarantee we'll get a significantly better price from Alice.
* **Reasonable price:**  $114 is a decent price, especially considering our alternative is paying John $150. It's within our budget and saves us a good amount of money.

While we didn't get the product for our ideal price, we successfully negotiated a discount and avoided overpaying with John."
