"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can push him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $100 is exactly halfway between my minimum price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates flexibility and fairness.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message remains positive, reiterating that $100 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Clear next steps:** The message clearly states what I'm looking for and invites Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite enough.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100, ensuring I get my minimum desired price.  I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
