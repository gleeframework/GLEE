"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good deal, Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could we do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's try $90. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,5,
