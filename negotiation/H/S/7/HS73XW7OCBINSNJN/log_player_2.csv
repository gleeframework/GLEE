Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's try $90. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and it's better to secure the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay rather than risk the negotiation breaking down."
