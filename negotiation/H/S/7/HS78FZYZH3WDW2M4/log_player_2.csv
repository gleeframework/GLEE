``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,700,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to work with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,400,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to me.  This sets the stage for a negotiation."
