"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is a healthy starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also reflects the value of the product to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will be a more agreeable number and move us towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him. There's still a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes Bob's needs while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has finally come to my minimum acceptable price.  I will accept his offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to have closed the deal."
