Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Bob is only offering $65.  I'm not going to accept a loss. It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me and Bob is offering $70.  This is a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
