"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $13500. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer of $11500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $12800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12800. I'd like to make a final offer of $11500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",11500.0,Bob,6,
