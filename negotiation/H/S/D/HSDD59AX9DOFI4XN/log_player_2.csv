"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. While it's a lowball offer, it leaves room for negotiation and lets Alice know your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you're still above your ideal price. Let's see if you can negotiate a little further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?"",
 ""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

This counter-offer shows you're willing to compromise but still want a price closer to your initial offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward."
