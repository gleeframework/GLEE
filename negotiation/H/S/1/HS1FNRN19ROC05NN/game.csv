"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's unique value while also acknowledging your financial considerations. I believe this price offers a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
