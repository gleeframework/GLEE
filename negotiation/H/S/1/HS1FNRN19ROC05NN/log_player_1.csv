{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. It's truly unique and I believe it can be a game-changer for you. My initial offer is $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I highlight the product's benefits to Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message signals a willingness to compromise, creating a collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started favorably while also leaving room to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product and understand its value. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he clearly sees the value in the product. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a fallback option provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price point while still keeping the negotiation open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's unique value while also acknowledging your financial considerations. I believe this price offers a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:**  I mention the product's uniqueness again to remind Bob of its potential benefits.
* **Positive closing:** The message ends on a positive note, emphasizing the potential for a successful deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer while keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
