"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also reflecting the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and make a counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a fair price for myself.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable price, and it's more than I'd get from John.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
