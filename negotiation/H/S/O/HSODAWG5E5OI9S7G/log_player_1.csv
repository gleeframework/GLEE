Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $14,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his commitment, $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  How about we compromise again and settle on $12,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached a point where I'm confident I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob within the remaining rounds, and it's better to secure the deal with John rather than risk getting nothing at all."
