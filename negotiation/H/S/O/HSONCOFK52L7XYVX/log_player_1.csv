Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. Aim for a price that gives both of you a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and highlights the product's value without revealing your bottom line.
* **Price:** $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 gain and you a $100,000 profit above your minimum. This split incentivizes Bob to accept while maximizing your potential earnings.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is fluid. Bob could counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but remember your minimum and John's guaranteed offer."
