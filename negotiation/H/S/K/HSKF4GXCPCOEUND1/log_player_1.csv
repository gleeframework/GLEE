"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
