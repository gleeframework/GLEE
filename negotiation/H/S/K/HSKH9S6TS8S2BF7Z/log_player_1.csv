Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and your own valuation. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, $800,000 is my minimum threshold and it's a good price for both of us. There's no point in risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
