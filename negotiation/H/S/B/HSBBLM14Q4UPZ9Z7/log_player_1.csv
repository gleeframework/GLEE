"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from here.
