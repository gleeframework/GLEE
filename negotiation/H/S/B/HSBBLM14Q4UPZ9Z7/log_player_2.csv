"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is too high, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
