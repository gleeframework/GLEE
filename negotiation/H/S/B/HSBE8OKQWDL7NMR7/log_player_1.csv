"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum price point. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further. I still have time left in the negotiation and don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price, and I'm confident that the product is worth it to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I'm ready to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm not comfortable risking another round where he might not accept my offer. Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees me my desired price and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
