"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $17,000. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $14,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  Would you consider $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but $15,500 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",14500.0,Bob,6,
