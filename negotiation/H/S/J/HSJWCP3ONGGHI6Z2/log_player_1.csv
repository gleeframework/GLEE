Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to see if he's willing to pay more than he initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is already higher than what the product is worth to him. It's better to take the sure deal now than risk losing out and having to sell to John for a lower price."
