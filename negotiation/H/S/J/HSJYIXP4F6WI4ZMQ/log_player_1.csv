"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point as it's more than what I'm willing to accept but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that the product is likely worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  Bob clearly values the product, and I'll try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to $100. How about $95? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to propose $93 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and $93 is just a few dollars away from my minimum acceptable price. It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
