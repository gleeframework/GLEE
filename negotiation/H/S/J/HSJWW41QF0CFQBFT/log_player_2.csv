"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get a great product at a fair price, and I'll get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, it's worth seeing if you can get a better price. You know John is a fallback option at $150. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, getting you a better deal."
