"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",12500.0,Bob,4,
