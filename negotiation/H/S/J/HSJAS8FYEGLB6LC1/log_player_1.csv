Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum price of $12,000 and it's likely that I won't get a better offer from him. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's not worth risking the sale to John for a potentially small gain."
