"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

Let's start high to test Bob's willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price close to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $7,500 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price that reflects its true value. How about $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Strategy:** We're coming down slightly to show flexibility, but holding firm above our minimum and close to Bob's perceived value. This balances our desire for a high price with the need to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is now getting closer to our minimum price, and this offer exceeds what John is offering. Accepting avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or us running out of rounds."
