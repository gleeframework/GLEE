"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  He should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still a bit above Bob's target of $1,000,000.  However, it's closer to his limit.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since John is offering the product for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice, allowing Bob to acquire the product while saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
