This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum threshold. It allows room for negotiation while still giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
