"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This allows you a substantial profit margin while also providing me with a fair return. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
