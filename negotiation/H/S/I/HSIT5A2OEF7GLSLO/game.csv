"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $12,000, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $9,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $9,500. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $9,000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to sell it to me for $9,000, I'll also take on the installation costs, which will save you some money. Can we make a deal?",9000.0,Bob,6,
