"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $95? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to offer $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $100, $92 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $80, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
