Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) because I know the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making him think he's getting a good deal even at a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* I'll keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if I'm not satisfied with Bob's negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I understand its value to you, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($800,000), it's still far below my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  I can still try to secure a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, likely around $950,000. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss for myself.
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers stay too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $950,000. This price is fair given the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" solution, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and avoiding an adversarial tone.
* **Maintain my Floor:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not losing too much.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll re-evaluate my options. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000. 
* If Bob's counteroffer gets closer to my minimum, I'll be more open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000. This price is fair considering both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  I'm trying to avoid further back-and-forth, as it could lead to Bob walking away or me ultimately having to sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer allows for the possibility of a future deal with Bob, potentially at a higher price if the product's value increases.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.
* I will continue to build a relationship with Bob, hoping to establish a long-term business partnership."
