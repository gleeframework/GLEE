Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're still looking for a better deal. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'll offer the product to you for $650,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her best offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are shrinking and there's a risk Alice will hold firm. Accepting at $650,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
