"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,200,000, and I'd like to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
