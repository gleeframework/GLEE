"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high to go that low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $12,250. This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,5,
