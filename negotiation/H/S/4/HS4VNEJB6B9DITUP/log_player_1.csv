Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and it's more than I'd get from John.  I'm happy to close the deal!"
