"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree this product has value, I'm looking to make a more strategic purchase. Would you be willing to consider $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation.
* **Strategic Goal:** By aiming low, we're trying to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a deal well below our $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Future Leverage:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us room to gradually increase our bid in subsequent rounds while still staying below our budget and leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Moving:** Her counteroffer indicates she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** While closer to our budget, $950,000 is still above our ideal price. We can likely negotiate further.
* **John as Backup:**  We still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so we're not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be transparent, my absolute limit is closer to $900,000. If we can land somewhere around there, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Boundary:** We're clearly stating our price limit to signal our seriousness and manage Alice's expectations.
* **Urgency and Commitment:**  Phrases like ""ready to close the deal today"" suggest we're eager to finalize the purchase if our terms are met.
* **Minor Concession:** While we haven't budged significantly, offering a round number like $900,000 can sometimes make the deal more psychologically appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your absolute limit is $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While not our ideal $900,000, $920,000 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and our alternative option with John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might walk away, leaving us with John's $1,000,000 offer.  
* **Time Factor:** We've already used 5 of our 10 rounds.  Securing the deal now gives us some buffer if unforeseen issues arise."
