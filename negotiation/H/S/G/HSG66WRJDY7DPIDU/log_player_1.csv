Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential gain:** By offering $1,500,000, I have the potential to earn an additional $500,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a higher profit. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
