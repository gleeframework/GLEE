"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you consider my revised offer?",9200.0,Bob,4,
