Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value of $80, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $80.  While I want to sell the product, I won't accept a price that's below my minimum. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $75.  That's still a good deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 
 
I'm offering $75, which is halfway between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing my ground on a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $70? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum value of $80.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move on."
