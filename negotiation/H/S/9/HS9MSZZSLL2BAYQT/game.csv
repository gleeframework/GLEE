"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $1000000 to $1200000. I would like to propose an offer of $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
