Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your $8,000 minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't miss out on a sale entirely."
