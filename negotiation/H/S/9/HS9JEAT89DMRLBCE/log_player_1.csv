Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a perceived gain.
* **Provide Incentive:** The offer is a significant discount from the $12,000 John is willing to pay, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message suggests flexibility, potentially leading to a higher final price. 

By starting high but expressing willingness to negotiate, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly above his perceived value."
