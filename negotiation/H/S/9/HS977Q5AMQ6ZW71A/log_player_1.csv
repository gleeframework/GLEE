"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,750?"", ""product_price"": 7750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $7,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
It's unlikely Bob will go above $7,200, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
