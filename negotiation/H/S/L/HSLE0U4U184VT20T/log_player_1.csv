Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm being positive and enthusiastic, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also leaving the door open for discussion.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price below my minimum, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. If he seems truly interested but is unwilling to go higher, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can push for a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to strike a deal that's more favorable to me. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fantastic price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away too much.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also framing the price as a ""fantastic deal"" to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

By offering $11,500, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better sense of his willingness to pay and can decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I can't go above $10,000 for this product. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $10,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I would like to get a better price, I'm at a point where I'm better off accepting John's offer.

**Strategy:**

It's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome for me. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids potentially endless negotiations with Bob."
