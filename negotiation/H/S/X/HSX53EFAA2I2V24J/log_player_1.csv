Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  While Bob might reject this, it sets the stage for potential compromise and gives me room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering in the next round."
