Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a profit significantly higher than my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping he'll see it's a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $132 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
