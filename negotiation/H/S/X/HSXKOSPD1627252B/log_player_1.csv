Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while also showing I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can reach a middle ground, but I won't settle for such a low price immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still being reasonable for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my minimum and I risk losing out to John if I continue to negotiate. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid any further potential delays."
