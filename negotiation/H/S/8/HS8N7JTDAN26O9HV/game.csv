"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
