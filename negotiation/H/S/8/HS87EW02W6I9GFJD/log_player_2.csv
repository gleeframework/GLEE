You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice is asking for $100. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?

You're still above your budget of $80. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Alice down further."
