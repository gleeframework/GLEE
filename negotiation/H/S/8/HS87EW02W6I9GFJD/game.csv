"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $80?  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still just a little over my budget. I'm willing to go to $85, and that's really the very best I can do. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
