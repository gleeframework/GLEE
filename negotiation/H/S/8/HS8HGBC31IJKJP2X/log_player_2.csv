"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice is offering $900,000.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as she is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  There's potential for saving money here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still above her minimum acceptable price.  This allows for some negotiation space while still being a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your previous counteroffer, it's still cheaper than buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and sending another counteroffer allows you to try and secure a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, but she's still below your fallback option with John.  Offering $900,000 is a compromise, as it's in the middle of your previous offer and her current one.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, while still attempting to get a better deal than her latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to John's price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as the potential savings are minimal, and there's a risk she'll continue to increase her price.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at a known price, minimizing the risk of further negotiations."
