Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $115 is his final offer. This is still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $150. It makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
