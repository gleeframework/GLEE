Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong but not outrageous offer allows room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** Aiming high initially gives you the best chance to secure a higher final price.
* **Leaves Space for Negotiation:**  Bob is likely to negotiate, and this offer gives you room to come down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Demonstrates Value:** A high initial offer signals that you believe the product is worth a significant sum. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome while acknowledging Bob's potential counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's room to counter and potentially secure a better deal.  It's unlikely Bob would offer his absolute maximum upfront."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

*  **Holding Firm:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a lowball offer. 
* **Strategic Concession:** A $50,000 reduction from your initial offer demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Above Minimum:** This price still keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price, aiming for a more profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving towards the middle ground. While a higher price might be ideal, accepting at $1,300,000 secures a significant profit of $100,000 above your minimum. 

Further haggling could risk:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might be firm on this offer, leading to a dead end.
* **Losing the Sale:**  Pushing too hard could lead Bob to walk away entirely.

Accepting now guarantees a good deal and avoids the risks associated with prolonged negotiation."
