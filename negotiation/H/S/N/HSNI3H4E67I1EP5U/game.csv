"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
