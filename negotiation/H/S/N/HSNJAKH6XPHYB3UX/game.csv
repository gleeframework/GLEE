"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, reflecting the unique value it holds. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $775,000 is still below what I need to consider.  Let's compromise - I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to meet my needs. Let's finalize this deal, Bob.",825000.0,Alice,5,
