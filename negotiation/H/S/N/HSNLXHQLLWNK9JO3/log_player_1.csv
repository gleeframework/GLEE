Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I appreciate the quality and performance of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to match the price of $15000. Would you be willing to lower the price to $12000? I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
