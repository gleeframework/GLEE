"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly.  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a decent profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not happy with $13,500. It's closer, but I'm willing to hold out for a little more. I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I might seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering my minimum is $15,000, and it's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure we'll be able to close the deal with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to pay what I feel is fair for the product, and we've already used half of our negotiation rounds. While $14,200 is better than my minimum, I'm not sure we'll be able to get him any higher.  To avoid risking losing out entirely, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose out."
