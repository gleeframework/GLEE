"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. However, I am interested in discussing a potential price that might be closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price around $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $800000.
