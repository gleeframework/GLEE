Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price as it is still lower than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is close to the price I initially offered. It's a good deal for both of us.  There is no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round."
