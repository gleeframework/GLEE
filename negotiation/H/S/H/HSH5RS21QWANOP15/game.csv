"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is too low for me.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $7,750 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,250?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair to both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $8,250 is still a tad high for me.  How about $8,000 even?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
