"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still hoping to find a solution within my budget of $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but $90 is still just a little too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would give both of us a good deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
