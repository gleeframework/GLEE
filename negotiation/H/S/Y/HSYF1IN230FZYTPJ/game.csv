"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that's a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
