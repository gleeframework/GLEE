# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that's a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.
