"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $700,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
