Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to reveal that to Bob. Keeping your options open strengthens your negotiating position.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust the price downwards, but it's much harder to increase it once an initial offer is made."
