Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. Here's why:

* **Maximizing potential profit:** This offer gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Setting a strong starting point:** A high initial offer demonstrates confidence in the product's worth and sets the stage for a potential negotiation. 

By starting high, I create a space for Bob to counter-offer, which would then allow me to work towards a mutually acceptable price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counter-offer and weigh it against my potential sale to John.  The goal is to strike a deal that maximizes my profit while still achieving a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. 

Here's why:

* **Seeking a better deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This could encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, so I can take a risk with Bob's counteroffer.

I'll now send Bob a counter-offer that's more appealing to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,050,000 to Bob.  Here's why:

* **Moving closer to my goal:** This offer is closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000, while still being above Bob's initial offer.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  It's a compromise that allows me to potentially secure a good price without completely shutting down the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This offer leaves room for further negotiation. If Bob is serious about buying, he might be willing to meet me halfway. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and evaluate whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further concessions is high, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures I won't be left with a lower price.

Here's why this is the best decision:

* **Meeting my minimum:** John's offer ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would involve more time and uncertainty. 
* **Clear path:**  Selling to John offers a clear and straightforward path to a successful transaction. 

While I would have preferred to get closer to $1,200,000, securing a deal with John at $1,000,000 is the most sensible and profitable option in this situation."
