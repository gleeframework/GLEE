"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's slightly lower than that. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm open to negotiating further if you'd like.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
