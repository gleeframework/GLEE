"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully land a price closer to my desired value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price."

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but by a smaller margin. This shows I'm flexible, but I'm still confident in the product's value.  Hopefully, this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more with a little more negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. We are both getting closer to a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's very close to my desired price, I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push him a little higher.  I'm also aware that I could always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This is my final offer. It's a significant compromise, but it's still a profitable sale. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $990,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired value.  I've reached the final round, and I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get my full price from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
