"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob while still leaving a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth, and I have room to negotiate higher.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to $1,050,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer $975,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and it shows Bob that I'm making an effort to meet him halfway.  It's a high enough price that I still make a good profit, but I'm getting closer to closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer getting lower, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While $800,000 is my minimum, it's still a significant profit and better than risking getting a lower offer from Bob or failing to close the deal altogether."
