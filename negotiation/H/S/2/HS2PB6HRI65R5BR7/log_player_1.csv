I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for a great product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a higher price from him.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob, or having him reject my next counteroffer."
