"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and would still allow you to make a good profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $17000. This is the minimum I need to earn to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $17000. I'm counteroffering at $16500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,5,
