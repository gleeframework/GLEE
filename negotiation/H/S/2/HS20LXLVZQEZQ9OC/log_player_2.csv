It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,400,000."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a good starting point, but I'm ready to adjust my offer based on her response."

Alice has come down a little, but it's still worth pushing for a lower price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,300,000."
