"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than what you're actually willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upward if needed.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Justification:** While not always necessary, a brief justification for the counteroffer can help. In this case, simply stating the price is a bit high is sufficient."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to you is substantial. How about we meet halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is a good price, saving you $1,000 from your maximum budget and a significant amount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for further savings, but it also risks Alice raising her price or the negotiation reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now might be preferable to potentially lengthy back-and-forth."
