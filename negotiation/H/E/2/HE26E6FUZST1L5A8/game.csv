"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one? I could do $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than your last offer. I'm willing to go up a bit from $10,000, but I'm not going to go as low as $8,000. How about we try $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, though. How about we split the difference again and call it $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Alice,7,
