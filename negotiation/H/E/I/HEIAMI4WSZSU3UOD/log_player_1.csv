Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining or makes a slightly lower counter-offer more appealing.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $135 is a price point that allows you to potentially earn more than your guaranteed $150 from John, while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to his $120 valuation. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and highlights the offer as something special, increasing its perceived value."
