"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $950,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm unable to agree to $975,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of the product and my budget constraints. I look forward to your response.",960000.0,Bob,4,
