"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have more rounds to go and can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate and slowly decreasing my price, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but I am not willing to sell for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better offer from Bob.  I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I don't get a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm making a small counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap between our positions. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's increasing willingness to pay."
