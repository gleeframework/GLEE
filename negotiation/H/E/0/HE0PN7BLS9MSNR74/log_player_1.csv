"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $4,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more to me to keep negotiating.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $4,500. How about $6,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll counter again, but if this doesn't work, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,200 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to go as low as $7,500. That's a fair price for both of us. If you're not able to meet that, I might need to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $7,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $6,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800

While $6,800 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop to $7,200. That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.  If you aren't able to meet that, I'm going to have to seriously consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 7200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about $6,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting stuck with a lower price."
