"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product. ",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $4,500. How about $6,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",6200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,200 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to go as low as $7,500. That's a fair price for both of us. If you're not able to meet that, I might need to move on to another buyer.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but $7,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $6,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances.",6800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop to $7,200. That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.  If you aren't able to meet that, I'm going to have to seriously consider my other options.",7200.0,Alice,7,
