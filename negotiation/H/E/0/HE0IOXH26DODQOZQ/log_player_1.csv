Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 allows room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price.
* **Fair Offer:**  The price is  $1,000 below Bob's perceived value, making it a fair offer that he might be inclined to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price slightly, but I can also walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit too pricey for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will still be profitable for me while also enticing Bob to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $12,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Showing flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $12,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids any potential losses.  It's a quicker and safer option at this point."
