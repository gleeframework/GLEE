Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $14,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $16,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 16000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still want to try to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $14,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, we're starting to get into a price range that's not ideal for me.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum and a better deal than anything Bob is currently offering. It's time to move on."
