Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a real game-changer, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant savings over your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. I can offer $950,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds to play with. I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do a bit better. How about $975,000? That's my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and while I'd love to push for a bit more, $975,000 is a solid price, especially considering the risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
