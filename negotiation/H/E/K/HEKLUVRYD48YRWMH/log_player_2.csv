"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $12,000, so he should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still get the product for a lower price than $11,500. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further.  He can likely get the price down closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer to get the product for his target of $10,000, Alice has made it clear that's not going to happen. At $11,000, the price is still within Bob's budget and is a decent deal considering his maximum was $15,000.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get a better price from Alice, and buying from John would be more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option here."
