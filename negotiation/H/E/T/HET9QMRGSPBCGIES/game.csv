"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a good balance between a fair price and a profitable sale for me.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit margin.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm working with a tight budget and $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $9,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. This is a final compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,5,
