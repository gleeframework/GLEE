"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. Would you like to make an offer on this product?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it, given its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to the $1000000 I could get from another buyer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $862500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain from other buyers.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $887500? It's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise on my end.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $887500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's try $850000 again. This is a good compromise, considering the value of the product for me and your potential gain from other buyers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
