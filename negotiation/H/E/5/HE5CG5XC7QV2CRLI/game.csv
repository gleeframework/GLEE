"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? I think that's fair.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you want a lower price, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we agree on $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
