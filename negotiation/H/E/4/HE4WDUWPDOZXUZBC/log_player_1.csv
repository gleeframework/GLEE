Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why this approach is good:

* **Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a price that is mutually agreeable. 
* **John as a Backup:** The presence of John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives you a strong negotiating position. You can always walk away if Bob doesn't meet your expectations. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Using language like ""fantastic deal"" and ""confident you'll find it valuable"" can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my value for it and your own. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  

It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your desired value. This will keep the negotiation alive and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the product's value and my potential other buyers, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain Value:**  It's still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than your starting point. 
* **Highlight Potential Alternatives:**  Mentioning ""potential other buyers"" subtly reminds Bob that you have other options. 

By making a counteroffer, you are keeping the negotiation open and giving yourself a chance to reach a more favorable outcome."
