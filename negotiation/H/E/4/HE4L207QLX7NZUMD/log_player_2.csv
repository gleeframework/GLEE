"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
