,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to pay $14,000 for the product. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle, would $11,500 work for you?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a bit more of a compromise, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,200. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",10200.0,Bob,4,
