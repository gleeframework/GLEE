**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still trying to get a price higher than what John is offering.  Since John's offer is within my budget and saves me $50,000, it's the most financially sound decision at this point.  Alice has also indicated this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a better price."
