"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $18,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",18500.0,Bob,4,
