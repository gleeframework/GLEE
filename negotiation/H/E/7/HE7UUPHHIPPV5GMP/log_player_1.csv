Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $600,000 to make it work.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
