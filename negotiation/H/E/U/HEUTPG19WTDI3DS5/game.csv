"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product presents a mutually beneficial opportunity. While your opening offer is fair, I'm aiming for a slightly better price point. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counter.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $1,075,000? This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within my desired range.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
