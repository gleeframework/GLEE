"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while still giving you a fair deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $720,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've reviewed the market value thoroughly, and I believe a fair price point is $860,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledges your budget considerations.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal.  How about $780,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and puts us very close to an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're very close.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $820,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price.",820000.0,Alice,7,
