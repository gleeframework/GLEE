Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while still giving you a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $720,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my baseline, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000, especially since I have another buyer lined up. I'll use the next round to try and bring him closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal.  How about $780,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and puts us very close to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to hold out for one more round. It's worth seeing if I can secure the extra $20,000, especially since he's clearly motivated to buy."

 ""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're very close.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $820,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price."",
