"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down in price, especially since you have a clear upper limit in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. I understand this is a unique product, but I need to ensure the price aligns with my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900000 for it. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target. There's still room for negotiation, and you have several rounds left.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your target budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, and you could end up paying more than $875,000.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
