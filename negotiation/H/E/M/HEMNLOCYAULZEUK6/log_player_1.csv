Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I want Bob to know I'm willing to compromise, encouraging him to counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I can still potentially get a better price by making a counter-offer. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a fair price for a great product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and increases the chance of agreement.
* **Still Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **No Further Room:** I've already made a significant concession, and another counter-offer might risk losing Bob altogether.
* **John is a Secure Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't take a loss. 

It's important to remember that I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I need to balance that with the risk of losing a sale completely. In this scenario, John represents a more stable option."
