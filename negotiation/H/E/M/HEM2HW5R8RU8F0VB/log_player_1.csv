# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $990000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $987500. Can you consider it?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** While $987,500 isn't the ideal price, it's very close to my target of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** I only have two rounds left. If I reject this offer, I risk ending up with the significantly lower price from John ($800,000).
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  It's possible that I could get a higher price if I continue negotiating, but the risk of a lower price with John is too high.

Considering the remaining rounds and the risk of a lower price from John, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic choice in this situation."
