{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage him to counteroffer, giving me a chance to get closer to my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? I really think that's a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum desired price, and it's the same as what John is willing to pay. Since I'm happy with this price, and it seems like we've reached a point of agreement with Bob, I'll accept his offer."
