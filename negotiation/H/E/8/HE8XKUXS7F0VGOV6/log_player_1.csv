Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable.  I believe it's worth $10,000 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't accept anything less than $8,000.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $9,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $9,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you have another buyer (John) subtly emphasizes that this is a time-sensitive offer and adds pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Confident but Fair:** The tone is crucial. It's important to sound confident in the product's value while still positioning the offer as a win-win for both parties."
