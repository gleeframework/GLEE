**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet above $1,700,000.  While there are still rounds of negotiation left, his ""best and final"" offer language suggests he is unlikely to move significantly higher.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the most logical choice to guarantee a sale at a price we know is secure."
