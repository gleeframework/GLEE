{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer sets a high initial price, aiming to start the negotiation in a favorable position.  It also highlights the value of the product to Alice, emphasizing the potential deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I am still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing your interest. This price still reflects the value of the product to me. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to suggest a price of $1,000,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially failing to reach an agreement outweighs the potential gain.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
