"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts and suggestions.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 was a reasonable starting point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price is higher than my initial proposal but still within my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion will help us reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
