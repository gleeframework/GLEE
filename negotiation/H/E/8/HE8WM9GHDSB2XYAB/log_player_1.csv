Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but it's also a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob sees the value and accepts, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is still fair, while also showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to counteroffer.  $92 is a good price, and I'm willing to accept it."
