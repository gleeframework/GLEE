"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm sticking to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While your offer is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. How about we compromise at $1,090,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to earn a profit while also providing you with a significant value. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer to a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,082,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",1082500.0,Bob,6,
