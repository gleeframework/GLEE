Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation, as it's still below Bob's perceived value of $150. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than what you'd like to get.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to your desired value."
