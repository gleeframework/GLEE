"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $9,000.  I believe that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, this product holds significant value and $9,000 is still too low.  To move things along, I can do $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget.  I can stretch to $10,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
