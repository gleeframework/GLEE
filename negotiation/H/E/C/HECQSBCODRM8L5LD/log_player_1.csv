``` 
I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below my minimum. How about we compromise at $9,000? This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob,  we're at an impasse. I've made concessions, and it seems unlikely he'll go any higher. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a sure thing."
