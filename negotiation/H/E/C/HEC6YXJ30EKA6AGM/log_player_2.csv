"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $180. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, giving you ample time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price, but not too low, shows you're serious about negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** A $130 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial $180. This creates space for Alice to counter with a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Assessing Alice's Response:** This will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit.** While it's closer to your desired price of $150, you can potentially get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  You have several rounds remaining to try and get closer to your target price.
* **John's offer remains your safety net.** You have the option of purchasing from him if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a $20 decrease from Alice's last offer, showing your willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Getting Closer to Target:**  $140 is only $10 above your desired price, making it a strong possibility for a deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's commitment to selling and her flexibility on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit.** While it's only $5 above your target price, you're very close to a deal and could potentially get a better price with a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.** You have five rounds left, and a small concession from Alice could lead to a final price closer to your desired $150.
* **John's offer is your safety net.** You can always purchase from him if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is your last chance to negotiate with Alice.  You're offering your absolute maximum price, signaling your commitment to purchasing the product.
* **No More Room for Compromise:**  Any further counteroffers from you would be above your desired price, making it less appealing than John's offer.
* **Putting the Pressure on Alice:** This counteroffer forces Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a small loss or risk losing the sale entirely."
