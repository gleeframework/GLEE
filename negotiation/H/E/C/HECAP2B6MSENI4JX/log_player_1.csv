Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still keeping the deal profitable for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's crucial to consider how Bob might perceive the offer. If the price is too high, he might reject it outright without attempting to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to lower your price."
