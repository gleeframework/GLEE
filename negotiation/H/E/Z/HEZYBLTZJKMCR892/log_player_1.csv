"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired value. Let's find common ground and finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,225,000, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,000,000.  I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob, so I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,210,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're only two rounds away from my last chance to sell to John, and Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
