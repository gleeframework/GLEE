"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price significantly below its worth, and I get a strong return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
