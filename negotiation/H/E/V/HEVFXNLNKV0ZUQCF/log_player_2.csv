"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a better return on my investment. How about we try $1,050,000?
