"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
