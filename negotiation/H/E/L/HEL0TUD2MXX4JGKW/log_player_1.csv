Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($14,000 vs. $10,000) allows room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies a willingness to negotiate by stating ""I'm willing to part with it for..."".

This strategy aims to find a balance between potentially securing a higher sale price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
