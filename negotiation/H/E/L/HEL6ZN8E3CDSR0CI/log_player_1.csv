Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your minimum price, mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price tag. 
* **Gauge interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he readily accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can always lower the price, knowing your bottom line is covered."
