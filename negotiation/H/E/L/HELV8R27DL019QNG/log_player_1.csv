Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters, and you can always decrease the price slightly.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
