Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1000000 is a significant value, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low at this stage.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1250000? This would allow us both to find some common ground.
