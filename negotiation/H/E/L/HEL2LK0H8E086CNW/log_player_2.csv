"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you have no idea what Alice's bottom line is. There's a chance you could get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer gives you some negotiating room.  750,000 is a substantial discount, but still leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you still have room for improvement. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get the price lower. You've already shown Alice that you're serious about negotiating, and she's lowered her price.  It's likely she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved from $1,000,000 to $900,000.  A counteroffer of $800,000 shows you're willing to compromise, but still trying to get a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground that might be appealing to Alice."
