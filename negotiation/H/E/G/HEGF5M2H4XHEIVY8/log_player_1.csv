Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation space while still reflecting the product's value to me.  I'll gauge Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go higher, and the risk of further negotiation taking too long outweighs the potential for a slightly better price. Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $15,000, which is my guaranteed minimum."
