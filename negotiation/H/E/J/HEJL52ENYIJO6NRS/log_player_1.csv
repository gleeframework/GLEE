Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than his first offer, it's still below what I'm willing to settle for. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us, and I hope it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too low for me. It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'd rather not risk a lengthy negotiation that might result in an even lower offer.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, selling to him is the best option to maximize my profit."
