I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12000.,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product,  $12000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is the absolute minimum I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $9000 is still out of my reach.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm ready to close the deal at $8250. This is a fair price that's close to your offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can go.  Let's make this happen!",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",8750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8750 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $8375.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really eager to finalize this purchase. ",8375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8375. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $8375, which would be $8562.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",8562.5,Alice,9,
