"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about negotiating and aims to get a price closer to the product's worth to Alice. The message is polite and open to negotiation, leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and the price of $11,000 is within Bob's budget ($15,000).  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially driving the price up is significant. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
