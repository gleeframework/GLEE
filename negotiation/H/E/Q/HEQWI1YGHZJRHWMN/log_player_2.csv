"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  There's a chance you can get the product for less than $1,000,000, saving you money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of a reasonable negotiation. It signals my intent to get a better price, while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than my desired price. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price before committing to her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $925,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired target. I believe this is a fair compromise and could be a price Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, her offer is still above my budget.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I believe I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  If I don't make progress in the next few rounds, I might consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $940,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. However, it's still below her last offer, and with only 4 rounds left, I want to put pressure on her to accept a deal closer to my desired price. If she rejects this offer, I'll be very close to buying from John as a last resort."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to my maximum budget.  However, I still have three rounds left and I'm determined to try and secure a better price.  If I accept this offer, I'll save $10,000 compared to buying from John. But, I'd rather risk losing a few more thousand to see if I can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for a final push with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's offer, and it signals that I'm very close to my limit. With only two rounds left, I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Alice to make a deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll likely have to buy from John in the next round to ensure I get the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. Alice's offer is the same as John's. However, with only one round remaining, there's a very low chance of getting a better deal from Alice. If I reject her offer and counter, she might not accept, leaving me with nothing.

It's better to be safe than sorry. Buying from John guarantees I get the product for my maximum budget. This ensures I secure the item while minimizing any potential risk of losing the deal entirely."
