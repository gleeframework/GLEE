"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets a high baseline for negotiations. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is more than Bob's valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like I'm not serious about selling.
* **Setting a Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and confident tone in my message to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **I have more time and leverage.** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup.** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000. 
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  It's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures I close the deal and secure a profit. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll get even more stubborn, and I might not be able to get a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob completely break down.  

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision. It secures a good profit, closes the deal, and minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale.**"
