"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm confident that the product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there.",9500.0,Alice,5,
