"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our unique product which holds significant value to me. Given its importance, I believe it's worth more than what others might perceive. Considering its true worth and the benefits it could bring to you, I am offering this product to you for $9,500. This price reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and your perceived worth, while also allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of its significance to me. I trust that this offer will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $9,500."
