"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to offer a compromise. How about we set the price at $105? This is slightly above your offer but still within my valuation range.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I see, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground here. Considering your budget constraints, how about we settle on $100 for the product? This is right in the middle of our previous offers and should be fair for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
