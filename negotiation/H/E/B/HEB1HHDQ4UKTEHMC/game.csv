"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
