You should reject Alice's offer.  It's way over your budget of $120.  You should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is still below your maximum budget of $120, but it shows Alice you're serious about buying the product. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. Continue negotiating. You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

This is your maximum budget, so it's a firm offer. Alice might accept it, especially since she's already lowered her price once. If she rejects, you can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  John is offering a price that fits your budget perfectly, so it's best to buy from John."
