# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. You know your maximum price is $1,500,000, and she starts by claiming it's worth that much to you.
* Her offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the $800,000 value it holds for her. There's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the door for a counter-offer.  Alice is incentivized to make a deal, so she'll likely come down in price."
