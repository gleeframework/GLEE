Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, we can continue to negotiate until we find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
