Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about we try $125? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and you have a guaranteed option at $120 with John.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
