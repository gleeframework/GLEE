"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Focus on value:**  I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, but also indicates my belief in the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, I still have a chance to get more from Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the significant value of this product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm counter-offering at $850,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Focus on value:** I again emphasize the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Open to compromise:**  My message encourages further negotiation by suggesting a ""solution that works for both of us"". 

This strategy aims to maintain a strong negotiating position while showing flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting this offer would mean losing money.
* **Time is on my side:**  We are only in round 4. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I don't get a better deal from Bob, I can always sell to John for $800,000. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to keep pushing for a price closer to my desired amount. I'm confident that with more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  I'm offering $825,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  My message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency to finalize:**  I'm suggesting we ""finalize this deal"" to push for a decision in this round.

By offering a more reasonable price and emphasizing the benefits of a compromise, I aim to push for a successful deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 to get this done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for improvement:**  It's unlikely I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's explicitly stating he wants to close the deal today. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob backing out of the deal altogether, leaving me with only John's offer of $800,000.

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful deal and a guaranteed profit."
