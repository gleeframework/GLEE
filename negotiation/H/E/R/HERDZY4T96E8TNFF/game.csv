"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value to me. I look forward to your response!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that considers your needs while still being reasonable for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between what I'm willing to pay and what you're asking. I hope we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there with $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?  I believe this price is fair and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,
