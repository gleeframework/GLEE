"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
