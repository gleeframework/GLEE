# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?

You have three options:

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $140. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate the willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $130 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135?  This would still give you a good price, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $150. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
