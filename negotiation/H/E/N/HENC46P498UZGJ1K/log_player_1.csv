"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets the tone for the negotiation and allows for potential compromise. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal. I believe that there's room for compromise, and I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still keeps the price above John's offer of $800,000, ensuring I'm getting a better deal.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as it matches John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
