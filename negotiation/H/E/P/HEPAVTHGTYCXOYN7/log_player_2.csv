"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you and Alice is willing to sell it for $12,000, there's no immediate advantage to buying it from her.  You can try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer. If that fails, you can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bit aggressive but gives you a good starting point.  You're offering $10,500, which is still more than the product is worth to Alice.  This allows for some room for negotiation while also maximizing your potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  You can save $500 by accepting this offer. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and you having to buy from John at the higher price outweighs the potential gains."
