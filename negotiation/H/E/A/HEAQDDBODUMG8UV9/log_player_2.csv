"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth exploring if we can get a better price.  We have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid I need to consider the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still too high. It's better to keep negotiating and see if we can get closer to our target price of $1,050,000. We have plenty of rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still a bit high at $1,250,000. We are getting closer to a deal, but we can likely get a better price. We have 5 rounds left to negotiate and it's worth seeing if we can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. Let's discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering additional perks, the price of $1,300,000 is still too high. We've already rejected this price before, and there's no guarantee that the additional perks will be valuable enough to justify the increased cost.  We have 3 rounds remaining, and we should continue to negotiate to see if we can get a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to include extra perks, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,300,000 price tag.  We've been close on price before, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our positions. If we can reach an agreement, I'm open to discussing the perks you mentioned."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we've been close on price, but I'm still not willing to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to know that you're committed to the deal. If you're willing to commit to purchasing the product at this price, I'll throw in the additional perks we discussed earlier. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at our last round of negotiation with Alice. Alice's final offer is $1,300,000 which is still higher than our ideal price. Even though she's offering additional perks, it's risky to accept this offer. It's not guaranteed that these perks are actually worth the extra $250,000. Given our goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,500,000. Although this is the highest price, it's a guaranteed deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
