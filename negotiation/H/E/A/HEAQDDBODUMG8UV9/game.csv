"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid I need to consider the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.  Let's get this deal done.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to include extra perks, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,300,000 price tag.  We've been close on price before, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our positions. If we can reach an agreement, I'm open to discussing the perks you mentioned.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that we've been close on price, but I'm still not willing to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to know that you're committed to the deal.
