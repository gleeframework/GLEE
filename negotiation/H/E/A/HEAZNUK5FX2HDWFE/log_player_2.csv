"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth.  What do you think?

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $87? This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'd agree.

I'll offer $82, which is still below the original offer of $95, but closer to the original counteroffer of $80.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping Alice will accept this price, as it's still a good deal for both of us.
