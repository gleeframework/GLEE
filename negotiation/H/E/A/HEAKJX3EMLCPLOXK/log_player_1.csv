Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price of $125.  This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer. Since I'm already at my minimum price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'll sell the product to John for $100 to avoid any further loss of time."
