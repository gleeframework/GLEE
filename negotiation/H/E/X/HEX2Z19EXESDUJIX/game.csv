"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8,500 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,000?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
