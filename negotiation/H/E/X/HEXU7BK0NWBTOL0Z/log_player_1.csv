Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but I need to stay within my limits.

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,150,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
