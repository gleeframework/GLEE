Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still lower than buying from John for $1,000,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's getting closer to his maximum price and there's no guarantee Alice will lower her offer further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's still within his budget."
