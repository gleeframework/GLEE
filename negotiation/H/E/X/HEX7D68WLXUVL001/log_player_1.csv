Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a significant profit for me.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential for a deal that benefits us both.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000, acknowledging Bob's interest while still aiming for a higher profit than selling to John.  This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
