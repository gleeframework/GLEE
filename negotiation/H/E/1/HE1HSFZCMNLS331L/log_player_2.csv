"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal quickly. He's offering $9,000, which is still below his maximum budget and leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but is also trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 isn't quite what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price and can potentially still negotiate a better deal. There's still room to counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and its value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he won't go any higher. He's hoping this final offer will be accepted to avoid buying from John."
