"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
