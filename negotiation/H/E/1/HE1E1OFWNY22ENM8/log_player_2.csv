"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can get the product for less than $12,000, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.

You're getting a good deal at $11,000, saving you $4,000 compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting Alice's offer."
