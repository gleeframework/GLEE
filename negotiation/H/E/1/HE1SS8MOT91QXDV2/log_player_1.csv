"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately lose out on a significant portion of my desired profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm hoping to get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $12,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal at this point, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to $11,500.  This is a clear sign to Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
``` 

I'm making a slight counteroffer to Bob at $11,200. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob to accept the deal. It's getting late in the game, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to get a deal done. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. We're in the final rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  While I would have liked to secure a higher price from Bob, John is a guaranteed sale and will allow me to reach my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
