Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000. How about we try $1,062,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and I'm comfortable with this offer.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal for both of us."
