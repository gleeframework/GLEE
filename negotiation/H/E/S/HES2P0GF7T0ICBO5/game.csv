"That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little out of my range.  How about $110?  I'm really keen on getting this product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
