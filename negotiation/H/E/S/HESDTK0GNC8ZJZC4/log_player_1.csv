Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My goal:** Maximize my profit.
* **Bob's value:** $1,200,000
* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000 (John's offer)

By offering $1,150,000, I am:

* **Giving Bob a significant discount** from his perceived value, making the offer attractive.
* **Securing a profit** higher than my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
