# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product holds a lot of value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, $16,000 is still more than his budget. He should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $12,000 is still lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about $14,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, it's still over Bob's budget. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best deal available."
