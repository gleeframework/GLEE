{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I've already negotiated for 9 rounds and it's clear he's not willing to go any higher. John's offer is guaranteed, and I don't want to risk losing a sale in the final round.  It's a little disappointing, but it's the safest option."
