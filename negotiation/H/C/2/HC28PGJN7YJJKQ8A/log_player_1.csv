"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it holds immense value, and this price reflects that.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $1,000,000, I establish a high initial value and create room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's potential value to Bob to make him consider the price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in a dialogue. 

**Note:**  This is just the starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up in price.  
* **Risk Assessment:**  While $800,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can achieve a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the potential value of this product.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price, but not by a significant amount. This shows flexibility while still demonstrating the value of the product.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the potential value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Framing:**  I frame my counteroffer as a ""significant discount"" and a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing.
* **Call to Action:** I urge Bob to finalize the deal to encourage a quick resolution. 

**Strategy:** By slightly reducing my offer, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and hopefully get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While closer to my goal, $920,000 is still below my ideal price, and I'm not yet ready to settle. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm confident that I can still push for a better deal, especially since I have several rounds remaining.
* **Weighing Options:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can achieve a higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially influence him to raise his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In round 5, I will carefully consider Bob's behavior and my remaining time to determine my next counteroffer. If Bob continues to offer lower prices, I might be forced to lower my expectations. However, I'll still try to maximize my earnings within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $935,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value and potential of this product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount to show flexibility while still staying within my desired range.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Framing:**  I frame my offer as a ""significant reduction"" and a ""fair"" compromise to make it more appealing.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  I'm trying to push for a quick resolution by emphasizing a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer is a calculated move aimed at:

* **Testing Bob's limits:**  By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's counteroffer, I'm trying to see if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Closing the gap:**  This is my last chance to negotiate a better price before considering the $800,000 offer from John. 
* **Maintaining control:**  By rejecting Bob's last offer, I've demonstrated that I'm not willing to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not there yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer of $915,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still lower than my desired target.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to secure a significantly better price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer of $800,000 is a safe and reliable option.  While it's not ideal, it's a guaranteed deal with no risk of further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed sale over the possibility of a slightly higher price with Bob. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** The remaining rounds are too few to justify the potential risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Cutting Losses:**  While it's not my ideal outcome, I'm willing to accept the $800,000 to avoid losing out on a potential deal altogether."
