"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product. Let's make this deal!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $112.50? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
