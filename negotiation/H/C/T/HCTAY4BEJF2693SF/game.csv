I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it?,180.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $120.  If that's not possible, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $140. Is that a price you'd be willing to pay?",140.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal at $120. That's my absolute limit,  but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,,
