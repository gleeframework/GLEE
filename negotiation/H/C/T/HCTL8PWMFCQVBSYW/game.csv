,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay the full $950,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is around $800,000 to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $925,000. This price acknowledges the value to both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $800,000 to you.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your ongoing interest in the product. However,  $875,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's try $900,000. This price represents a fair compromise, considering the value this product offers for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
