"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate downwards.  
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  Reminding Bob of the value he receives helps make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000, but I want to see if Bob will bite at a higher number first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's close to my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While I'm not happy with his offer, it's clear that Bob is interested in the product. There's room for negotiation.
* **Time to counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $1,700,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Highlight the value to Bob:** I emphasize that even at $1,700,000, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement but also that I won't accept a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price represents a considerable increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's an increase, $1,000,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Selling to John is a better option:** At this point, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures I meet my minimum requirement.  
* **No need to counter further:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer isn't close enough to warrant more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still far from a price that reflects the true value of this product. While I'm open to further negotiations, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price allows Bob to gain value while I still get a fair return.
* **Maintain negotiation stance:**  I want to leave the door open for further rounds, but I'm firmly set on a price above $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer and reflects my sincere desire to purchase this product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on it. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is the best option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a sure thing and guarantees I achieve my minimum desired profit.
* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal with John by continuing negotiations with Bob."
