"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the savings it offers you compared to your asking price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good deal for you compared to the $1,000,000 you could pay if you were to buy it from John. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your original price and a great opportunity for you to sell it quickly. Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is still a good compromise between our initial offers. This price reflects the value I place on the product and the urgency I have to sell it.
