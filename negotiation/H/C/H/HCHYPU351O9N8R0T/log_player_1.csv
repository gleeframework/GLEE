Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,200,000 (her fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to be made.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to capture as much of that potential profit as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this strategy makes sense:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering it for $1,200,000 (Alice's minimum) would be leaving a significant portion of the potential profit untapped.
* **Greed Can Backfire:** Asking for too much (close to $1,500,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer and forcing Alice to accept the lower price from John.
* **The Power of Negotiation:**  There's always room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but this starting point gives Alice a strong position to potentially secure a final price closer to $1,350,000 or even higher. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Alice could start higher or lower depending on her risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's negotiating style."
