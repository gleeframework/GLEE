"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to offer the product for $9,750, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,5,
