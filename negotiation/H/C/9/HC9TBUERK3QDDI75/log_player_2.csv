"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range for both parties. The message also emphasizes the potential value of the product to Alice,  encouraging her to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating, aiming to bring the price down further. There's still room for compromise and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. By suggesting a split of the difference, I aim to find a mutually agreeable solution and move closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to offer the product for $9,750, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $1,750 higher than my preferred price. I've already made a significant effort to negotiate and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $8,000. It saves me a substantial amount of money and avoids further negotiation rounds that may not yield a better outcome."
