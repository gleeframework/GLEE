Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $115.  I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful to you."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) and potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can sell to John for my minimum price and still make a profit."
