Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe the value is far greater than the asking price.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for this product,  which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is still below that. It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,700,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking for something closer to $1,850,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This product holds exceptional value, and I believe this price reflects that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1750000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
