"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $7,500 is a good price, he can likely do better. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $7,000 for the product?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $7,250 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $7,250 is a good price, and it's likely that he won't be able to get a lower price from Alice.  He also knows he can buy it from John for $8,000, so this is a better deal."
