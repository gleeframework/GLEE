``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation but also signaling my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob and see if I can secure a better counteroffer or sell to John for my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  That's a step in the right direction.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750 for the product?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I believe I can push for a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob and see if I can secure a better counteroffer or sell to John for my desired price."

I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,875.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8875}
