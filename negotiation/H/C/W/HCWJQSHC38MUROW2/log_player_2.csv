"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can still do better. He has a guaranteed alternative with John for $8,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the best possible price and John's offer of $8,000 remains a viable option.  Alice has come down slightly, but $9,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay at this point. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before potentially accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  That's a step in the right direction.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750 for the product?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,875.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $8,875 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still a bit higher than his absolute limit.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases, it's more efficient for Bob to take the sure thing and purchase from John."
