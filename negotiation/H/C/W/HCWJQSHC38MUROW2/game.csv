"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  That's a step in the right direction.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750 for the product?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,875.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8875.0,Alice,5,
