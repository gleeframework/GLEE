"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,275,000? This reflects the product's worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
