Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is my absolute lowest price. If you can accept that, we can finalize the deal.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $14,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $8,000 is the best way to maximize your savings."
