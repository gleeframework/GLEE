Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your ideal price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to assess Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. If he negotiates, you have room to work with.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
