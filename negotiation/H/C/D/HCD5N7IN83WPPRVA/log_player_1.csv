"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I won't accept anything less than my minimum price of $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $17,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm holding out for a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $16,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm running out of time, but I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. I'll counter with a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. It's still a good profit for me, but it's also a fair price considering Bob's value for the product. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer. If not, I'll have to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob finally met my minimum price! I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal. It's been a tough negotiation, but I managed to secure a good price for the product."
