"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. It's the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Can you meet me at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
