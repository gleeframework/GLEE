It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $850,000."

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on and shows you're serious about getting a better price."

This counteroffer is a compromise - a slightly higher price than your previous offer, but still a substantial saving compared to Alice's latest offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining your desired price point."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000

Alice has come down to $765,000, which is a good price considering you can buy from John for $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or John's price changing makes accepting her offer the best option at this point."
