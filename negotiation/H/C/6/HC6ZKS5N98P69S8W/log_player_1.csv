{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
