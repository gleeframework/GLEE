"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $120 limit, especially knowing John offers a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite & Direct:**  The message is respectful while clearly stating the price is too high and proposing an alternative.
* **Strategic Goal:**  The aim is to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a deal significantly below your $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met your target price! There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further since you've reached your goal of getting the best possible price. Accepting now secures the deal."
