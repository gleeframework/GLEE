"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of the product. However,  $1,450,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I can come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground. To be frank, $1,400,000 is already a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. However, I value closing this deal with you. Let's meet in the middle - $1,387,500. This is my final offer.",1387500.0,Alice,5,
