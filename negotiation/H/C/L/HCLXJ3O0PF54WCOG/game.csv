"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it can offer you. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly valuable and can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While the product is valuable, $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This seems like a fair deal to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
