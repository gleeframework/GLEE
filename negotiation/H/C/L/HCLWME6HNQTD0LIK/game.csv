"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115?",115.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $125, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $122? It's still a good price for you, and I'll include some additional perks.",122.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $125, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. How about we meet at $121? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to throw in one more extra to sweeten the deal.",121.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $120. I think we've been negotiating long enough, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one final offer: $120. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to buy from someone else.",120.0,Bob,10,
