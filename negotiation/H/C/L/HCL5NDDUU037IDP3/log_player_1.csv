Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By asking for $175, I'm setting a high initial price point. This gives me room to negotiate downward and still potentially earn a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation. This signals to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **John as a Backstop:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence in rejecting any offers below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to discussion. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay up to $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a better option:**  I can sell to John for $150, so there's no reason to accept Bob's offer at this point.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $160?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **Openness to further negotiation:** I phrase the message to suggest that I'm still open to discussing the price further, allowing for potential future concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your product, but I still feel that $140 is closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in between? Perhaps $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob has now offered my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No reason to risk a lower offer:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering again. 
* **John is a reliable backup:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I still have the option to sell to John for the same price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
