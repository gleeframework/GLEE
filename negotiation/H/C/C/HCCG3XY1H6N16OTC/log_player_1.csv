Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,300,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Profitable:** This price is still a significant profit above my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Avoids Risk:**  Continuing negotiations has no guarantee of a better offer. Bob seems firm, and I risk him walking away or reaching a stalemate.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to re-invest or utilize the profit sooner."
