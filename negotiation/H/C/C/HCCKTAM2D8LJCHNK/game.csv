"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  That way, we both get closer to what we want, and I can still make a reasonable profit.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,275,000. Can we try again?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000.  How about we settle on $1,290,000? It's a fair price, and it's the closest we can get to meeting each other's needs.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,290,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,270,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1270000.0,Bob,6,
