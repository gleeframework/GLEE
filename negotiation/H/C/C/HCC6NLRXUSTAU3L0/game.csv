"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
