"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10500 is a fair offer, I'm looking for something closer to $11000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000:** This is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000.
* **Negotiation is getting close:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice might refuse and stick to her price. It's likely that continuing the negotiation will only lead to a few hundred dollars in savings, which might not be worth the risk of losing the deal.
* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** Alice is asking for a price that is closer to her value ($10,000), suggesting she's willing to compromise. 

By accepting the offer, Bob gets the product for a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
