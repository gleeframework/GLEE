Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without making you feel like you're giving away too much.
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate that you believe in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely still get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to bridge the gap."
