"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in your product but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase work within my budget.  Let's get this deal done!",10500.0,Bob,4,
