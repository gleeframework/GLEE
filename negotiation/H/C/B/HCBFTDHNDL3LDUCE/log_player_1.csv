"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in your product but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. $10,000 is too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase work within my budget.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,500 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
