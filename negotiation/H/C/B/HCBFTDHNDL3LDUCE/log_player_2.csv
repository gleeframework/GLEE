"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can explore a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in your product but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a better price.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and polite,  acknowledging Alice's offer while clearly stating Bob's desired price point.  
* **Strategic Consideration:** Bob knows he has limited rounds and needs to strike a balance between getting a good price and not letting the opportunity slip away.  A $10,000 offer is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, but still not ideal.**  While $11,000 is lower than the initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further and get closer to his $10,000 target.
* **Rejecting keeps the negotiation going.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob maintains leverage and avoids making a decision he might regret later. 
* **Rounds are limited, but Bob still has time.**  With 7 rounds remaining, there's ample opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase work within my budget.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob is offering $10,500, which is a compromise between his previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $11,000.  This shows Bob is serious about buying while still striving for a good price.
* **Message:** The message is positive and upbeat, emphasizing the ""fair"" aspect of the offer and urging Alice to close the deal.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  Bob is getting closer to his target price and demonstrating flexibility.  He has 6 rounds left, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
