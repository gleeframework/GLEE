Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I secure a sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value Bob gets at a lower price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate down if Bob counters, but I'm still above my minimum value.
* **Prepared for rejection:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with a counteroffer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees the highest profit, but it also eliminates the opportunity to potentially get more from Bob.  I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to try and maximize my earnings.

**Next move:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise around $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the fact that $950,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Maintaining a buffer:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, allowing room for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I reject and counteroffer, there's a high chance Bob will also reject. This could lead to a long negotiation with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the safest and most profitable option at this point.  

By selling to John, I guarantee a profit that meets my minimum requirements.  While I might have been able to negotiate a slightly better price with Bob, the risk of further concessions and a prolonged negotiation isn't worth the potential reward."
