"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $14000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another option.",15000.0,Bob,6,
