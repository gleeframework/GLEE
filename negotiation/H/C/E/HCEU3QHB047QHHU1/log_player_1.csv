Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes value and exclusivity while creating a sense of urgency.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting higher allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  

**Why this is better than offering at Bob's valuation:**

While offering at $1,000,000 guarantees the sale, it leaves potential profit on the table. This approach seeks to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing Alice's profit."
