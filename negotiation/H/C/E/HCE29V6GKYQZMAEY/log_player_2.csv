"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000 less from John ($15,000) than from Alice's current offer ($14,000). It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that is still higher than Alice's value for the product ($12,000) but lower than my current best alternative ($15,000 from John). This gives Alice some incentive to accept, while still saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if I can get a lower price. If Alice is willing to negotiate, I may be able to get the product for less than $14,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $500 higher than my previous offer, so I'm offering a compromise by increasing my price by $500. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price. There's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice since I can get the product from John for the same price.  It's time to move on and avoid any further potential delays."
