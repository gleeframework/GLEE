Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit. 
* **Strategic Message:**  The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob and frames the offer as a win-win scenario. This increases the chances of acceptance and avoids an immediate rejection.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and either accept it (if it's closer to my desired price) or make a counter-counteroffer.
* **If Negotiations Stall:** I'll be prepared to fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1000000. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially get closer to that value. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider how much lower I'm willing to go. 
* I'll craft a counter-offer that is persuasive and potentially sweetens the deal for Bob (perhaps offering a small concession on a related aspect). 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm proposing a price of $975,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and it still allows you to get a great deal. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground, offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still below my initial price.
* **Persuasive Message:** I emphasize the compromise I'm making and reiterate the value Bob will receive. This is intended to make the offer more appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message concludes with a call to action, suggesting that a deal is within reach.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've achieved a good price and a successful negotiation.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll assess Bob's potential counter-offer and decide whether to accept or make a final offer. I'll also weigh the risks against John's offer of $1,200,000."
