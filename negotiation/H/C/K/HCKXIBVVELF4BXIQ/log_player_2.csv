"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to purchase it at a special introductory price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit. He has already shown willingness to pay $10,500, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,750? This would be a good compromise, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $10,900 for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not securing the product increases.  

Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take that option now rather than risking further negotiations with Alice."
