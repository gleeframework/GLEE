Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob might lead to a quicker sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Attractive but Realistic:** $11,000 is a substantial markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This initial offer allows some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, potentially driving the price even higher. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale over maximizing profit, you might adjust the offer."
