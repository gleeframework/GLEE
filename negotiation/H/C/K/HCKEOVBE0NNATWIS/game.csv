"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and the potential it holds.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Bob,4,
