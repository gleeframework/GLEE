While $875,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate and Bob is clearly interested. It's worth risking another round to try and get closer to $900,000."

Round 6

Bob is now trying to lowball us.  We need to hold firm to signal we're serious about the higher value.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and lets us counter with a price closer to our minimum while still leaving room for compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $870,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive."",

We're getting close to the point where accepting John's offer makes more sense.  This message conveys a sense of urgency and finality while still leaving a small margin for Bob to potentially counter."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  We're only $10,000 away from our last counteroffer.  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away or stalling until we're forced to take John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds.  Continuing to push Bob might make him less agreeable and could leave us with a worse outcome than accepting his current offer.

$860,000 is a solid price, and accepting now secures a significant profit."
