(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring better deals before committing.  $8,000 is a good price, but we can try to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy.  Alice might reject this, but it sets a lower anchor price for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is still a good deal, we've already established a lower price point.  By rejecting, we can continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving incrementally closer to Alice's previous offer.  This shows we're serious about buying, but still looking for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to Alice's original offer.  While we're willing to pay more than our first counteroffer, it's still worth trying to squeeze out a little more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  This offer splits the difference between our last counteroffer and her latest offer. We're showing flexibility and are almost at a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where we're getting close to Alice's initial offer, and rejecting could risk her getting frustrated and walking away. At $9,500, we're still getting a significant discount from John's price, and we're only a few rounds away from the potential risk of having to buy from John at $10,000."
