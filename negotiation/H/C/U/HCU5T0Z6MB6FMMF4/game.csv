"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $170?  This is a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $155, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
