Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $987,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's unlikely he'll reach a point that significantly surpasses John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
