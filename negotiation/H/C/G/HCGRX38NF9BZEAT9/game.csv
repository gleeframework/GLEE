"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the extras, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $90? That's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the extras, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I can do $100, which is my absolute minimum, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to make it worth your while.",100.0,Alice,5,
