Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is well outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,600,000 is still out of reach. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can't exceed $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can go. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
