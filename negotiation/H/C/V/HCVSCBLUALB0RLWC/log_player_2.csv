"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. There are 9 more rounds, so Bob has time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $850,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates Bob's serious intent to purchase while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer.  Bob knows Alice is willing to negotiate, and since there are more rounds available, it makes sense to continue trying to get a lower price.  He can make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His counteroffer is higher than his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still significantly lower than Alice's price. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to meet halfway and potentially close the deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, showing that she is willing to compromise.  However, Bob is still hoping to get a lower price. He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target price.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's last offer. Offering $890,000 shows a genuine attempt to bridge the gap and encourages Alice to consider a deal. With fewer rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a move that could potentially close the deal. He's still aiming for a good discount but recognizes the need to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. However, with only three rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic.  Rejection allows him to make a counteroffer and see if he can push Alice closer to his target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a significant move. He's offering $900,000, which is only $30,000 less than Alice's current offer. This shows a strong desire to close the deal. With only two rounds left, Bob needs to make a compelling counteroffer that Alice might be willing to accept.  He's willing to pay a bit more, hoping it will push Alice to agree, especially with time running out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, and there is only one round remaining.  At this point, it's unlikely that Bob can get a significantly lower price.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 than to risk a final round that may result in a higher price or no deal at all.  Bob is guaranteed to get the product from John and will avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
