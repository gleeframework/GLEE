Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to my minimum value.  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or counters, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is still significantly higher than what Bob offered but closer to a potential deal. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him to guarantee a profit."
