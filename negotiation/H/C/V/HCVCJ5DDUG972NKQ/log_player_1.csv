"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm aiming high to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 

I'll analyze Bob's response to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss.

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob, as I have 6 rounds remaining. There's still potential to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John at this point would only yield a moderate profit compared to the possibility of a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is another compromise, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe this price is a fair compromise and hopefully, Bob will see its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob as I have 4 rounds left. With only 4 rounds left, selling to John will provide a guaranteed profit. However, I am still hoping that I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a very close to my minimum acceptable price. With only three rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in order to get the best price. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a slightly higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. While I could counteroffer one more time, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a profit and ensures I don't lose out on a potential deal. It's the most logical decision at this point."
