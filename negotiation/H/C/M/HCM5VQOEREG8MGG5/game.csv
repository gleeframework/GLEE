"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by offering it to you for $16,500, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Alice,5,
