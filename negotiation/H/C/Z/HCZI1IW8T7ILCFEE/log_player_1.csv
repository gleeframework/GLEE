"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle ground, leaving room for negotiation but also demonstrating the value I place on the product.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, keeping the conversation going. 
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware of the John option, giving me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations stall or if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I think we can come to a better agreement. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob because I believe I can achieve a better price.  
* **Room for Compromise:** I have 8 rounds left.  There's still ample opportunity for us to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and focuses on the key points: price and value. 
* **Open for Further Discussion:** I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer, but also provide a strong starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 above my minimum value. While it's tempting, I'm confident we can still achieve a better price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample opportunity to push for a higher price.  
* **Seeking Compromise:**  My goal is to find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below the product's worth to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $875,000 is still a bit low. How about $890,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a great deal while ensuring I meet my own minimum requirements.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount ($15,000) to show a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I frame the offer as a fair compromise, highlighting the benefits for both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I subtly introduce a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's try to close this deal,"" hoping to encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I still have room to negotiate further if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $885,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $85,000 below the product's worth to him, and it's only $5,000 below my minimum value. 
* **Limited Time:** We are now in round 6, meaning there are only 4 rounds left. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might lower his offer further, or even walk away entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit of $85,000.

Considering the potential downsides of further negotiation and the limited rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
