"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs. This price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
