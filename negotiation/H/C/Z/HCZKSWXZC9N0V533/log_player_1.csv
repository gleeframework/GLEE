"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, but still considerably more than my minimum selling price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.
