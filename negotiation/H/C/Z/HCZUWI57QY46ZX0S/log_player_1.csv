Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  The ideal price is somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.  You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000, which is still a substantial incentive. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or accept his counter-offer.
* **Know Your Walk-Away Point:** Never lose sight of your $1,000,000 guarantee from John. If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a secure alternative."
