"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering me. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
