Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than nothing, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $14,500 is still a bit below my minimum.  I've already had a good back-and-forth with him, and I'm not confident we'll get any closer to an agreement.  I'll go ahead and sell to John for $15,000."
