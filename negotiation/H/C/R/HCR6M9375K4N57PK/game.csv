"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
