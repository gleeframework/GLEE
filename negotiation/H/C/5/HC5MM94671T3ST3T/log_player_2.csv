"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to my limit, I still have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further before I resort to buying from John at my absolute maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?  I'm ready to buy if you're okay with that price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice. 
* **Show willingness to buy:**  By stating ""I'm ready to buy if you're okay with that price,"" I signal that I'm serious and motivated, which might encourage Alice to agree to a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down in price, but $8,500 is still above my ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for one more counteroffer to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. It meets Alice halfway between her offer of $8,500 and my previous offer of $8,000.
* **Final offer implication:**  By phrasing it as ""How about we settle..."", I'm subtly implying this is my final offer, encouraging Alice to accept.  
* **Still below John's price:** Importantly, this counteroffer keeps me below my alternative option of buying from John for $8,000."
