"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $10,900? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's also close to my ideal selling point.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,900. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10700.0,Bob,6,
