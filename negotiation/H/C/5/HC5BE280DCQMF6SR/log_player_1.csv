"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $10,750. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $10,900? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's also close to my ideal selling point."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,900. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm starting to run out of time. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and ending up with $10,000 from John. So, I'm going to accept his offer of $10,700."
