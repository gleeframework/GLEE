(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has negotiated down significantly from Alice's initial offer, and the price is getting close to his target. It's time to accept the offer.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and secures the product."
