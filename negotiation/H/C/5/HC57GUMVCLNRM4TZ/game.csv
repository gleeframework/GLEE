"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This price would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still saving me a considerable amount of money. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $920000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product, while also being reasonable for you. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to your offer, and still allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but unfortunately, $950000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This would be a good compromise for both of us - you'd be closer to your desired price, and I'd be able to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
