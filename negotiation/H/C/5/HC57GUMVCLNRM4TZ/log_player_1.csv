Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This price would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still saving me a considerable amount of money. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
