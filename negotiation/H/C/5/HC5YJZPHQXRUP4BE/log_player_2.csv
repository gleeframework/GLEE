Given its high worth to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exceptional price of $10,000. This offer not only ensures you secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate but also allows me to maximize the return on our investment.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price."
