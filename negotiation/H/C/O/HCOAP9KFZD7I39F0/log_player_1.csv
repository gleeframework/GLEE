Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but that's as low as I can go at this point.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get a better price than $1,400,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I've only got 4 rounds left.  I'm running the risk of losing out on a sale if I keep rejecting, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
