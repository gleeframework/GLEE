"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I can try to get a better price from Alice. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
``` 
I'm going to start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give me some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer of $60 is within my budget and a good deal. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and potentially losing the chance to buy from John."
