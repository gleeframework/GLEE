"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $825000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $790000, but I think that's the maximum I can offer. Can you consider that?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $790000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $820000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $795000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Can you consider that?",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $795000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $825000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $825000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm making a final offer of $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,10,
