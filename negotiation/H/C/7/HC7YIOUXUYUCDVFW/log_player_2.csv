"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity considering its value to you is $15,000. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can aim for a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? It's still a great deal for you, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Instead of accepting the full $15,000 value, I can offer you the product for $11,000. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's revised offer of $11,000 is a good deal for me. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and it's close to my initial counteroffer of $10,000. Accepting this offer allows me to save a good amount of money while still securing the product I need."
