"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He's aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is $150,000 over his target. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob should aim for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price. The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's goal is now only $100,000, making a counteroffer a reasonable strategy to try and close the gap."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still $125,000 above Bob's target. While they're getting closer, it's clear that further negotiation might not get them to a price Bob is comfortable with. 

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees him the product at his desired price, saving him a significant amount of money compared to continuing negotiations with Alice."
