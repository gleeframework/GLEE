Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $11,999 appears significantly lower than $12,000 in the mind of the buyer, making it more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum."
