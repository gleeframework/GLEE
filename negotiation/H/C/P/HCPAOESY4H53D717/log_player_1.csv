"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $87.50 is a good compromise. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures I make a profit above my minimum."
