"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Target Price in Mind:**  Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to $80 as possible (John's price).  Offering $60 gives you some bargaining space while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit high. You have room to negotiate further, especially knowing John's $80 price is a viable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** Alice made a significant jump down from her $150 offer.  Offering $75 is meeting her halfway between her $90 offer and your initial $60 counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is very close to your $80 fallback (John's price). It puts pressure on Alice, signaling that you have an alternative and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can do $85, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has explicitly stated that $85 is her final offer. 
* **John's price is better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. It makes no financial sense to pay Alice $5 more. 
* **Time saved:** Opting for John's offer ends the negotiation process, saving you potential time and effort."
