"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
