"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to take on the risk of purchasing it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from our previous discussions, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I'm still willing to sell it to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to take on the risk of purchasing it.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to go to $975000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $962500.",962500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $962500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $925000 again.

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit repetitive with the $925000 offer. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $955000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",955000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession to $955000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $925000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",925000.0,Bob,10,
