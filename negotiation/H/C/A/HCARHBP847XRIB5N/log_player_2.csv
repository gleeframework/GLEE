"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below my maximum budget, it's still significantly more than the product is worth to her. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer, but still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating. I can likely get a better price by persisting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $900,000. This would give you a healthy profit and allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. I'm confident this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business, and it's still a significant profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is still higher than what I initially wanted, I've reached a point where it's in my best interest to accept.  Considering:

* **Time:** We're already halfway through the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity entirely. 
* **Value:**  This price is still significantly lower than buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further. 
* **Potential Profit:** Even at $975,000, there's a good chance I can still make a profit based on the value I placed on the product.

Therefore, I'm going to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
