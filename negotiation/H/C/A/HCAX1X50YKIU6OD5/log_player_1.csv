{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and it's important to keep the following in mind:

* **Reasoning:** $130 is a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob is $150 and your minimum is $100. It leaves room for negotiation, while still giving you a good profit.
* **Flexibility:** Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  
* **John's offer:** Always keep John's $100 offer in mind as your safety net. If negotiations with Bob become too tedious or unprofitable, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price.  I want to see if I can nudge him closer to my initial offer before settling for $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 125}
