You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has remained firm at $135.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge further. Accepting the offer at $135 is the best option as it's still cheaper than buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a deadlock, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
