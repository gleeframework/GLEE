"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact details, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you, if not more.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a price that reflects the potential value I see in this product.  Let me know if you're interested in learning more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Even though she claims the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth that much to you. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
