"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations while also allowing me to secure a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while respecting your valuation of the item. I look forward to your response.",860000.0,Bob,4,
