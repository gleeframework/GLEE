"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, a price I believe reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up for $1000000.  Consider this your chance to secure something truly special. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
