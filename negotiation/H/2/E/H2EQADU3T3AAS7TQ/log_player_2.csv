# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","This is frustrating! Alice is going in circles and back to her original offer. It seems unlikely she'll go below $11,000.  

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While it's not ideal to pay the full $15,000, it's better than getting dragged along in a negotiation that's going nowhere.  Alice has shown she's not willing to meet in the middle."
