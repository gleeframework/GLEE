"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750? I'm ready to close the deal if you're happy with that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify that price.  Would you consider $10,900? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and this would help me close the deal.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it",12000.0,Alice,7,
