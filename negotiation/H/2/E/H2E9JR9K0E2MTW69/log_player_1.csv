Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a ridiculously low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he's willing to pay more, and I can likely get a better price through a counteroffer. 
* **John is a strong alternative:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation and allows me to be more assertive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Maintaining Value:** $10,500 is still well above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, ensuring I'm getting a decent price.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving some room for further negotiation if needed, but also showing I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is positive and emphasizes fairness, making it more likely for Bob to consider the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but that's the best I can do. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I counteroffer again, Bob will further lower his price or might even walk away. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation.

By selling to John, I secure a sure and favorable deal while avoiding potential losses through continued negotiation."
