"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but that's the best I can do. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
