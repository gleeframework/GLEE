Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $175 seems a bit steep for me, would you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $140?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about $145? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It seems like we are getting close, Alice.  Would you be willing to do $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum price of $150.  At this point, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
