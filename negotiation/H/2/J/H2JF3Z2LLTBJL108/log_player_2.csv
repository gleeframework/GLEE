"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm confident it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth $1,200,000 to you and $800,000 to Alice, meaning there's a significant margin for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial starting point."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I think this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, we're still above the halfway point between our values. Continuing to negotiate is likely to lead to a lower price, as both of us have room to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? It's closer to the middle ground, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
