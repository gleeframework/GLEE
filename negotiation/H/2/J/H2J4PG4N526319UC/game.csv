"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your concerns regarding the pricing. In light of this, we would like to propose an alternative. For the next two weeks, we are offering our product at $850,000. This is still above market value but aims to meet your financial considerations while ensuring both parties benefit from the transaction. Please let us know if this revised offer suits your needs.",850000.0,Alice,3,
