"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $120?  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $120.  Would you be willing to meet me at $140? That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
