,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you get a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $101.25. This would be a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. What do you think?",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98. Can you meet me at that price?",98.0,Bob,6,
