"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Let's negotiate with Alice.  $120 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too far from my $80 walk-away point. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair deal to me."", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Alice is willing to negotiate, so I'm inching closer to my target. Offering $75 splits the difference between her last offer and mine, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $100. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems like Alice is not willing to budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and go with my alternative option of buying from John for $80."
