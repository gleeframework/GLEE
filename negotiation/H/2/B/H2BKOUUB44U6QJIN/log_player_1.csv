Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin above my minimum value and allows room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $100 offer. I've already made a compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
