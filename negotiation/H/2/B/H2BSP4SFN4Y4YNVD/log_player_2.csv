"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is too high.  While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. You have multiple rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120. It's still a fair price for her, as she values the product at $80.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still too high.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with more negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and continue to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  It's still a good deal for both of us, as it's above Alice's value of $80 but below my maximum budget.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is too close to John's price of $150.  With only a few rounds left, the odds of getting a better deal from Alice are slim.  It's time to cut my losses and purchase from John to ensure I get the product within my budget."
