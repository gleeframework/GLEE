"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $10000 is still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,
