"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget of $150.  I can do better.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$115 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $150. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and I'm comfortable with this price."
