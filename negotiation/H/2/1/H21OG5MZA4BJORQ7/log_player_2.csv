"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and she's asking for $15,000. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your desired maximum. You're only willing to pay $12,000. It's best to reject her offer again and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. My budget remains firm at $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above your budget of $12,000. You've already countered twice, and it seems unlikely she'll budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for your desired price. You've already used 5 rounds, and the risk of further negotiation going south is high.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your price point and saves you potential time and energy."
