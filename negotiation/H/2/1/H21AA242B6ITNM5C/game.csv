"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its value could be significantly higher for the right buyer. I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000. This is a one-time offer and I'm confident you won't find this kind of value elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
