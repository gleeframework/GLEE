You have three options:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120.  My final offer is $145.  I think that's a very fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly not going to budge much below $145. While you might be able to haggle her down a little more, it's very unlikely you'll get her close to your $100 target.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which meets your needs perfectly. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and go with the sure thing."
