"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $170 is still a bit much for me. Could you do $120?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120.  My final offer is $145.  I think that's a very fair price for this product.",145.0,Alice,5,
