"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line. This still gives you a significant profit margin. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. That's the lowest I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
