"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Your Maximum:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, it's likely she won't go much lower considering her valuation of the product."
