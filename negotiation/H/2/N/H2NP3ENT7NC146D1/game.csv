"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I hope you'll consider my offer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's true value. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between our interests.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. I hope you'll reconsider.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.  ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
