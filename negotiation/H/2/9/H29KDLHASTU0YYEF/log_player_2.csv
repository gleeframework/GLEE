"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high. Bob is only willing to spend $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.  There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This offer is a good compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than Bob's budget. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's more beneficial for Bob to go ahead and purchase the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation with Alice."
