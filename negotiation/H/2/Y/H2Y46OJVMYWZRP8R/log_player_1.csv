Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and maintains a profitable position for Alice.
* **Close to Alice's guaranteed price:** Offering it slightly below John's offer ($1,500,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Positive language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, fostering a positive tone for the negotiation. 
 
This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John as a safety net."
