"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your perspective, Bob. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $1,750,000 is still a bit too rich for me. How about we settle around $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the product's real value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
