Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your perspective, Bob. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer but $1,750,000 is still a bit too rich for me. How about we settle around $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the product's real value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $1,600,000 is her final offer. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and above your alternative option with John. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap, making John's offer the most financially sensible choice."
