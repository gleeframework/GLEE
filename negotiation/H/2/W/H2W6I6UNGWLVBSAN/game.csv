"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. It's a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's uniqueness and worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  Let me know if that's something you can consider.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
