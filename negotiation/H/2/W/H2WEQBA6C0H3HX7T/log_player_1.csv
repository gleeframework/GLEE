Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which might sway Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring I won't be stuck with the product if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I am prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, aiming for the highest price he is willing to pay while remaining above my minimum of $8,000."
