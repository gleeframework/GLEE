"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $20000 for it.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price reduction?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you in the middle at $16000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $15500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $15500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14000. Can you consider $14750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of concessions already, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiating. However, I'm willing to make one more move. I can do $16000, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
