"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its high quality and unique features, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your business or lifestyle. Considering its worth, I propose an initial offer of $15000 for the product. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and John is selling the product for that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice as you might end up paying more."
