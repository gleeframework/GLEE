"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to move my price up a bit, how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,012,500?  This is a final offer from me. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
