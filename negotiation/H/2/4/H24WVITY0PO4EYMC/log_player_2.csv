"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $125. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $125 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, you can try to get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get the price closer to $100."
