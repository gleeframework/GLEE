Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially reach a higher price.  However, if he rejects this offer outright, you can quickly pivot to John and secure your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still far below the product's value to him.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price.  It's worth pushing for a better deal, as you're still well above your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point closer to your desired outcome. You're likely to reach an agreement in the next round, but if Bob again rejects, you can consider John's offer or make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than your last offer and is approaching your minimum acceptable price. There is a high likelihood he will continue to lower his offer, potentially leading to a long and unproductive negotiation. 

Selling to John now guarantees you a minimum of $800,000, securing your minimum profit. While it may not be the ideal price, it's a safe and secure option compared to the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
