"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering your offer of $450,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle again at $500,000? I think that's a fair offer.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",525000.0,Alice,5,
