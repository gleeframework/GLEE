"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering your offer of $450,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000.

Alice is clearly trying to get closer to my budget, and $525,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant savings compared to John's offer."
