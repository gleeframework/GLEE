"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $100 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $170 for you.  I believe this product will really benefit you.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $170 is still a bit outside my budget. I could do $110, and I think that's a fair offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to be fair.  Let's split the difference - $140.  It's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for trying to find a middle ground. I appreciate that this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120? That's the highest I can go.",120.0,Bob,6,
