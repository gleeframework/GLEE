"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start with a lower offer, significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to show that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm hoping Alice will counter with a price closer to my offer, and we can then negotiate from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$11,500 is better than Alice's first offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from Round 2, but I'm still keeping it below Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$11,200 is still too high for me.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to overpay. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it's getting close to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept $11,100. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small increase from my last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but I'm not willing to overpay.  If Alice rejects this, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,050.  While that's a good deal, I've reached the point where I'm comfortable paying John $15,000.  I've learned a lot about Alice's negotiating style and I'm happy with the price John is offering."
