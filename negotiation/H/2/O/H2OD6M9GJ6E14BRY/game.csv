"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
