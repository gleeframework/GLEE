Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too much. Let's go with $9,750. It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,750 is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  It's important to get a good price, but also to close the deal.  We have only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
