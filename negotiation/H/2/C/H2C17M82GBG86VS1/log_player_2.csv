"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price, given its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still too high, and he has 9 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is better than her initial offer, he still has time to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. He can counteroffer again and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is a lower price than before, he can still try to negotiate further. He has 5 rounds left, so he has time to counteroffer again and potentially reach a price closer to his target.  It's still risky to accept, as he could potentially get a better price later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too much. Let's go with $9,750. It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
