"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm placing on this product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to potentially reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1400000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1380000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1380000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
