Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1400000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1380000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,380,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1350000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1340000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is very close to your desired price range and is significantly lower than the original asking price. With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely you'll get a much lower price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer or the possibility of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
