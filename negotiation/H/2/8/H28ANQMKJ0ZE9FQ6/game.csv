"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $875000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,6,
