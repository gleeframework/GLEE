Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and what it can do for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. I'm also being positive and emphasizing the product's value to him.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $10,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also holding firm to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get Bob to accept."
