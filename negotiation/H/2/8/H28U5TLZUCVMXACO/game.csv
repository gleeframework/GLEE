"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount on its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
