Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product at a price that reflects its incredible potential. I'm starting at $1,400,000, a price point that gives you a substantial margin for profit. Let's discuss how we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, a price that still allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, a price that still provides you with a solid return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a substantial profit for you. Let's find a solution that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have a reliable backup buyer in John, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950,000 is still a significant gap from what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price point allows for a healthy return on your investment while ensuring I can achieve a fair value for the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer. $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $980,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I also don't want to give up too much. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, as we are getting closer to a potentially acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer.  While $980,000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,015,000.  This price point allows for both of us to make a solid profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1015000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $995,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 2 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to reach my target price.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing my desired value and guaranteeing a successful transaction."
