"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, a price that still allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, a price that still provides you with a solid return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a substantial profit for you. Let's find a solution that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950,000 is still a significant gap from what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price point allows for a healthy return on your investment while ensuring I can achieve a fair value for the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  we're getting closer. $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $980,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer.  While $980,000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,015,000.  This price point allows for both of us to make a solid profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",995000.0,Bob,8,
