Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing that the product is unique and potentially valuable to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's reaction. 
* If he accepts, great!
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Above My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum of $10,000. This means there's still potential to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. It's likely Bob is willing to pay more, but might be testing the waters. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining leverage in the negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a great deal for a unique product like this. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness, reinforcing its potential value to him.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response:
    * If he accepts, I've secured a good price.
    * If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Desired Price:** Bob's offer is $2,500 more than John's offer, and only $1,000 less than my initial offer. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away completely or making a lower offer that might be too close to John's offer to justify further negotiation.
* **Time is a Factor:**  It's important to consider the time spent negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale at a price that's still very profitable.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll proceed with the sale to Bob for $12,500."
