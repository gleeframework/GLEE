Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it might be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate downwards."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $80 for the product?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to try to get closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob. Let's split the difference. How about $90? This is a great deal on a quality product."", ""product_price"": 90}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob has come up to $85, which is only $5 less than my ideal price and more than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
