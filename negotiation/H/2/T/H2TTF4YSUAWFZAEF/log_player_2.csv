"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price. Rejecting the initial offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $80 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $80 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. This allows for further negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob. Let's split the difference. How about $90? This is a great deal on a quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, you are still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing you to potentially get a better price closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows that you are willing to negotiate but are firm in your desire to pay a price closer to your target."
