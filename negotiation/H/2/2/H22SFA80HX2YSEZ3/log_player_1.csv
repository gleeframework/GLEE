Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to maximize profit.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there.  If he rejects, I can then decide whether to lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $15000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to counteroffer and potentially get a higher price, there's no guarantee he'd accept.  Selling to John right away ensures I get my minimum value without risking further negotiation."
