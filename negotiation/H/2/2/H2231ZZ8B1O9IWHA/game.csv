"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I recognize the value you've placed on this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a concession. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
