"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for that price if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will show him I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to sell for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is closer to my target, but still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have 6 rounds left before having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to offer $10,500. This is a small concession from my last offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come up a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,200 is the highest offer Bob has made so far, it's still far from my minimum value. I have 4 rounds remaining and the option to sell to John, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  I believe we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10300}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $10,300. This is another small concession, but it's a show of good faith.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John. I have 3 rounds left before I have to make that decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  His offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I only have two rounds left.  It's more likely that I'll end up selling the product for a price lower than my minimum, which is not ideal.  It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
