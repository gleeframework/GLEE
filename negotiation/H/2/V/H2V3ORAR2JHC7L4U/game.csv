"I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $9000. I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000. Let's try $10000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I can only offer $9500. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm truly hoping we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $12000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
