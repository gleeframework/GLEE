{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still acknowledges her need to make some profit. This should encourage further negotiation without immediately closing the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

You should counteroffer at $120. This is in the middle of your last offer and Alice's current offer, showing your willingness to compromise. If Alice rejects this, you'll have to decide if you want to risk continuing the negotiation or buy from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her previous offer, it is still more than you are willing to pay. You have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. You could risk buying from John, but there's still a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

You should offer $125. It's a compromise between your last offer and Alice's last offer, and demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway. You have fewer rounds left, so you need to show Alice you're serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is not showing a willingness to compromise further. You only have one round left, and you are unlikely to get a lower price from her. It's better to buy from John for $150 to guarantee you get the product."
