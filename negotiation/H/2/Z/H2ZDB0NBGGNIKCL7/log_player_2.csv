"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $10,800, which is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to counter-offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take that option and avoid any further risk of not securing the product."
