"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
