Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, but I think it's still a great value for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to your ideal price range.  While you could try to push for a lower price, you're already within a reasonable margin of your desired price and have limited rounds left.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or running out of rounds."
