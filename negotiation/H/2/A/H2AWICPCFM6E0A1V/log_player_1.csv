{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to aim high with Bob."
