Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  your initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm also confident in the value this product represents. $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect that, and I wouldn't be doing right by myself accepting it. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value our discussions and would prefer to work something out with you.  My final offer is $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,700,000.  While she claims to have another buyer, this could be a negotiation tactic.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, which meets your needs and saves you a significant amount of money. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a sure deal elsewhere."
