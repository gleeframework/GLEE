"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  your initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $800,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend on this product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm also confident in the value this product represents. $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect that, and I wouldn't be doing right by myself accepting it. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value our discussions and would prefer to work something out with you.  My final offer is $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair offer for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
