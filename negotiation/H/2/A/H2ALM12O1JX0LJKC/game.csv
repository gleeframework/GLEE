"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
