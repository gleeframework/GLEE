"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
Alice's messaging is full of fluff about value to me, but that doesn't matter.  I have a firm alternative at $1,200,000. Her offer still leaves room for negotiation."
