"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
