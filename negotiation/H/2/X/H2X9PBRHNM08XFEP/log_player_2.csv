"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's tempting to take the $8,500, but we can likely negotiate Alice down a little further. We're still well within our budget to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? "",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $9,000?  This is a fair price that's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to come down much further. She's rejected our attempts to meet in the middle, and her latest offer is still significantly above John's price. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best price."
