"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $9,000?  This is a fair price that's still a good deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
