"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1000000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is within my budget and closer to my target price. Accepting this offer will allow me to acquire the product while still leaving some room for negotiation in the future if necessary. Buying from John at $1,200,000 might be slightly better, but this offer provides an opportunity to potentially build a relationship with Alice for future transactions."
