"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
