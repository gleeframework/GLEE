"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can get a better price from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John at $1,200,000."
