"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about we start at $12,500?  I'm open to discussing further.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a good starting point, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $14,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $13,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
