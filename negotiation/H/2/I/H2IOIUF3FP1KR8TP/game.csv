"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $900,000. This is still a significant gain for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
