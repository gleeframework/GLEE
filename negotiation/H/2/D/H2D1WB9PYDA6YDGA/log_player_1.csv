Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130.  It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate a price higher than your minimum ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $130 gives Bob a $20 discount (making it attractive) while earning you a $50 profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a fallback option with John at $80, so you don't have to go below that price.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to Bob's higher valuation while still guaranteeing a profit if he declines."
