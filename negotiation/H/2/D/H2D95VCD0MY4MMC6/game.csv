"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
