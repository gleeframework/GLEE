"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
