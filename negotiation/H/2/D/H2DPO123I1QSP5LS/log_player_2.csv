"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While the price is getting closer to his target, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he's aiming for a lower price, $1,150,000 is a good compromise.  It's still less than what he would pay John and closer to his desired price point.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
