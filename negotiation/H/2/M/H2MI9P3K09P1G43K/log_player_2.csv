"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his maximum budget and Alice's asking price.  $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a good starting point for further negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness while leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This would give us both a good deal, let's try to work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There is still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground that is closer to his budget but also shows he is willing to negotiate further.  The offer of $1,075,000 is a slight increase from his previous counteroffer, indicating his commitment while still leaving room for Alice to potentially counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,075,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $1,087,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is close to his goal of getting the product for $1,000,000 and should continue to negotiate. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,087,500 is close, but I'm still pushing for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,062,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer, suggesting a willingness to close the deal while still saving some money.  There are only a few rounds left, and this counteroffer may be enough to convince Alice to accept."
