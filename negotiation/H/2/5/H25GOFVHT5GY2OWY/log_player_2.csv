"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for much less than $900,000.  There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and your maximum willingness to pay. It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but I want to establish a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price within the range of what I'm willing to pay and what Alice might be willing to accept, given that her minimum is $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to accept $850,000 yet, as I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a good deal for myself.  This offer is closer to the midpoint between my last counteroffer and her latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm comfortable paying $825,000.  I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better price from Alice, and it's a much better deal than buying from John."
