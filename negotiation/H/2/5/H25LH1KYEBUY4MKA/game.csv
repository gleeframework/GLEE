"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  However, $6,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  It seems like we both see the value in this product. How about we try this - $12,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still think we can do better than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is my absolute maximum for this product. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,6,
