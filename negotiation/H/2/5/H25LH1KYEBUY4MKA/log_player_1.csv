"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my target.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware of John's standing offer of $12,000, which serves as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I can walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, his message indicates interest and a willingness to negotiate.  There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob stall or break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  However, $6,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility. However, the new price remains significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This strategy aims to make the offer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm still aiming to negotiate a higher price with Bob but remain aware of John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, $8,000 remains below my absolute minimum of $12,000.
* **Slow Progress:** Negotiations are progressing slowly, and we are still far apart. Bob seems to be incrementally increasing his offer, which might indicate a limit to how much he's willing to pay.
* **Time Consideration:** With each round, the risk of not reaching a deal increases. I need to start considering John's offer more seriously as time goes on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  It seems like we both see the value in this product. How about we try this - $12,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I've reached my absolute minimum acceptable price.  
* **Firm but Fair:** My message conveys a sense of firmness â€“ this is my bottom line. But I also emphasize fairness, hoping that Bob will recognize I've moved significantly from my initial offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With five rounds remaining, I'm becoming more concerned about reaching an agreement quickly. Presenting this as my final offer might encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm ready to walk away from negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer of $12,000 if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still think we can do better than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is my absolute maximum for this product. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Impasse:** It seems unlikely Bob will go higher than $9,500, which is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal and wasting valuable time I could spend finalizing the sale with John. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer of $12,000 guarantees I receive my minimum acceptable price. 

While there's a chance Bob might improve his offer, it's not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed sale at my target price."
