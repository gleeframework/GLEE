"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. My initial offer for the product is $850,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $850,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without going over his limit. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice becoming unwilling to sell makes accepting the offer the most sensible choice in this round."
