"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'd need the price to be significantly lower. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider a price closer to $800,000? I'm thinking $700,000 might work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle at $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  Honestly, $1,100,000 is pushing me towards exploring other options, and I have a reliable offer for $800,000. If you can come down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer.",850000.0,Bob,6,
