"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $11,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500?  That's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is $10,500, which is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, but it's close enough to be a good deal. There are only 7 rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price. Buying from John for $10,000 is a safer option, but accepting Alice's offer saves a bit of money and could potentially lead to a better relationship with Alice for future transactions."
