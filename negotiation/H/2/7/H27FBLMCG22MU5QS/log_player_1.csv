Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), you have room to start high. This gives you negotiating leverage. 
* **Justification:** While a simple number is fine, briefly mentioning the ""value and potential"" makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A counter-offer from Bob would provide more information about his willingness to pay. Even if he rejects the initial price, you can still negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a positive and professional tone encourages a good negotiation atmosphere. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the initial offer. However, you always have John as a backup to ensure you get your minimum price."
