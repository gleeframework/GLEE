Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you get a good return.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob incentive to accept.
* **It's a round number:**  This makes the offer look clean and professional. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take $700,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still significantly higher than what Bob offered, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  It also keeps us closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. At this point, I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, who is willing to pay $800,000. Selling to John is the most rational decision, as it guarantees me a price above my minimum acceptable value."
