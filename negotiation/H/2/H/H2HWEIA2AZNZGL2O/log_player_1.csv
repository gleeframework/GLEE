Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing his perceived value is $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
