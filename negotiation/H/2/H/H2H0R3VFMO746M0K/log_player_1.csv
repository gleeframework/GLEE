Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he might be willing to pay closer to my value, especially if he's truly interested. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum. I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd like to earn as much as possible, I'm not desperate. I will counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, offering a price of $11,000. This is still above his initial offer but a significant decrease from my initial asking price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much from his initial offer. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident in John's willingness to buy the product at my desired price, so I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from him."
