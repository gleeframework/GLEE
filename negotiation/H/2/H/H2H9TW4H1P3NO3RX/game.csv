,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we say $112.50? That's as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a little too high. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we say $112? That's as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,
