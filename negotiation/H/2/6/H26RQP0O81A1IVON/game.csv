"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a lower price point to make it work.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit beyond my budget.  To make this work, I could go up to $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close. I'm willing to make one final offer at $775,000.  It's a fair price and would allow me to close this deal today.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
