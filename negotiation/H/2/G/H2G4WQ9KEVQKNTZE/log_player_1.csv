Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's a fair price for the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8250? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,250 is above my minimum price of $8,000, and it's a good deal considering I'm close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether and having to sell to John for less."
