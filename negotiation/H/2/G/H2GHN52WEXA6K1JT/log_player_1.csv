Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see you're serious about this product.  To be honest, taking anything less than $15,000 would be really difficult for me. How about we settle at $14,000 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the $15,000.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we make it a $13,000 deal, and we can both walk away happy? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
