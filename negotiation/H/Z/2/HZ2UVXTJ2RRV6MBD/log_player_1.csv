"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum, I think I can still push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm offering $170. This is a compromise, as it's in between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $165. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price,  $165 is a good deal, and it's likely we'll just keep going back and forth if I reject.  It's important to close a deal and move on."
