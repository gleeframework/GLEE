"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate, and it's a starting point that might encourage Bob to counteroffer.  I'm also trying to frame it as a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
