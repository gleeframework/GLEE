"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so this initial offer is a bit of a gamble.  However, I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum value. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm reducing my price by $150,000.  I want to stay above my minimum value, but I'm also showing flexibility to keep Bob engaged. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I believe there's room for more negotiation, and I don't want to settle for anything too far below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's higher than my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. The negotiations with Bob haven't produced an offer that's close enough to my target price.  It's getting risky to continue with Bob, as I'm running out of rounds and might end up having to accept a lower price than I want. John's offer is a secure option that meets my minimum value, so I'm going to go with that."
