Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""significant value"" and ""potential"" to justify the higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion (""What do you think?""), allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer.  A more sophisticated negotiation strategy might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
