Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth to you. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price and have 8 rounds left to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on the product.  I'm prepared to accept $880,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}
