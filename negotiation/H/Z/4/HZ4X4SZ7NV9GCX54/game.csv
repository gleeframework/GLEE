"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on the product.  I'm prepared to accept $880,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,
