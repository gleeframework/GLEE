"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation open and can aim for a price closer to your target."
