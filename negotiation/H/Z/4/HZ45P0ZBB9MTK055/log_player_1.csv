Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  The ideal outcome is a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves Bob feeling like he got a good deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Offer Works**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting with a price that's closer to Bob's valuation than yours.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, the $50,000 difference allows space for Bob to negotiate (if he wants) and potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""significant value"" and ""unique nature,"" you're subtly reminding Bob why he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Exclusivity:**  The word ""exclusive"" adds a touch of desirability and urgency.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate if Bob counters. However, always remember your bottom line is $1,000,000."
