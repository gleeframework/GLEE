"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product to your business is significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point reflects its value while leaving room for a profitable partnership.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite a ways off. I can do $1,300,000 - I think that's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's still beneath what I consider fair.  Let's settle at $1,800,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the value of the product is recognized.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can appreciate your position on the value, but I need to stay within my budget.  How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close!  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
