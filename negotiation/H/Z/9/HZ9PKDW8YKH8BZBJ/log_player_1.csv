Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering my maximum purchase limit is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point for negotiations.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
