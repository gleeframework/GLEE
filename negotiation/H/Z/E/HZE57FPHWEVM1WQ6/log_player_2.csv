Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $5,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to go down to $7,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $7,500 is a significant discount from her initial offer and a decent saving compared to John's price.
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice pulling out or you running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at $8,000."
