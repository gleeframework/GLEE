"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable to me, $12,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to offer $5,000 to start the negotiations.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $5,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $6,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to go down to $7,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,5,
