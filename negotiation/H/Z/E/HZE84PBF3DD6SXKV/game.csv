"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product.  It's truly one of a kind. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price you're asking is way above what I'm willing to pay. This product is valuable, but not to the tune of $2,250,000. I'm prepared to offer you $800,000.  It's a fair offer that reflects my genuine interest while acknowledging the need for a realistic price point. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider. This product offers exceptional value that I'm confident you'll reap the benefits from. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,350,000?  I believe this reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while being a realistic investment on my end.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I can't let it go for less than $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I appreciate you working with me.  However, I have a firm budget, and $1,600,000 falls outside of that range. My best offer is $1,200,000.  If you're unable to accept this, I will, unfortunately, need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
