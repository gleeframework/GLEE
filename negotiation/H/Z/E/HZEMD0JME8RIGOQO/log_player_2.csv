"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to understand Alice's flexibility and establish a lower baseline.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing continued interest in the product while clearly stating the price is an issue. This approach keeps the negotiation open and encourages a counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise considering the value you've stated. Let me know if you're open to it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above her valuation of the product. We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That's a fair price that considers both of our positions."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation. Providing a reason for the suggested price can make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Maintaining Positive Momentum:** By acknowledging Alice's effort to negotiate and proposing a specific price point, the message encourages a continued dialogue and hopefully a final agreement."
