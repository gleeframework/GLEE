"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can do $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'd be happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $8,200, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",8200.0,Alice,7,
