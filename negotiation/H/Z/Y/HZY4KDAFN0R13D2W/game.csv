"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
