"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's original offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate without losing too much, while also getting Bob a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob considering he can buy it from John for $12,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
