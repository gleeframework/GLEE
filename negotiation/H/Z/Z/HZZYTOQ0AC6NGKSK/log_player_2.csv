"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if you can get her price down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a profitable price for Alice. This strategy aims to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price considering your value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We're closer to her value now, so we need to proceed more cautiously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to do $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counter-offer inches closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It shows willingness to compromise without conceding too much at once."
