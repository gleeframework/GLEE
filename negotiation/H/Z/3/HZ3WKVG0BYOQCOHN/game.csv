"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it,  considering it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
