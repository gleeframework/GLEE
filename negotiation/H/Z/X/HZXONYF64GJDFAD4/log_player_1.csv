Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that my minimum is $80. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid with the price, leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a middle ground that's closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive & Fair:** I'm using a positive and fair tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (splitting the difference) to make it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that. However, $77.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining Ground:** I'm not immediately dropping to Bob's offer, but showing flexibility by coming down a bit. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Bridge the Gap:** I'm using language that suggests a desire to reach a compromise and move closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $79.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed $80, which meets my minimum and saves me the time and potential stress of further haggling."
