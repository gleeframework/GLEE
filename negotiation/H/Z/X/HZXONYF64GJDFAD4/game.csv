"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to consider that?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That way, we both get a good deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? Would you be willing to consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that. However, $77.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, wouldn't you agree?",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",79.5,Bob,6,
