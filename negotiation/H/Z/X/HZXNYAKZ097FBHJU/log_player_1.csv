Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum value.
* **Staying above my minimum:** The offer is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000, giving me the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a suitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. This is the highest price I am comfortable paying given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** While Bob's offer is lower, he is clearly willing to pay a significant amount for the product. I can potentially negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price would still allow me a decent profit and hopefully is within your budget. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to concede too much.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000 and above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a reasonable profit. 
* **Focus on the value:**  I emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. This can help Bob see the benefits of accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has firmly stated his budget constraints and is unwilling to budge on his $1,300,000 offer. 
* **Risk of going lower:** Further counteroffers could lead to a lower price, potentially falling below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable price.

By selling to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of potentially accepting a lower price in further negotiations with Bob."
