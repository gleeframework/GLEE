**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $110?  I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $120. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price before deciding on John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a little more than I want to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $117.50?  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 117.50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $121.25? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $121.25 is still slightly higher than John's offer of $120. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John at this point. It's a small difference, but every dollar counts!"
