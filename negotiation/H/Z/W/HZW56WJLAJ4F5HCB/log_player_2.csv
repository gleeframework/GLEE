"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still quite close to the $1,000,000 backup option. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. We can use the counteroffer process to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing a strong desire to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer is a good starting point to gauge how much Alice is willing to compromise. 
* **Not Too Low:**  $700,000 still leaves room for negotiation while not risking losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer.
* **Reasonable Price:** $800,000 is a good price, considering my maximum budget and the value I'm hoping to get from the product.
* **Saves Money:**  This offer saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John.

While I could potentially try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal or having the negotiation drag on for longer is not worth it. Accepting this offer secures a good product at a fair price."
