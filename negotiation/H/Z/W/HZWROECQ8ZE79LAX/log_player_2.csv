"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.  

By rejecting, Bob can test the waters and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still leave a good profit margin for you, and it's a much better price for me.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,400,000 to $1,300,000.  This is a good price for Bob, as it's lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject a lower counteroffer and then decide to sell to John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,300,000 is the most prudent choice."
