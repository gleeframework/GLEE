"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12000 to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
