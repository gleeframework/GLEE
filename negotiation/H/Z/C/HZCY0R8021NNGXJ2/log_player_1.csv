Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at $140 gives Bob a potential bargain and me a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer. This leaves space for a potential agreement where we both benefit.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum."
