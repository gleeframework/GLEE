"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working towards a compromise. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within a reasonable range for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $950,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $875,000, which is a fair price considering both its value and my budget. Let me know if that works for you.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $925,000 is my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth while still working within your budget.",925000.0,Alice,7,
