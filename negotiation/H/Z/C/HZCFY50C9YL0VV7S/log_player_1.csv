"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,200,000). This signals that the product is valuable while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind, you have the fallback option of selling to John for your minimum price. This strengthens your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product.  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  You're making a substantial concession to demonstrate your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  While a large drop, it keeps the price well above Bob's offer and closer to your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  You have time for further negotiation, so there's no need to rush to meet Bob's low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working towards a compromise. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within a reasonable range for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his perceived value, but you're still significantly above that.  While $850,000 is a tempting offer, you have room to negotiate further and should aim to close the gap. You are better off countering again, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $950,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's current offer ($850,000) and your previous price ($1,000,000). It signals fairness and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Strategic Position:** This price point allows for potential further negotiation but still keeps you well within a profitable margin. You're above your minimum and moving closer to the true value of the product.
* **Time Awareness:** You're halfway through the rounds, so it's time to start narrowing the gap and pushing for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $875,000, which is a fair price considering both its value and my budget. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the later rounds, and while Bob is inching up, the increments are getting smaller. This indicates he's likely reaching his maximum. While $875,000 is a decent profit, accepting now leaves potential money on the table.  It's worth leveraging your guaranteed offer from John to push for a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $925,000 is my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth while still working within your budget."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about closing the deal but not willing to concede further.  
* **Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** You're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous price point, showing a willingness to compromise but also holding your ground.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, you want to push Bob towards a decision while still leaving some room for a possible counter from him."
