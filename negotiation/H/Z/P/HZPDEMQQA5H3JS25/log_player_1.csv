{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging a positive negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a firm price, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. I'll watch Bob's response and be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll assess his offer and either accept or counter with a higher price. 
* **Walk Away:** If Bob's offers become too low, or if the negotiation drags on, I'll confidently walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he acknowledges the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium. This indicates potential for a successful negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I'll aim for a price that is both attractive to Bob and profitable for me. By rejecting his initial offer, I show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to discussing a price closer to $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that even at $1,050,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us. I believe $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value he'll receive. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider adjusting my price slightly in the next round, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Compromise and deal closure:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and is clearly eager to close the deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Limited potential for improvement:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Bob will walk away if I reject his offer again. This could lead to a longer negotiation process and potentially losing the sale altogether.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all. This is a good compromise that balances my desire for a high price with the need to close the deal."
