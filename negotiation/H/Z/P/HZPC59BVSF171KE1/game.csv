"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's find a way to make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,5,
