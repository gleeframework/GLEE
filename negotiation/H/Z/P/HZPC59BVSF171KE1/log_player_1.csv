"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully get Bob interested. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows me to potentially come down in future rounds if necessary. 
* **Always having a backup:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John is always an option:** I know I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Splitting the difference:**  A compromise approach often leads to more successful negotiations. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and constructive,  making Bob feel heard. 
* **Continuing to negotiate:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation, but still puts me in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John is still an option:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting him halfway on my previous offer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing a fair deal:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting finding a way to make the deal happen, implying that further negotiations might be difficult."
