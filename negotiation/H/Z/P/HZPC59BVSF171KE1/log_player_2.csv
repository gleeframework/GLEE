Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's find a way to make this happen.

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice is not willing to budge on her offer, and Bob has reached his limit on how much he's willing to pay. Buying from John will save him $1,000 and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
