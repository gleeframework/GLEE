Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without appearing overly aggressive. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
