"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I know will be of immense value to you. I'm confident it will deliver exactly what you need.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant reduction in the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer and still a good deal for you, given the value it holds.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've emphasized, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, and offer the product for $1,012,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value and potential of this product for you. Let's make this happen.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer $975,000 again, but I need you to meet me at that price. I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value you've emphasized and my budget constraints.",975000.0,Bob,6,
