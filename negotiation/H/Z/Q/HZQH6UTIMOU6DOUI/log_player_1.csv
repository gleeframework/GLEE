{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I know will be of immense value to you. I'm confident it will deliver exactly what you need.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant reduction in the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer and still a good deal for you, given the value it holds.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've emphasized, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $975,000 is still below my minimum. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, and offer the product for $1,012,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value and potential of this product for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer $975,000 again, but I need you to meet me at that price. I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value you've emphasized and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

Bob seems unwilling to budge. It's getting close to my minimum, but with only a few rounds left, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement. I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
