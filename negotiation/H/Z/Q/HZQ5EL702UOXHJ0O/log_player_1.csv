Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiations by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open for a potential win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand your product has a higher value to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $85 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. While Bob is only willing to pay $85 now,  I can try to secure a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my desired price of $120. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product.  That's still a great deal considering its value, and I believe it's fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $85 and my previous offer of $100. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the rationale behind my counteroffer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to reconsider his stance and find common ground.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the negotiation open and explore possibilities for reaching an agreement. 

This approach aims to maintain a positive and collaborative negotiation while ensuring I'm not giving away too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $90 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than his previous offer of $85.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will reject my offer and walk away.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob comes with the opportunity cost of potentially losing John as a buyer. If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I might end up selling to John for $120, but I'll have missed the opportunity to sell to Bob for $90.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is the most strategic decision in this situation. It secures a sale that's relatively close to my minimum price while minimizing the risk of losing out on a potential buyer."
