Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing you closer to his maximum perceived value. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer to avoid scaring him off.
* **Time constraints:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer might be better.  

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
