Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) sets a strong anchor.  This might make Bob view a counter-offer as more reasonable.
* **Creating Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. You can always come down in price during the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be better. 
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so consider how much risk you're willing to take for a potentially higher profit."
