"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500000 to $700000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is unfortunately far below the product's true value. Given its unique capabilities and the potential benefits it holds for your business, I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be a fair reflection of its worth. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000. This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment while giving you a substantial opportunity to acquire this valuable asset.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am comfortable with a price closer to $700000.

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to move towards a more agreeable price.  While $700000 is closer to my desired range, it still falls short of the product's true value.  I'm confident this product can provide significant benefits to your business, and I'm prepared to offer a final compromise.  To expedite our agreement, I'm willing to accept $900000 for the product. This price reflects the value we both recognize while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Alice,5,
