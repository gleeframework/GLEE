"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for a lower price than $9,000. Keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and the current offer is within your budget. It's a good deal, considering you can still get the product for less than $10,000. It's better to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
