"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target value.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
