Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a better deal than that, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I can see that you're willing to pay more than $8,000, so I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer on this price point, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's still quite far from a price you're comfortable with.  She's unlikely to come down to $10,000, especially after stating $11,000 is her final offer at this price point. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
