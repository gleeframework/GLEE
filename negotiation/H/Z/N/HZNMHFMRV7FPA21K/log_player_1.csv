Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good compromise. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 I could get from John. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and highlights the potential value to Bob.  It encourages a positive response without being pushy. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, ensuring I don't lose out on significant value."
