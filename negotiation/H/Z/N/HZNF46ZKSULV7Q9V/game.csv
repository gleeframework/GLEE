"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
