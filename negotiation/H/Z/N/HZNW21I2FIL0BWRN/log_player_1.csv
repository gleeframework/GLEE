Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on your negotiation skills and Bob's willingness to pay a premium.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the stated values, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor with Justification:** Start with a high price, even above John's offer.  Provide strong reasons why your product is worth that much, potentially highlighting benefits Bob might not have considered.  This aims to shift his perception of value.

2. **Direct Deal with John:**  Knowing Bob likely won't meet your minimum, bypass the negotiation and sell directly to John for the guaranteed price.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Example)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique features and potential to significantly impact your business growth (mention specific benefits tailored to Bob), I'm confident it's worth significantly more than your initial valuation. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This is an investment that will pay dividends for years to come."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Information is Key:** The more you know about Bob's needs and motivations, the better you can tailor your offer and message.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, even if he doesn't buy this time, factor that into your approach. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you're under time pressure, dealing with John directly might be more efficient. 

**Ultimately, the best offer depends on your risk tolerance, your relationship with Bob, and how much you believe you can shift his perception of the product's value.**"
