Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,080,000, which is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and a significant saving compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best strategy for Bob, as further negotiation might not result in a lower price and could risk losing the deal altogether."
