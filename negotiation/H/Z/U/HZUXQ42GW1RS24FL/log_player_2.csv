"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  While my minimum selling price is confidential, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,150,000. I think this represents a fair deal given its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with your backup option of buying from John."
