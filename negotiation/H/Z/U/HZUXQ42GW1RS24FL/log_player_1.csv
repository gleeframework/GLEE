Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  While my minimum selling price is confidential, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,150,000. I think this represents a fair deal given its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her own valuation as possible. 
* **Don't Price Out Bob:** Offering it at $1,200,000 (her own value) guarantees Bob will reject it. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price above $1,150,000 but still below $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
