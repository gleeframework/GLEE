"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly above your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $600,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still represents a significant value for both of us. If Alice rejects this, I'll adjust my offer based on her response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for my desired price.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $600,000. I'm not yet ready to give up on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $650,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still want a price that's more favorable to me.  It's a compromise that could be appealing to Alice, especially as she's already rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not in my ideal range. I'm going to continue to negotiate. With 5 rounds left, I have time to see if I can get a better price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $650,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $700,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking her counteroffers into account.  We're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, and I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeatedly rejected my counteroffers, suggesting she's not willing to go lower than $725,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating. Accepting her offer now allows me to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer. I'm happy with this outcome, as it allows me to save a substantial amount of money while still acquiring the desired product."
