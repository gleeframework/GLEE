"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,175,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need you to come down to at least $1,150,000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
