"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and offers a significant return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price of $800,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range."
