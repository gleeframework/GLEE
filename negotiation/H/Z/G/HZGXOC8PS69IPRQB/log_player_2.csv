"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further since you can get the product for $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's below Alice's offer but still above John's price, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price, and it's not clear if further negotiation will get her closer to my desired price. It's better to secure the product from John at my preferred price."
