"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable for me, but I think the price needs to come down quite a bit.  How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $675,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal.  I'm willing to move my price up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up to $700,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  My final offer is $712,500. If you can't agree to that, I'll have to consider my other options.",712500.0,Bob,8,
