"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $18,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. If you're open to discussing this further, I'm happy to hear your thoughts. ",15000.0,Bob,2,
