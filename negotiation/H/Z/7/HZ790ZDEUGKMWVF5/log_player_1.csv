Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $18,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. If you're open to discussing this further, I'm happy to hear your thoughts.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
