"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $950,000. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum budget, but I want to try and negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where it's likely to be profitable for her.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation,  hoping to find a middle ground in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I have 7 rounds left and there's potential to negotiate further. I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm offering a price that is closer to her last offer but still within my budget. The message emphasizes a sense of urgency and a desire to reach a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your offer while ensuring I can meet my minimum requirement. I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $890,000, which is within my budget and only $20,000 away from my last counteroffer. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly better price in the remaining rounds, and there's a risk of her increasing the price again. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, ensuring I get the product at a price that's within my budget and profitable for both parties."
