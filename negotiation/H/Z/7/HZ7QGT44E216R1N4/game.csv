"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's close this now.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.
