"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price by claiming you value the product at $15,000.  While her offer is less than John's, there's room for negotiation.
