$25,000 is way over your budget. It's better to try negotiating with Alice first."

Let's start with a significant discount. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."

Alice is still asking for too much.  I'm going to try to negotiate further, but if we don't get closer to my budget soon, I might buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

We're getting closer, but $18,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'll make one more counteroffer, and then I might have to go with John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
