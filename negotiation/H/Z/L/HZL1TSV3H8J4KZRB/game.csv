"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $900,000 is too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and still leaves plenty of room for you to profit from this valuable product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your target price, Alice. However, I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",970000.0,Bob,6,
