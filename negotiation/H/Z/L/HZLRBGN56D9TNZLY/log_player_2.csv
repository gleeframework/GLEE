* **Alice's Offer:** $140.
* **Analysis:**  While this is a reasonable offer, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Value:** $150

Bob is offering $130, which is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is still within Bob's value range and allows for potential room for negotiation. By offering a more aggressive price, Bob increases his chances of securing a better deal without losing too much value."
