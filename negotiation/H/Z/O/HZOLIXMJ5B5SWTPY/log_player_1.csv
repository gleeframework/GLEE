Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers our baseline of $1,500,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product significantly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might raise suspicion or undervalue it.  A price of $1,400,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still being enticing to Bob.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** Highlighting the limited-time nature and the existence of other ""interested parties"" (even if John is our only other option) can encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have some time to negotiate with Bob before we need to finalize the sale with John.
*  Gathering more information about Bob's specific needs and motivations could lead to even more effective negotiation tactics."
