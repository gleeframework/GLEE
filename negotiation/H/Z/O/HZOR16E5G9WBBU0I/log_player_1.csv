Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it leaves room for potential negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $120, so there's no downside to trying for a higher price."
