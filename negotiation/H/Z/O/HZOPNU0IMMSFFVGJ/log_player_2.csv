"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can get the product for $80 from John, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to your goal, you can still do better. Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John for $80 if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to offer the product for $92. This is my final offer before I go with my other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is getting closer to your price, but $92 is still more than what you are willing to pay. It's best to buy from John for $80, saving you $12.  You've already spent several rounds trying to get a better deal, and the risk of not being able to agree with Alice is too high."
