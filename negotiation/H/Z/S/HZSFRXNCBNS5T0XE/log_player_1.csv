"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting position. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob feel comfortable and encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I've highlighted that the product is something Bob would appreciate, further enticing him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $120, so there's a margin for compromise.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to hold firm on my price, potentially pushing Bob to come up a bit. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  The negotiation process is just beginning, and I want to see if I can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $85. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm responding to Bob's counteroffer with a compromise, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Mid-Point:**  $92.50 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85, suggesting a fair solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is ""fair"" to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $87.5 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.5 is very close to my minimum price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Potential for More:**  Although it's not my ideal price, I can still make a profit.  
* **Time is Money:**  I don't want to waste more time negotiating when I can secure a decent profit."
