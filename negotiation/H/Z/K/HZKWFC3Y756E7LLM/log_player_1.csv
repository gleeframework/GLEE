"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see what Bob's initial response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $130 is significantly better than selling to John for $100. We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
