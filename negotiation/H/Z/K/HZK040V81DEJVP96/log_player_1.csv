Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting with an offer above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Anchor high:** A high initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a slightly lower price later. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The message suggests you're open to discussing the price (""What are your thoughts?""), which could lead to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Important Note:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, pushing for the highest possible price with Bob might make him walk away. Gauge his reactions to your initial offer and be prepared to negotiate slightly if necessary."
