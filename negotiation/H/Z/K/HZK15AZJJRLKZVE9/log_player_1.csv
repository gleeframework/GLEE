Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" and ""significant returns,""  Alice provides a reason for the high price without explicitly stating its worth to her.
* **Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 ensures Alice won't go below that price. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
