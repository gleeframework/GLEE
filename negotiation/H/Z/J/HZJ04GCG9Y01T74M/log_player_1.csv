"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with an open-ended question to invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering it leaves a lot of room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to accept due to the pressure of the limited rounds, it's crucial to remember my minimum value for the product is $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss. 

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer. This will allow me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I reiterate my position that $600,000 is unacceptable, but I also express willingness to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:**  I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the potential for a ""fair profit for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I need to hold firm to my bottom line and continue negotiating. Rejecting his offer will allow me to counteroffer and hopefully find a more acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're still far apart, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge the distance between our offers but reiterate my unwillingness to accept his price. 
* **Middle Ground:**  I propose a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and his offer ($750,000).
* **Positive Framing:** I continue to emphasize mutual benefit and a ""reasonable profit."" This creates a more collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest price I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While this is a tempting offer given the limited rounds, it would be a significant financial loss for me. It's important to stick to my bottom line and continue negotiating. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This will give me another chance to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm stance:**  I reiterate that Bob's offer is too low and reaffirm the value of the product.
* **Final Offer:** I emphasize that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially prompting Bob to reconsider.
