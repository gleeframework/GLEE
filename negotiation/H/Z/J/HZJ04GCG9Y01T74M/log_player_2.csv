Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me. This product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment. To make progress, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will close the gap, and you risk missing out on the product entirely if you continue. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best possible price for you."
