"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering it leaves a lot of room for negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're still far apart, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest price I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me. This product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment. To make progress, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
