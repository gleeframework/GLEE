Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
