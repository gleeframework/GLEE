"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a lot of room to negotiate down towards your $150 maximum and closer to Alice's $80 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer leaves significant room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it sets a lower anchor point for the bargaining process.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $100, we're aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's value ($80) and our maximum ($150)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  We're aiming to get the price below $100, and her willingness to come down to $110 suggests that's possible. We're still well below our fallback option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $105 presents it as a compromise, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of the last two offers ($100 and $110), it appears like a fair deal.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The tone remains positive, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
