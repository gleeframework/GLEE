Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make this work. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a discount, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get close to the value you have in mind. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
