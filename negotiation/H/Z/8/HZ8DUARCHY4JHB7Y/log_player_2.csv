"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make this work. Would you consider $600,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a discount, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get close to the value you have in mind. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown she is not willing to go below $1,100,000.  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, our maximum price. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice."
