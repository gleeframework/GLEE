"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I believe this product is worth more than that, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $12,500? I'm confident we can both be happy with that figure.",12500.0,Bob,4,
