"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and starting negotiations is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness about negotiating.
* **Fair Offer:**  $12,000 is still a reasonable price for Bob, given his maximum budget and the value the product holds for him.
* **Open Communication:** The message expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while clearly stating Bob's position. It also encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I believe this product is worth more than that, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worth continuing the negotiation process to see if he can get closer to his target.
* **Room for Improvement:** Bob has 7 rounds left, which is enough time to explore a better price. He can likely push Alice down further.
* **Risk Management:**  While purchasing from John is a safe option, it's still more expensive than the potential deal with Alice. Bob should continue to pursue the lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $12,500? I'm confident we can both be happy with that figure."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer offers a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and Bob's previous offer.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $12,500 is a fair price point for both parties. It's a good price for Bob, and it's still a significant profit for Alice compared to her $10,000 value.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
