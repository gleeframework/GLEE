,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $90 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $87?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
