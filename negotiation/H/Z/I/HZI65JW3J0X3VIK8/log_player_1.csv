Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and while Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I think we can still negotiate a more favorable price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still within a reasonable range for me, given the value to Bob. It's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
