Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but $110 is still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $107.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  This is a great price for you, and it's still a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $109.  How about $108?  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $108 is only slightly below my minimum, but it's a fair price considering the time we've spent negotiating. I'm also mindful that we're nearing the end of our rounds."
