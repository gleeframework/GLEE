"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but $110 is still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  This is a great price for you, and it's still a fair deal for me.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $109.  How about $108?  Let's close this deal!",108.0,Bob,6,
