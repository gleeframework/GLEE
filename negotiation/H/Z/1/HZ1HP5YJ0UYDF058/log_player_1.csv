I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's also a significant concession from my original offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price that is too low for me.  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as it could take us down a path where I might be forced to accept a lower price than John's offer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
