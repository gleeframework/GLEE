"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
