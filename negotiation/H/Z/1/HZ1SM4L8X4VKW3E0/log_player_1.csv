Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a good profit. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also signals I'm not willing to go too low just yet."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
