"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying that it's worth even more than the asking price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal within the first few rounds, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. I'll keep the John option in mind as a fallback if negotiations stall or become too time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  There's room for further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. If we can't reach an agreement quickly, I'll keep the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not compromising on my minimum.
* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This makes it seem like a compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John. I'm keeping an eye on the time limit and the potential risk of a deal falling through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room for further negotiation, and I have several rounds left to try and close a better deal.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob seems willing to negotiate, suggesting he might be willing to pay more than $9,500. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. However, I'll keep the option of selling to John open if negotiations fail or become too time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, even if it's slightly higher than his offer.
* **Focus on Profit:** I'm subtly mentioning profit to make it clear that I need a certain amount to make the deal worthwhile for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal with Bob. If he rejects it again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time and rounds. I'll keep a close eye on the situation and be prepared to act decisively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget and make the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Running out of time:** We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes more appealing.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, we might reach a stalemate, and I'll be forced to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to reach an agreement quickly. If Bob rejects it again, I'll seriously consider selling to John. I need to be decisive and avoid getting stuck in a long negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm coming down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a good profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** I'm offering a price very close to my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise and close the deal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, but I'm also emphasizing the profit I need to make.
* **Confidence in agreement:** I'm expressing confidence in reaching an agreement, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This is a risky move, as I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'll likely sell to John.  I'm running out of time and need to secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Running out of time:** We have only two rounds left, and there's a risk that Bob might not budge further. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. 

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me a good price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation. It's the most logical and financially secure option at this point."
