"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. My next counteroffer is $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
