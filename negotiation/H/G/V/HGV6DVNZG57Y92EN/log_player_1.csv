Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, so you start above your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** It leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could scare Bob away. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** You still have some wiggle room if Bob wants to go lower.
* **Is closer to your desired price:**  You're trying to get as close as possible to your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price for you.  Bob has shown that he's willing to walk away, and $105 is a good compromise.  You're still making a profit, and it's close enough to your desired price to make it worthwhile."
