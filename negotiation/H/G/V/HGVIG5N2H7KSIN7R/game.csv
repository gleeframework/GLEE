"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way below what I'm looking for. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $75? That's a reasonable jump from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
