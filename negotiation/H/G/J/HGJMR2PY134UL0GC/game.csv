"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and availability.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  This product offers immense value, and I believe $1,275,000 represents a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth. This offer stands until the end of the day tomorrow.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while it's closer to my budget, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000 for the product. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
