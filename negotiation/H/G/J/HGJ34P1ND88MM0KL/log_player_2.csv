"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially since you're showing interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant jump down from Alice's price.  It shows you're serious about buying, but also sets a clear expectation that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. $12000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This takes into account the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in a back-and-forth scenario.  The counteroffer is a small increment closer to Alice's price, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It also reinforces the idea that you are serious about buying but will walk away if the price doesn't become more appealing."
