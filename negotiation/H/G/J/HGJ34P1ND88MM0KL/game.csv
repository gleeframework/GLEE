"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. $12000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This takes into account the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
