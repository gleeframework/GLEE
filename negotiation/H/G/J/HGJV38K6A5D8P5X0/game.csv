"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $1,200,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to get what we need.  I'm open to making this deal happen, but I need to be at a price that reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
