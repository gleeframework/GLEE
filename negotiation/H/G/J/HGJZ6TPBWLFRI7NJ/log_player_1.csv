{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which could encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $11,000. Let's meet halfway, and I'm sure we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I really appreciate your continued interest in my product. $10,500 is closer, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
