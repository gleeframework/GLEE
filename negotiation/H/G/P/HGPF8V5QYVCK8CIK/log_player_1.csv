"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a positive message to create a good impression and build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a starting point and inviting Bob to respond. This indicates I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet. John's offer is my fallback option, but I'd prefer to see if I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum. I'll aim to reach a price that both of us are happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great deal for such a fantastic product! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $90, which is a compromise, but still higher than my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value and framing the price as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiations, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
