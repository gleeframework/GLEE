Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. This is my last offer before considering other options.

This is a fair deal. Alice is at her bottom line (we know it's worth $800,000 to her), and you're saving $200,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome for you."
