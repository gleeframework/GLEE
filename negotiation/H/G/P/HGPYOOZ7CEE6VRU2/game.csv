"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we both have other options. I can go up to $775,000, but that's really the absolute limit for me.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.
