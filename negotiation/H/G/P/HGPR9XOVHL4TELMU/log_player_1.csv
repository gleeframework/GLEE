"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it's not outrageously so, acknowledging that Bob also sees significant value in the product.  The $100,000 difference allows space for bargaining.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price.  While we could accept and end the negotiation now, there's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal. We're only in Round 2, and we have room to counter before potentially accepting his valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving to $1,300,000, we signal to Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's offer still keeps us significantly above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Clear Justification:** The message emphasizes fairness and positions the compromise as a win-win solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, we still have leverage. We're early in the negotiation (Round 4 of 10), and there's room for him to increase his offer. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table. We'll counter, but carefully consider our next move to encourage him upward without stalling the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can see we're getting closer.  How about we land at $1,280,000? This is a significant move on my part to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1280000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our concession size ($20,000 instead of $50,000) to signal we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Highlighting Movement:**  By emphasizing our willingness to move, we're subtly putting the onus on Bob to reciprocate with a meaningful step up.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still a healthy $80,000 above our absolute minimum, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,280,000, which would be $1,265,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's offer of $1,265,000 is a good deal. It's a significant amount above our minimum ($65,000 more than John's offer) and shows he's serious while staying within reasonable negotiating boundaries.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, signaling he's unlikely to move much higher.  
* **Time Consideration:** We still have time, but continuing to push hard could risk Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a profitable outcome."
