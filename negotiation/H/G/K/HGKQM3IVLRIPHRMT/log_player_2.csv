{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While $9,500 is still more than the product's worth to you, it's a better deal than paying $10,000 to John.
* **Saving money is the goal:** The goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer achieves this."
