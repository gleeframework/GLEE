"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a fair price and opening the door for discussion. 
* **Strategy:**  I want to see if Bob will bite at this initial offer, and gauge his reaction to determine the best negotiating strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from your original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I'm confident I can do better.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'm not rushing it.** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer.** By rejecting, I retain control of the negotiation and can explore a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm  countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Message:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a ""final offer"" to increase the pressure on Bob and make him more likely to accept.
* **Strategy:**  By using a firm stance, I'm hoping to either secure a deal at $1,600,000 or encourage Bob to increase his offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I'm still confident I can do better.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'm not rushing it.** I still have 6 rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer.** By rejecting, I retain control of the negotiation and can explore a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm going to make a counteroffer to Bob, but this time I'll make it clear that I'm getting close to my limit and might consider selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm prepared to consider selling to another buyer if we can't find common ground. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Message:** I'm using stronger language to emphasize that this is a ""final compromise"" and I'm seriously considering selling to John if we can't agree. This adds urgency and pressure to Bob.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping to signal that I'm close to my limit, making Bob more likely to increase his offer or accept my compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **The negotiations are getting nowhere.**  We've gone back and forth, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of Bob rejecting my offers.

With only 4 rounds left, it's wiser to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than continue with Bob and risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
