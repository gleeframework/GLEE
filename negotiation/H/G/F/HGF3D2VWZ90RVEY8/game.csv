"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from your original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm prepared to consider selling to another buyer if we can't find common ground. Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
