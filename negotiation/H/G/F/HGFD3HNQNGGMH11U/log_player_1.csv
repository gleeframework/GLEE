I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be enough to get us closer to a deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my last offer, and it's significantly higher than John's offer.  Accepting this deal will secure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
