Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies that the product is valuable enough to warrant the asking price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that you'll list the product publicly if Bob declines, you subtly introduce the idea that he might miss out if he doesn't take the current offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiations are highly contextual.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and the perceived uniqueness of the product could all influence your approach."
