Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1,275,000.

It's time to buy from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to drop much further:** Alice knows your walk-away price is likely close to John's offer. She's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but each concession is getting smaller.
* **Time is a factor:**  You're halfway through the rounds.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks her not coming down enough, leaving you with a worse outcome in the end.
* **John's price is a sure thing:** You're guaranteed to get the product for $1,200,000, which is within your budget.

While you might be able to squeeze a slightly better price from Alice, it's not worth the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from John at a price you know works."
