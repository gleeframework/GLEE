"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,350,000. This reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm currently able to spend.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the value it holds for me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1,275,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a reasonable margin for me. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
