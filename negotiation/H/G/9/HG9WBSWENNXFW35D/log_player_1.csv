"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me.  I have 8 more rounds to try and reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12250. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,250 is above my minimum price of $12,000 and closer to what I'd like to get.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without risking a lower offer from Bob or having to go through more rounds of negotiation. It's also better than selling to John for $12,000."
