"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a unique and exceptional item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal limit of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to stay under $1,200,000. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, it's still too high.  He should continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and is a significant step closer to my initial price point. Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1325000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target of $1,200,000. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a worse offer outweighs the potential reward of saving a small amount of money.  Buying from John guarantees the best price within Bob's budget."
