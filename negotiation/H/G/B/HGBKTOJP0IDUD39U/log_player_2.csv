"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Is there any flexibility in that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  While $13,000 represents a fair price given the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and while $11,500 is still more than Bob's ideal price of $10,000, it's a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  At this point, there's not much room for further negotiation, so accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
