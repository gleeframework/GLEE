Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so don't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation gives him a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** 
    * It emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a touch of urgency and desirability.
    * It highlights the ""potential value"" without explicitly stating the $1,200,000 Bob perceives, allowing him to draw his own conclusions.
    * It positions the offer as ""fair"" to encourage a positive response.
    * It ends with an open-ended question to invite Bob's input and gauge his interest.
* **Price:**  The $1,100,000 price point gives you a $300,000 profit (significantly more than your $800,000 fallback) while still saving Bob $100,000 compared to his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is an art. Bob's response to this offer might prompt you to adjust your price slightly. Be prepared to be flexible while keeping your bottom line in mind."
