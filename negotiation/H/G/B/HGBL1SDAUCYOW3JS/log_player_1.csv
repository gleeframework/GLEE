Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know the product's absolute minimum worth to you ($1,200,000) and John provides a safety net at that price. This allows you to confidently negotiate.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy and provide insight into his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests some willingness to negotiate, accepting $900,000 would be a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. To move this forward, I could consider $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:**  While you want to move towards a deal, Bob's offer was very low.  This counteroffer signals that you're serious about negotiating but won't accept a lowball offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's capabilities, you're subtly reminding Bob of its value.
* **Compromise:**  The tone aims to show you are willing to meet him partway, but only if he's willing to move significantly closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Stronger Negotiating Position:**  You've already established you have another buyer (John), giving you a strong fallback position.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing negotiations could lead to a better price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting the current offer secures a good profit."
