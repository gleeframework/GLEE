Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 or more to Bob is unlikely to work, as he values it less. A price slightly below his valuation ($1,000,000) increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John.

This approach balances risk and reward, maximizing the potential for Alice to secure the best possible deal."
