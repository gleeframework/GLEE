"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to go up to $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $98 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
