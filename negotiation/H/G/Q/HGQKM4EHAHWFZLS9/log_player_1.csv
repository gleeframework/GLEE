Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to try and get a better price than $95. It's still too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to go up to $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $98 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
