"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget and the fact that I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8,000, I believe it would be more beneficial for both of us if I were to buy the product from John instead.",8000.0,Bob,4,
