Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,250 is still out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  I'm eager to finalize this purchase, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and time is a factor. Taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John is the best move at this point."
