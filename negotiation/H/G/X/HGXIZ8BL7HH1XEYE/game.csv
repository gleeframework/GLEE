"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $16,000 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway at $12,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,250 is still out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  I'm eager to finalize this purchase, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  However, I need to get closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,6,
