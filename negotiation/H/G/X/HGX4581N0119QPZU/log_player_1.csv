Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This leaves no room for negotiation but immediately shows Bob that I'm serious about getting my desired value. If he rejects this, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible but still prioritize getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm willing to risk continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm raising my offer again to $940,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I hope this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better outcome. I'm not willing to go any lower than $940,000, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher than $920,000.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While it would be nice to get more, this ensures I get my minimum desired value."
