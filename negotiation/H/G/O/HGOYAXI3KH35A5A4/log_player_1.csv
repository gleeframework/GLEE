"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd need to go even lower. How about $9,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to take $9,750, it's still lower than what I consider a fair price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's a safe and quick way to close the deal."
