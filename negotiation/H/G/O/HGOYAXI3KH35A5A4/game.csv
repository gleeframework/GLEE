"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd need to go even lower. How about $9,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,
