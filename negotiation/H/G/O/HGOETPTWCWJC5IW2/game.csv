"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800 was my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,200. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go as low as $10,200.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350?  That's a fair price that's closer to both of our numbers.",10350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,350. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price I was originally offered by John. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
