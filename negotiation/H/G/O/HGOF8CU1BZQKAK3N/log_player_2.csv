"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70

``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to your desired range while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you can still try to haggle a little further since her offer is still above John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

We're getting closer to your limit, but it's still worth trying to meet in the middle between your previous offer and Alice's current one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original price. How about we try $84? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice seems to be stuck at a price point that's not beneficial for you.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John, who's offering the product at your target price."
