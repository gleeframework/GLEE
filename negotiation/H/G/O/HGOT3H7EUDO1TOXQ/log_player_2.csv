"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this exceptional item at a special introductory price of $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a good start, but there's still room for negotiation. It's unlikely she'll offer her lowest acceptable price right away.  I'll counter-offer in the next round and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $750,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. For the next round, I propose a price of $700,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $675,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 675000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise. I propose a price of $690,000 for the product. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one! Alice is drawing a line in the sand, and while I'd like to get it lower, $690,000 is a decent price.  I don't want to risk her walking away from the table and having to settle for John's $800,000 price.  I'll accept her offer."
