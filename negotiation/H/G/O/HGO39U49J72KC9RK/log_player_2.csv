"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. While $950,000 is a good price, Bob has room to negotiate further."

This price is still a win for you, as it's well above what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's counteroffer is a good deal.  Bob will save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While there is potential for a lower price, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a deal with John at $1,000,000 isn't worth it.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price."
