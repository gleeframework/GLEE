"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $20000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000. Would it be possible for you to adjust your offer to meet this price point?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $18000. This is my final offer within this negotiation. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget by quite a bit. I'm hoping to stay within the $8000 range. Could you possibly reconsider your offer to match my budget constraints?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I've already met you halfway with my previous offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $16000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. I believe we might be able to find common ground if you could reduce your price further to $14000. I understand that's still above my initial budget, but I'm hopeful this might be a feasible compromise. Thank you for your understanding.",14000.0,Bob,6,
