Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy based on his reaction. If he seems interested but can't meet this price, I'll be ready to negotiate downwards, but only if I feel it's worth it to get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than what I could get from John. I need to push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below the $1 million mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a substantial profit.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to give up my desired value just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's higher than his previous one.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $800,000, which is a good outcome considering my minimum value for the product."
