Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a more reasonable starting point for our negotiations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $900,000, but I'm still a bit far from that number.  Let's split the difference once more.  I'm willing to accept $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  It's better to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing. Saving $75,000 isn't worth the potential of losing the deal entirely at this point."
