"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a more reasonable starting point for our negotiations.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While your offer is closer, I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a bit closer, but I'm trying to stay under $900,000. How about we settle at $900,000 even?  That's my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $900,000, but I'm still a bit far from that number.  Let's split the difference once more.  I'm willing to accept $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
