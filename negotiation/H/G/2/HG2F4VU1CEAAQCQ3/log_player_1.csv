"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point that shows I'm willing to be flexible while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not going to sell the product for a loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $130? This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I don't lose money on the sale."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get more, it's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum desired price."
