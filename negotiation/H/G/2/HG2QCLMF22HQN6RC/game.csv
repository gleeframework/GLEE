"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $92.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",92.5,Bob,4,
