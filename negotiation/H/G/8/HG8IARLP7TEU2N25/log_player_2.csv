Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to negotiate with Alice further, it seems we're hitting a stalemate.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy from John."
