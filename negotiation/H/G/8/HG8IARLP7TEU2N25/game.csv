"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. This is my best offer, considering my financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Please consider this carefully.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
