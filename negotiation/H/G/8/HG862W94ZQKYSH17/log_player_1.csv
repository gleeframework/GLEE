Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I can still try to negotiate a better deal with Bob. I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I want to try to push for a price closer to $8,500 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,350.  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 8350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $8250? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,250 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's also only $50 away from my last counteroffer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice, ensuring I secure a sale without jeopardizing my minimum price."
