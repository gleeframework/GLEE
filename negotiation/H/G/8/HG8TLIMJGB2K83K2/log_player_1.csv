Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I think he's willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $825,000, which is slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is also the price that John is willing to pay, so I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price.
