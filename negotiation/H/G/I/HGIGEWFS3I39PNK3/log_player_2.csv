"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is slightly under your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. Alice is starting high, and you have the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000. By rejecting this offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed with John if necessary."
