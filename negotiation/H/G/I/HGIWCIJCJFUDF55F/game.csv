"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend less than that.  Let's start with $950,000. This is a good starting point for both of us, and we can work from there.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.
