"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,100,000 is only $100,000 less than my absolute maximum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend less than that.  Let's start with $950,000. This is a good starting point for both of us, and we can work from there.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  $950,000 is still a good profit for her, and it leaves room for us to negotiate a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to continue negotiating. I have several rounds left, and there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to propose $1,000,000 as a counteroffer. This is my target price, and it's still a good deal for Alice. I'm hoping she will accept, but if not, we have more rounds to work with."
