"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that's worth $12000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $10000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $9,000 is still within his budget and a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer. 
* **Alice's perspective:** $9,000 is still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000), giving her room to profit and potentially accept. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a possibility of getting a slightly better deal, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing the chance to buy from John outweighs the potential gain.  It's a good deal, and Bob should take it."
