"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $165 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $150.  Would you be open to $155?  It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $155. How about we meet in the middle again at $160? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",160.0,Alice,5,
