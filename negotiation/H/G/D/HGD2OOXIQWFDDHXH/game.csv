"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Could you consider a price closer to that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for this product. It's high quality and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider meeting me at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
