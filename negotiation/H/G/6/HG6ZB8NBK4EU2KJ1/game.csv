"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counter-offer and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm proposing $8,250. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want.  Let me know if you're interested.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you are tough negotiator!  I can appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,900. Hopefully this gets us closer to a deal.",7900.0,Bob,6,
