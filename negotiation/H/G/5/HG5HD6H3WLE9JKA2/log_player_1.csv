Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I know you'll find immense value in it.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our own minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price above our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob's acceptance. 

**Important Note:** If Bob were to counter-offer, we'd have the security of John's offer as our absolute bottom line."
