Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but also leaves room for negotiation, reflecting that I'm open to reaching a deal with Bob while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John and is a reasonable compromise considering the previous negotiation rounds."
