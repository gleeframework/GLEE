Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $11,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  I've got another buyer interested at a higher price, so I'm going to have to decline your offer.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go below $14,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees the best price for me."
