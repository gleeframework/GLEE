Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price of $20,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm hoping to find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's value and my minimum allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly sought after. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how serious Bob is about the product. If he outright rejects it, I know he's price-sensitive. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. I don't want to drag out negotiations with Bob too long and risk losing both opportunities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchoring:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum and even his own perceived value. He's likely trying to anchor the negotiation in his favor. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between his offer and both my minimum and his value.  This indicates a possibility for negotiation towards a more favorable outcome.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives me leverage to walk away from a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** By countering with $17,000, I'm suggesting a price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and his. This can be perceived as a fair negotiation tactic while still leaving room for further compromise on my end.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm not drastically dropping my price, showing that I'm still valuing the product highly and not desperate to sell. 
* **Keep John in Mind:** I'm staying well above my guaranteed sale price with John, ensuring I'm not leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $11,000? I'm trying to be reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $1,000, indicating he might be hesitant to move significantly towards my price range.  
* **Below My Minimum:** Even if I split the difference again, the price would be around $14,000, still below my absolute minimum. 
* **Time to Leverage John:** It's becoming apparent that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob might require too much compromise on my part. It's strategically advantageous to bring John back into the picture."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $11,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  I've got another buyer interested at a higher price, so I'm going to have to decline your offer.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last attempt to salvage the deal with Bob. I'm setting a firm boundary and making it clear this is non-negotiable.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. It subtly suggests that Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While $14,000 is below my ideal price, it's still above my absolute minimum. I'm willing to accept this slight loss to avoid completely losing the sale. 
* **John as Backup:**  If Bob declines, I can confidently proceed with selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
