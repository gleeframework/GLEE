"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate before resorting to the backup option.  Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum, we'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm very interested in your product, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but we can likely still get a better price.  Let's counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to land closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 800000}
