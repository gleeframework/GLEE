"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $900,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground to make this work for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's seal the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making concessions, and I appreciate that.  $925,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $910,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $910,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a little more. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000. This feels like a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. Let's make this happen.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm committed to making this deal happen, but $915,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm going to push for my final offer of $905,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",905000.0,Bob,8,
