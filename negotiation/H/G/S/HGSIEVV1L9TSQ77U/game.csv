"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your pricing strategy.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10500?  This would give you a good deal, and it's a price I can live with.",10500.0,Alice,3,
