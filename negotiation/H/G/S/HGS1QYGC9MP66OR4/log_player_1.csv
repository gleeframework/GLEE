{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$13,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value that I'm willing to accept it.  I don't want to risk another rejection and end up selling to John for less."
