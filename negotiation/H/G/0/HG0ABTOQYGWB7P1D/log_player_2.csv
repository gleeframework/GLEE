Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.

At $1,200,000, Alice is coming closer to her lowest acceptable price, and we're getting a good deal compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer from Alice at this point, so it's best to accept and secure the deal."
