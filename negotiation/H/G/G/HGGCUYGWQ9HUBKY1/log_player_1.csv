"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to try and build a good relationship with Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm giving Bob a little bit of wiggle room to feel like he can get a good deal, while still ensuring I make a profit.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll need to assess Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. It also falls below my initial offer of $11,500.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob is lowballing me, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This means there's still potential to reach a deal that benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining My Position:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  It sets the stage for me to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you being upfront about your price. However, $9,500 is significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on $10,500.  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear that I won't accept a price below my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm also showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by emphasizing that $10,500 is still a good price for him.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair profit"" and ""good price"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a fair price for my product.  By sticking to my minimum value, I'm setting a strong foundation for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  
* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's still an opportunity to push for a better price.  
* **Building Momentum:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a price that reflects the value of my product.  

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer or risk selling to John.  I'll weigh the potential for a better deal with Bob against the risk of losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $10,250 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $10,750. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to Bob, setting a deadline for him to make a decision.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm still aiming to split the difference, which shows continued compromise but remains above my minimum.
* **Exploring Other Options:**  By mentioning other options, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the opportunity cost of rejecting my offer. This adds a sense of urgency to his decision.

**Strategy:**  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on.  This counteroffer is a calculated risk, but it's my best chance to get as close as possible to my target price while still leaving the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting very close to my minimum, but it still falls short of what I want to get.  
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I'm still willing to take a chance on getting a slightly better price from Bob. 
* **The Risk:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, I believe that a bit more negotiation might result in a higher price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to counteroffer again in the next round, focusing on pushing for a deal closer to $11,000.  However, I need to be aware of the diminishing rounds and be prepared to accept Bob's offer if my counteroffer is rejected."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, and I appreciate your flexibility. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down one last time to $10,600. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Again, I'm stressing that this is my final offer.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to signal that time is running out.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" that allows both of us to walk away happy, emphasizing a win-win scenario.

**Strategy:**  This is a high-stakes move. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept his last offer or sell to John.  However, by pushing for a slightly higher price, I'm still maximizing my chances of getting the best possible deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down one last time, but $10,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. 
* **Close But Not Ideal:** Bob's offer of $10,400 is close to my minimum, but still below my desired price point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could make another counteroffer, there's a high chance that Bob will reject it, leaving me with only one round to sell.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and eliminates the risk of getting a lower price. 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited time and the risk involved in further negotiation, selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible and financially secure option."
