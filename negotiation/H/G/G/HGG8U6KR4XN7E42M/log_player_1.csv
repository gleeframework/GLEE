# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $12,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is too low. However, there's still room for negotiation, and selling to John would be losing out on potential profit.
