"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $86 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer and is still above my minimum value of $80. Accepting this offer ensures I close the deal without taking unnecessary risks."
