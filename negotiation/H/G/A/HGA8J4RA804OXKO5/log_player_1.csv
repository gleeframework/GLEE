Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a favorable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.  Even though it's above his estimated worth, it sets a high point for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states your willingness to find a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling that you're open to offers and counteroffers. 

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, securing a deal with Bob above your minimum price is the ideal scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* There's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counter-offer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $800,000. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about your valuation while giving yourself the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,850,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing flexibility by significantly lowering your initial price. This signals your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong outcome.
* **Justification:** You're not just lowering the price arbitrarily. You're highlighting the ""true value"" and ""benefits"" to subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **Midpoint Approach:** By meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer and his counteroffer, you're suggesting a sense of fairness and encouraging him to do the same. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still significantly above Bob's valuation and your minimum price, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your absolute minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the difference might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away. Negotiations have clearly slowed down, and there's a chance pushing further could jeopardize the deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While selling to John would net you the full $1,500,000, securing $1,400,000 from Bob represents a strong outcome and a successful negotiation."
