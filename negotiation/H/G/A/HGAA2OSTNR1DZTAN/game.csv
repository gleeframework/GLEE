"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
