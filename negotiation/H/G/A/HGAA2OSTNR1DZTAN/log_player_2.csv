"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save money and Alice has moved closer to your target price.  Accepting this offer saves you $1200 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing, and $10,800 is a reasonable price."
