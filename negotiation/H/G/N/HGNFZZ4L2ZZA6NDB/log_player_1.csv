Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This allows for potential profit and leaves space for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **The message is friendly:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that is mutually beneficial and maximizes your profit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my max budget is $120.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is Bob's maximum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $122, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122 is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting closer and I'm running the risk of Bob backing out completely. Accepting his offer allows me to make some profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
