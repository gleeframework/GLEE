Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell for $900,000 as that's below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value a fair deal, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you while still being reasonable for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm not comfortable accepting $950,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, I can't go lower than $1,050,000 at this point. This price is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This offer from Bob aligns with my minimum price for the product, and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might not lead to a higher price.  I'll accept his offer to finalize the deal."
