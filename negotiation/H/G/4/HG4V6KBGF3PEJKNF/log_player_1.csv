Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is tempting, but it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation.
