Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the value I'm looking for as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about $90? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although I could keep negotiating, the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to settle for John's offer is too high. $87.50 is a decent price and I can still make a profit."
