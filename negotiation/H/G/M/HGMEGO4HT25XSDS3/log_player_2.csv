"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, he can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  The ""meet in the middle"" strategy might not be the best way to get the lowest price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to push for a price closer to $105."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $108? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
