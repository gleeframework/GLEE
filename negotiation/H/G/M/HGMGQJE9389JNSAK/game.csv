"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $107 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the value we place on the product while remaining competitive for you. Please let me know if this works for you.",107.0,Alice,3,
