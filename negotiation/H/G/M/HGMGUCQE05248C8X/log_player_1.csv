""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 positions it just below our guaranteed sale price. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $12,000.
* **Confident Approach:** The message conveys value without being overly aggressive.  

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
