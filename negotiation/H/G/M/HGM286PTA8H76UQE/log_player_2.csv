"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $15000 to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, which is still above Bob's desired price.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is a fallback option.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $12,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  I'm very interested in your product, but I need to make sure the price is right for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Show interest:**  Highlighting Bob's interest in the product helps to keep the negotiation going.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The message suggests openness to further discussion, signaling that a deal is possible.
* **Focus on value:** Bob's goal is to save money, so the message emphasizes the need for a price that is ""right"" for him."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work. Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500, which is closer to Bob's target but still leaves some room for improvement.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is still a fallback option.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  Since Alice has already moved down from her initial offer, there's a good chance she will budge further."
