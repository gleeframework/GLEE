"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high but within Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed positively to gauge Bob's enthusiasm and willingness to engage in a potentially quick deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the $800,000 offer from John in mind provides a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Rejecting Bob's offer signals that we're aiming higher while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** We've come down from our initial offer by $50,000, showing flexibility. However, the message emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Proposing $1,050,000 splits the difference between Bob's offer and our previous ask, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** We're still in the early rounds, and this counteroffer encourages Bob to stay engaged and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your valuation of the product. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum acceptable price and a good return on the product.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or further haggling that might not result in a significantly better offer."
