Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering my maximum price of $100. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy from John at this price. If Alice rejects this, I will buy from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still unwilling to come down to my price, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to buy the product from John for $100, which is within my budget and a safer option than continuing to negotiate."
