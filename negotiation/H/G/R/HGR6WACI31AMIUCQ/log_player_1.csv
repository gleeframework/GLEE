Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still allows for a good profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the value proposition for Bob. I want to encourage him to consider the offer without making him feel pressured.

**Why this approach?**

* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  Starting at a price lower than my minimum allows for potential negotiation and avoids immediately shutting down the conversation.
* **Profit Potential:**  While I'm offering a discount, $1,000,000 still represents a good profit for me. 
* **Flexibility:** This approach allows me to assess Bob's interest level and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. This price allows you to make a good return on your investment while still giving me a reasonable profit.  Let's keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $950,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my original asking price. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a profitable deal. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation:** This approach shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for an unfair price. 
* **Profit:** $950,000 is still a good profit margin for me, given my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Flexibility:** By setting a new price, I'm keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob an opportunity to counter.  This allows me to assess his true intentions and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of this product for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it represents a good compromise and a significant profit for me.  

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. 
* **Potential Risk:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away, leaving me with no sale and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Good Profit:** $900,000 is a substantial amount, and I'm confident I can still make a good return on the product. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid further risk or delay."
