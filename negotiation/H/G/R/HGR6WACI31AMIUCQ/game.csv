"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. This price allows you to make a good return on your investment while still giving me a reasonable profit.  Let's keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of this product for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
