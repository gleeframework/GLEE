"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $120?  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? It's still a good price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you won't regret it.  Let's close this deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
