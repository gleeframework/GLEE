Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to engage while also ensuring you capture a substantial portion of the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's crucial to remember that the product is worth more to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on your value. It keeps the negotiations moving and encourages Bob to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price, and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is a safe and reliable option. There's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will lead to a better outcome, and the risk of a prolonged negotiation is not worth taking."
