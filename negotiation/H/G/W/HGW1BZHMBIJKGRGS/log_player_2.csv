"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

You can do better than $1,100,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

You are very close to your goal price of $1,000,000. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if you can get Alice down to your price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept your final offer of $1,000,000. I'm still holding out for a better price, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000.

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,075,000, which is more than you're willing to pay. It's better to buy from John for $1,000,000 to ensure you get the product at your target price."
