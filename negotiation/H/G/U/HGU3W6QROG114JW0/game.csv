"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $730000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.
