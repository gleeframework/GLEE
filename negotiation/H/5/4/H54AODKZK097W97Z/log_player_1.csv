"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $11,000 for this to be worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which would be $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to what I want, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can push for $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to give you one final compromise. Let's settle at $10,250.  It's a fair price for both of us and it avoids further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting closer, we've only got 4 rounds left and I don't think there's enough time to close the deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk losing out on a better offer."
