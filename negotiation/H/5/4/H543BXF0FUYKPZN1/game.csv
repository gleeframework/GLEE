"Bob, I'm offering you the product for a price that's fair to both of us.  It's a valuable item, and I believe you'd find it very useful.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - it's more than I'd get from another buyer, and it's still a significant saving for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,
