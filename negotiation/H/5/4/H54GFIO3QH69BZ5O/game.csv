"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a competitive offer considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less. How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to invest less, but I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement here.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,810000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we split the difference and settle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",785000.0,Bob,6,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $785,000. I'm still a bit above that, so I'm counteroffering at $820,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",820000.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can stretch my budget a bit further, but  $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,8,,
