You can get the product from John for $150, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $120.  You should reject and try to get a better price."

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is still within my budget and a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get a better price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."

I'm offering Alice $110 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer and her latest offer, and hopefully, she'll be more willing to accept it."

Alice is not budging much, and the price is getting close to what John is offering. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  I'll buy the product from John for $150."
