"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than half its value to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
