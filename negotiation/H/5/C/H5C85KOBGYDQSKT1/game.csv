"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a good faith purchase, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than half its value to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
