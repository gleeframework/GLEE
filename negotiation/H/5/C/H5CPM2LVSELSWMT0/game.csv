"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so let's aim for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
