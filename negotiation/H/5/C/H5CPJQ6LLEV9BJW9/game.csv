"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its actual value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this worth my while. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,750. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. Let's work together to find a fair agreement.",7750.0,Bob,4,
