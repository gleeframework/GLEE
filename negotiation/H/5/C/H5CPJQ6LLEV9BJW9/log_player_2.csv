"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price closer to her value of the product.  You always have the option to go to John later if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its actual value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By offering $7,000, you are setting a lower anchor point for the negotiation. This might influence Alice to consider lower prices than she initially intended.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your counteroffer (""fair price considering its actual value"") can make it seem more reasonable and encourage Alice to engage seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this worth my while. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above her value for the product. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $8,000. There's no need to rush to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,750. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. Let's work together to find a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's value but still staying well below her current offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate without giving away too much ground.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing the significant increase from the previous offer can make Alice more receptive to this counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a collaborative and positive tone encourages continued negotiation and a mutually agreeable outcome."
