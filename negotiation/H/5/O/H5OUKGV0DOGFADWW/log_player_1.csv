Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Please let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Framing it as a good deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard deadline or refusing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This initial offer is a starting point, and I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reaffirming the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline, leaving the door open for further discussion and potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $13500 is still above my budget. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $12000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has held firm on his offer of $12,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. Further negotiation might not yield a better result, and the risk of losing the deal to John is real. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a respectable price, mitigating the risk of ending up with nothing."
