"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still unable to go that low.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  However, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  My last offer is $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
