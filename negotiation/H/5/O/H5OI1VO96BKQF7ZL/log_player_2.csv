Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 17% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing I'm serious about buying but also looking for a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above my target price of $75. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe Alice will lower her price further."
