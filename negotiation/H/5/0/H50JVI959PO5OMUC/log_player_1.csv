"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to maximize potential profit.  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so it's best to start high and potentially negotiate down.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is positive and encouraging, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is not outrageous, leaving room for negotiation without making Bob feel like I'm trying to take advantage. 
* **Setting a strong starting point:** This strong starting point makes it clear that I value the product highly, setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value:** While Bob's offer is a good start, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there is room for further negotiation. Bob clearly has interest in the product, and a counteroffer might lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John for $10,000 is guaranteed, I have 10 rounds and the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 

**Next steps:**  I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This will show that I am willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Maintaining value:** The price is still above my minimum and allows for potential profit.
* **Encouraging negotiation:** The message is friendly and suggests a final deal, pushing Bob to close the deal. 
* **Stronger position:** By countering with a lower price, I'm making a stronger case for my initial asking price while demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Significant negotiation progress:** We are making significant progress in the negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is premature:** While selling to John is a guaranteed deal, I still have time and a good chance of getting a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my last offer, but still above Bob's offer. This will continue demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my goal of getting a price above $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:** I'm again demonstrating my willingness to compromise by offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining value:** The price is still above my minimum and allows for potential profit.
* **Encouraging negotiation:** The message is friendly and suggests a final deal, pushing Bob to close the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with his slightly increased offer, Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Strong potential for a better deal:** We've made significant progress, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price.  Bob is clearly very interested in the product and getting closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still premature:** While selling to John is a guaranteed deal, I still have time and a good chance of getting a better price from Bob. 

**Next steps:**  I will make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my last offer but still above Bob's offer, keeping the pressure on him to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close to a deal!  I'm willing to go down to $12,900. This is my final offer, and it's a great price for a product that will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm setting a firm price, indicating I'm close to my limit.  
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I emphasize the value of the product to him, adding incentive to close the deal. 
* **Slightly lower than my previous offer:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, but showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.  
* **Time pressure:** We're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, increasing pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Next steps:**  I'm confident this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. However, if he rejects, I'll have to reassess whether I want to risk another round or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time and diminishing returns:** We are now in round 8, with only 2 rounds remaining. There's a risk of getting stuck in a back-and-forth with Bob and not reaching a satisfactory price.
* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While his offer is slightly above my minimum of $10,000, it's not significantly higher. There's a possibility that further negotiation will result in a lower price, or we could reach a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a sale and ensures I won't lose out on my minimum value. 

**Conclusion:** Considering the time constraint and potential for a less favorable outcome with Bob, selling to John for $10,000 is the most pragmatic decision at this point. It guarantees a sale and protects my minimum desired profit."
