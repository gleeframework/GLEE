"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I like it, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $11,000 to be comfortable. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? That would work much better for my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I want to keep the negotiation going. I can offer you a compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is close, but I have a strict budget for this purchase. If you're willing to come down to $10,000, I'm ready to buy right now. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle between $10,000 and $10,500. How about $10,250? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product",10250.0,Alice,7,
