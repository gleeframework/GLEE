"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, while also being closer to your target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a step in the right direction. Bob should reject the offer and try to get even closer to his target.  He can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his initial offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product while continuing to push for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $885,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and is within Bob's budget. It's a fair compromise that allows both parties to benefit. Rejecting this offer would risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
