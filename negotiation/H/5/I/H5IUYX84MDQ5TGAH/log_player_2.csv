"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,000, but it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since he can get the same product from John for his budget, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
