Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept his offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. It's a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer of $800,000, which is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made a significant concession in the previous round, and I don't see any chance of him increasing his offer.  To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation that may yield no results, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
