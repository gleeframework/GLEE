Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a strong opening position, giving me room to negotiate down if needed.  It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll be watching for his reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to accept my minimum of $8,000, and John is offering that. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
