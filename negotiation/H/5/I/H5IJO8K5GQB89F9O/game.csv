"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is a 15% discount from the original price. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the fair value of the product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to your budget. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is a good price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
