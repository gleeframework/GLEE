"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm not yet willing to settle. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a potential fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $14,000. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my desired price. I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $15,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
