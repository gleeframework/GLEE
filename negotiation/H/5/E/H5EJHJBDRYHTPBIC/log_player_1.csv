"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is still above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the product's value to me helps establish its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 minimum I've set for myself. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds remaining and the potential to get closer to my desired price through counteroffers.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit, but I'm willing to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $850,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000 to keep things moving forward. This represents a significant concession on my part, but I'm confident the product's value will speak for itself."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, showing a willingness to compromise without giving away too much.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the concession I've made emphasizes its worth.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  I want to encourage Bob to respond and continue the conversation, ideally leading to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Given my budgetary considerations, I am proposing an offer of $860000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $860,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I want to maximize my profit.
* **John's offer is a good backup:** While I want to get a better deal with Bob, John's offer provides a safety net.
* **Potential for more negotiation:**  With six rounds left, I have time to try and get Bob closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $860,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $870,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum, showing flexibility. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Closing urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal this round"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to respond."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $865,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  
* **Four rounds remaining:** I have a decent amount of time left to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  If I don't see a good deal with Bob, I can always sell to John and guarantee a profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $865,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to go down to $875,000.

Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, but still above minimum:**  I'm offering a small decrease from my previous counteroffer, but it's still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility without losing ground.
* **Emphasize value and concession:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth and highlight my willingness to compromise, hoping to convince him to accept.
* **Create urgency:**  I mention the need to reach an agreement this round, adding a sense of finality to encourage a decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and your position. In light of our previous negotiations, I would like to propose an offer of $870000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds remaining:**  There's not a lot of time to continue negotiating, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  By selling to John, I secure a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum target. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or even a complete stalemate, putting my minimum profit at risk.

Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this stage."
