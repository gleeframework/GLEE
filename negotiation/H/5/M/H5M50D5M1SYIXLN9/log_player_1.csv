Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still a profitable sale for me, considering my minimum price of $120.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
