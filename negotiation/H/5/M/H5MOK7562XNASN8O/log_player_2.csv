# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is the market value of the product, I don't see any advantage in paying $142,500 less for the same product.
