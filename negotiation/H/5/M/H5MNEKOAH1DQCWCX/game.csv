"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95?  This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any higher.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $105. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",105.0,Alice,5,
