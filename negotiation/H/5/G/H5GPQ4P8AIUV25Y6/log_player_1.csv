Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point that's closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies there might be some flexibility in the price, encouraging Bob to engage in negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knew about John, he would have no incentive to offer more than $1,200,000. 
*  The success of this negotiation depends on Bob's willingness to pay a premium for the product and your ability to effectively communicate its value to him."
