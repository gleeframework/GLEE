{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $11,999. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, which is her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it at or near this price is unlikely to be successful.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide to lower the price slightly if needed. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency. Bob might feel he needs to act quickly if he wants the product.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer or reject it outright. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still leaving room for a deal with Bob."
