"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than what it costs you. Given its value to you, I propose we agree on a fair price. Would you be interested in discussing a price that would make both of us happy? I'm open to negotiation.",120.0,Alice,1,
