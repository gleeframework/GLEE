"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe the product is a good one, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $10000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $11500? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $11250? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11250. I'm willing to meet you at $10800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm getting close to my budget limit, and I'd like to finalize a deal at this price.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10800. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to get a deal done. How about we meet at $11500? This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
