"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would give you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $9,300.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.  What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,100? I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9100.0,Bob,6,
