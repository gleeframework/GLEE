"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $120, there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, aiming to lower the price closer to the $100 mark.  Buying from John for $150 is not a good option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price. Buying from John at this point is not ideal as it's still significantly higher than the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached round 7, and the negotiation seems to be stuck. Alice is not willing to go lower than $128, and I'm not willing to pay more than $120. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $150. This is a higher price, but it ensures I get the product within the remaining rounds."
