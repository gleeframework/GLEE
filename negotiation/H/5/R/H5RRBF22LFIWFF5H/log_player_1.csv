Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal while leaving you space to negotiate down to $1,500,000 if needed. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly without overthinking. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from either Bob or John."
