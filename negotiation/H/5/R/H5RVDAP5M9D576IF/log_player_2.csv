"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he has a better option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $150 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $165 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He has a guaranteed option with John for $150, so it's better to go with that."
