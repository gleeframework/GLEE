Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still remaining comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

By using this strategy, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while maximizing my potential profit."
