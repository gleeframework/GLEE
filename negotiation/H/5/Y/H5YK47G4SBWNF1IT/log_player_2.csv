"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be open to $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to be fair. You're offering a price that's lower than Alice's original offer but still above her minimum value. This gives Alice a reason to consider your offer without feeling like she's being taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $87.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $87.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $86. I believe this is a fair price considering our both needs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to compromise further but still pushing for a lower price.  Offering a price just slightly lower than Alice's counteroffer demonstrates your seriousness about purchasing while leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $86 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $88? I think it's a good balance between our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown flexibility, but $88 is still a bit higher than your ideal price point. You've already successfully negotiated her down from her initial offer of $90. Continuing the negotiation offers the potential to reach a price closer to your target of $85 or even lower. There are still rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $85.  How about we settle on $87? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again shows a willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice. It's a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your seriousness, but still lower than Alice's last offer.  This makes it a potentially attractive compromise for Alice, while still keeping you within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $89? I think it's a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is getting close to your limit of $100. You've been successful in negotiating her down from $90, but it seems unlikely she'll go any lower.  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to pay $100 from John is increasing. It's more prudent to secure the product from John at this point and avoid the potential of a deadlock with Alice."
