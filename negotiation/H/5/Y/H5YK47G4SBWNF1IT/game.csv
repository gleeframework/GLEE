"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be open to $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $87.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $87.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $86. I believe this is a fair price considering our both needs.  Let me know what you think.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $86 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $88? I think it's a good balance between our needs.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $85.  How about we settle on $87? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let me know what you think.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $89? I think it's a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",89.0,Alice,7,
