"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your ideal price.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still a bit high. You have more rounds to go and could potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to your target price of $1,000,000.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a much higher price is significant.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid potential complications."
