"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's work together to find a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000,  which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he will reach the $15,000 mark I can get from John. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 now than risk getting less from Bob."
