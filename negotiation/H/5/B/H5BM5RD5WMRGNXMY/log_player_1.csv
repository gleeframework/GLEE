Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $12,000, so I can't go lower than that.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I know I can't ask for much more than that. 
* **Negotiation Space:** By offering $11,000, I leave some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than his initial assessment.
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 

This offer allows me to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and a higher profit.

Since Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round. If not, I'll go with the guaranteed profit from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need at least $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.
* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob offered $9,500, which is too low.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still standing firm on my need to make a decent profit.
* **John's Offer:** This offer is still lower than John's, so I'm not risking much by trying to reach a deal with Bob.

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that might convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Limits:** It's clear Bob isn't willing to go much higher. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and a better profit than Bob's offer. 

While I would prefer to make a higher profit, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when John is offering a guaranteed deal that meets my requirements."
