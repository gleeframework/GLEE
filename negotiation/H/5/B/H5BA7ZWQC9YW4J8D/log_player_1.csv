Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" without explicitly revealing your minimum. This encourages Bob to consider its potential worth beyond his initial $8,000 valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message expresses willingness to discuss the price, demonstrating flexibility and inviting Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, it's strategically better to secure a deal with Bob if possible, as aiming higher could result in a higher profit margin.

**Important Note:** This initial offer is just the first step.  How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price while always keeping your $15,000 minimum in mind."
