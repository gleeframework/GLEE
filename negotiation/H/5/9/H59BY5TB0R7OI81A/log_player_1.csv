Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has clearly stated his absolute maximum price is $800,000. It's highly unlikely he'll budge beyond this point.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and sell to John.  You'll lose potential profit by continuing with Bob, while John offers a guaranteed, acceptable price."
