"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $95 for it. Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's price, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
