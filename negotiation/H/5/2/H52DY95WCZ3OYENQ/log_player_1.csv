Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $9,500 is significantly below what I consider a fair price given the product's potential value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price allows for a good margin for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even though it's right at the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still better than selling to John and I can close the deal without further negotiation."
