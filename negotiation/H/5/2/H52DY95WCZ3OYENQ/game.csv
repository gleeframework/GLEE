"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $9,500 is significantly below what I consider a fair price given the product's potential value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price allows for a good margin for both of us.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
