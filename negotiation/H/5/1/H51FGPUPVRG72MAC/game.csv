"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, how about $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, and I appreciate you working with me. It's a good product, but to be honest, $7,200 is a little bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000 even? That would really help me out.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",7100.0,Alice,7,
