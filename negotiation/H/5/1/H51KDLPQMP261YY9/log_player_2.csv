"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. Let's start with a fair price. Would you consider purchasing the product for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $100, $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $85 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To better align with your budget, I am willing to consider $78 as the price for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The offer is now within my budget and a good compromise.  Accepting it saves me $22 compared to buying from John."
