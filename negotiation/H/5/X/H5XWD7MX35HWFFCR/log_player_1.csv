Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay that amount, there's no incentive for me to lower the price.  Bob can choose to accept the offer and get the product for a price that's higher than its worth to him, or he can reject it, but I'll still get my desired price from John."
