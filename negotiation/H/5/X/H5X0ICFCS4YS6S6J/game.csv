"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's meet at $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a good return for you. I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
