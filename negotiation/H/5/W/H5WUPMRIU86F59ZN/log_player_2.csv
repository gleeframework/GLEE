{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can definitely do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also below your maximum budget of $15,000, leaving you some wiggle room if Alice counters."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous one, showing you're willing to compromise. It's still well below Alice's latest offer, but it demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product. This gives you a good chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still within your range. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a higher price, potentially pushing you closer to your $15,000 limit with John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still favorable compared to John's offer."
