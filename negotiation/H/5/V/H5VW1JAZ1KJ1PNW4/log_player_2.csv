# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While her message tries to inflate the product's value to you, it's a significant saving compared to John's offer."
