Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **It's attractive to Bob:** The price is still below his maximum value, meaning he gets a good deal.
* **It's profitable for you:**  You earn $1,500 more than you would from selling to John.
* **Minimizes risk:**  While there's always a chance Bob rejects, the price is sufficiently attractive to make it likely he'll accept."
