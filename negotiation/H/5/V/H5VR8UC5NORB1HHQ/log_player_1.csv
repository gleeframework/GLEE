"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $950,000. I have 8 rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal, I'm sure you'll find the product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I want to see if I can get closer to $900,000 before I consider accepting. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still unable to accept $875,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps the deal moving forward.  Let's seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $887,500.  It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's likely that further negotiations will only result in minor price adjustments. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
