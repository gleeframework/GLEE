"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in this price range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I still believe that $800000 would be a fair price for both of us. Would it be possible to meet at that figure?",800000.0,Bob,4,
