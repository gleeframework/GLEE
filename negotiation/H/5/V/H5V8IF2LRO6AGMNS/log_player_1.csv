Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be persuasive and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting high gives me the potential to earn a significant profit. 
* **Negotiation Space:** It allows for a negotiation process where Bob might counteroffer, giving us both opportunities to find a middle ground.
* **Back-up Plan:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures I won't be stuck with a price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in this price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate Further:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting immediately, I show I'm not desperate and maintain leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's a chance I can secure a higher price with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer to Bob that reflects my value for the product while remaining within a range that might entice him to agree."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This makes my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Middle Ground:** By proposing a ""meet in the middle"" approach, I'm suggesting a fair deal that could be appealing to Bob.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Balanced Approach:** It's a compromise that acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while still getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Agreement:** $900,000 might be within a range where Bob is willing to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I'm still maintaining control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I still believe that $800000 would be a fair price for both of us. Would it be possible to meet at that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $800,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a sale at my minimum acceptable price. 

**Why this is the best decision:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price, guaranteeing a profit.
* **No Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower price or an extended negotiation process that might not lead to an agreement. 
* **Time and Effort:** Selling to John saves time and effort compared to further negotiation with Bob.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, securing $1,000,000 is a good outcome given the circumstances."
