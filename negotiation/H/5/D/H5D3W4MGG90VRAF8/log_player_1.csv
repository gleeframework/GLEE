"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true significance and potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a high but not outrageous offer sets a strong tone and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""exceptional value"" and ""true significance,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering at $1,500,000 allows for potential counteroffers and concessions while still aiming for a significantly higher sale price than our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Considering the product's worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's significantly lower than our minimum and his own perceived value.  Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** Show Bob we believe the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Negotiate Towards a Better Deal:**  We have ample rounds to work towards a price closer to our target. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  It's crucial for me to reach an agreement that reflects its true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Redirect:** We acknowledge Bob's counter-offer but reiterate that it doesn't match the product's worth.
* **Significant Concession (But Not Too Much):** Dropping to $1,250,000 is a considerable concession from $1,500,000, showing flexibility but still aiming high.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This language encourages a collaborative negotiation approach while suggesting a price point still favorable to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I am still seeking a price closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to negotiate further, the gains are likely to be small, and each round carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling.
* **Securing a Profitable Deal:** Accepting now locks in a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
