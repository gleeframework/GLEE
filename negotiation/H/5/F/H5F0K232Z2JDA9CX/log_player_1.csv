"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a profit well above my minimum.  I believe this will encourage Bob to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a good profit, while also showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, and it's still a decent profit for me. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $14,000,  accepting this offer is the best option to ensure a sale and secure a profit within the remaining rounds."
