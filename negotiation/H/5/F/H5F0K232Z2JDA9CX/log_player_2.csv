{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $15,000 from John, and Alice's offer is only slightly better.  There's a good chance Bob can get a lower price by negotiating with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $15,000. Offering $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, giving her some room to negotiate while still providing Bob with a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $15,000. Alice's offer is better than her previous offer, but it's still not as good as what Bob can get from John.  There's a chance Bob can get a lower price by negotiating with Alice further."
