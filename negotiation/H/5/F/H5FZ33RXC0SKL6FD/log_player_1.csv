"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than his first offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my value with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth a bit more.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects its value and gives you a solid return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell yet, and I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,012,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $990,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that we are running out of rounds.  To ensure I reach my minimum price goal, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This is a safe option that guarantees my minimum desired profit."
