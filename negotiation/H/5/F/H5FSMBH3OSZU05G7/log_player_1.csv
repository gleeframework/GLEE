Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $120, I aim slightly higher than his valuation. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if he perceives the deal as good.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  I know John will pay $150, which is my safety net. I want to maximize my profit, so I aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than John's. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal. This might make him more receptive to the offer even if it's slightly above his perceived value."
