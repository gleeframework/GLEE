"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider $7,500? That would work much better for my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
