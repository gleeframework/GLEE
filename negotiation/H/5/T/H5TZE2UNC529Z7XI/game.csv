"Hello Alice, thank you for offering to sell the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $17,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your position, but $15,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $16,000 is beyond my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $15,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
