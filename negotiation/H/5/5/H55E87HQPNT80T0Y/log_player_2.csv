{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a lower offer, significantly less than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  This signals my seriousness in buying the product while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's closer than her initial price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly, but still below my maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, while still trying to get the best price possible.  It's close enough to her offer that she might be more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my ideal budget. I'm comfortable buying from John at $10,000, which is my maximum limit.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and I'm not willing to risk losing the opportunity to get the product at my target price."
