Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

Here's why this offer strategy makes sense:

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. However, the increase isn't so drastic that it's likely to scare Bob away immediately.
* **Highlight Value and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the offer as an exclusive opportunity, potentially increasing its perceived desirability.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from overthinking or seeking alternative options.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. A lot depends on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance. You could potentially offer a lower price if you believe Bob is highly price-sensitive or if you prioritize a quick and certain sale."
