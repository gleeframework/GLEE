Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob might secure a quicker sale.
* **High but Negotiable:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept before losing the opportunity. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price from Bob while also acknowledging the guaranteed offer from John."
