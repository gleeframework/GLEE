"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point.  I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. How about $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to close a deal, accepting such a low offer would be a loss for me.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a compromise from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'd like to propose $135 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. It's very close to my ""sell to John"" price of $150, and I want to try to maximize my profit. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $140.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer but still a fair compromise. I'm keeping the negotiation moving towards my preferred price point while acknowledging his efforts to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $137 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us having to go back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140 again, hoping that Bob will finally accept.  It's a compromise that's within both of our price ranges.  I'm trying to make a deal with Bob but will still have the option to sell to John if he rejects this final offer."
