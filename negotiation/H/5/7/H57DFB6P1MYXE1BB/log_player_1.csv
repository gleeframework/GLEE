"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so it's my baseline. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so he has room to negotiate.  There's a chance he might accept, and even if he doesn't, it establishes a starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below what I'd get from John. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I still think there's room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and try to get another $10,000-20,000 out of him. I have 6 rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm offering $940,000, which is closer to Bob's latest offer.  He's clearly willing to pay more than $900,000, and I want to see if he'll go a bit higher.  We're getting close, but I have 5 rounds left to try and squeeze out a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $930,000 is very close to my desired price. I have only 4 rounds left and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  While I would love to get my full $1,000,000,  $930,000 is a good result."
