"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is within my budget, I want to see if I can get a better price. There's no downside to rejecting and making a counteroffer in the first round.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price that is still attractive to me, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, keeping in mind that I have 7 rounds left.  I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but not the full $95 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  However, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $95, and I have 6 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $92, which is a good price considering my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, or that I could reach the end of the negotiation rounds without a deal.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price.  It's only $2 more than my last counteroffer, and I'm comfortable with that."
