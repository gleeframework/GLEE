"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $11,000? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
