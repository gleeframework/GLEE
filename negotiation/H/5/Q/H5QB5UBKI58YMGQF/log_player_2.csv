"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's aim for a quick resolution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still above your ideal price point.  You have several more rounds to negotiate, and you can likely get closer to your target of $1,200,000. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially save more money."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer $1,337,500.  This represents a significant concession from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,337,500, which is still a bit higher than where you want to be, but you are approaching your goal of $1,200,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  You can likely get to your goal by continuing to reject offers and counter-offering."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,337,500 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
