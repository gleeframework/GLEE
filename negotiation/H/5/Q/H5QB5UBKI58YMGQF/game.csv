"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer $1,337,500.  This represents a significant concession from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,337,500 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
