Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's aim for a quick resolution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still a bit lower than my ideal price. I'd like to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer $1,337,500.  This represents a significant concession from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1337500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,337,500 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, I risk losing out on a sale altogether if I continue to reject. It's better to take the offer now and secure a sale."
