"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000 is a good strategy. It shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is still well below your maximum budget, and it also leaves a good margin for Alice to still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement. It's likely she's willing to come down further, especially since you've shown you're serious about getting a good deal with your previous counteroffer.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This counteroffer of $800,000 is a compromise, showing that you're willing to meet her halfway. It's also very close to her own valuation of the product, making it a very attractive offer for her. This gives Alice a good profit margin while still saving you $50,000 compared to her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000. This is a good price for you and a good profit for Alice. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also increases the risk of the negotiation falling apart, or Alice getting a better offer from someone else.  It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
