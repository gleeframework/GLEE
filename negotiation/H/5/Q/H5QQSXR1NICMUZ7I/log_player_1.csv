Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob a sense of control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his offer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial perceived value of $100. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I can likely get a price closer to my desired range by continuing the negotiation.

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $145, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, feels fair and signals a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our prices while maintaining a price point that's still favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is becoming tedious:**  We've been going back and forth, and there's a chance we'll continue to haggle without reaching a satisfactory price for me.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum. 

It's more efficient and less risky to sell to John and ensure a profit that's acceptable to me.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential gains are not worth the risk of further negotiation."
