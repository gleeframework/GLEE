# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it and I'm willing to make a compromise to make it happen. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $9,500 saves you $500 compared to buying from John for $10,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Although you're paying more than the product's value to Alice ($8,000), you're still getting it for less than your maximum value ($10,000)."
