"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $25,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $25,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $21,000?",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but that's the highest I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",19000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again. How about $20,000?  This is a great deal for a product of this quality.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",19500.0,Bob,6,
