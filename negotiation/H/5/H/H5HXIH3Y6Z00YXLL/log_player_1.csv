Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
