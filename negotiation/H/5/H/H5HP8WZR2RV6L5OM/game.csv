"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This price reflects the product's value and allows you to stay within a reasonable budget. ",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still not quite there yet.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, so I'll offer $10,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a final compromise. How about $10,900? This price is a small step closer to your offer and reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  It's an opportunity for us both to close this deal and move forward.",10900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, just like I offered in Round 6. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,8,
