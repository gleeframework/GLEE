"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. My initial price is $1,400,000, reflecting the significant value I know it holds. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While your offer is tempting, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I want to try and squeeze out a bit more value from the deal, as the product is worth significantly more to Bob than my minimum. Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,275,000. This price reflects the value this product holds and would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a small compromise to get this deal done, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 4 more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can still push for a higher price. Selling to John would be a loss, and I'm confident I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product. I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to drop my price slightly and offer $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get this deal done, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final two rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely that we will be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's better to sell to John at this point and secure a guaranteed profit rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price or no sale at all."
