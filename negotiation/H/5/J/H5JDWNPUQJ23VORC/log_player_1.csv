Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I can't go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500 is a bit too high. Can you consider $9,250? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, he's doing so very slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. Selling to John now guarantees a fair price without the risk of further drawn-out negotiations."
