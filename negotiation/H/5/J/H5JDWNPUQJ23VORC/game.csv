"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I can't go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500 is a bit too high. Can you consider $9,250? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9250.0,Bob,4,,
