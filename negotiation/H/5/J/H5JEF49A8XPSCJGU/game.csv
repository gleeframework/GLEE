"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $100, which is my minimum price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $95. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
