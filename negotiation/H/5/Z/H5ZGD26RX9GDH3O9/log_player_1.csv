Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a price higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point, considering your minimum is $150 and Bob values it at $80. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  Ending with ""Are you interested?"" gives Bob a chance to respond without making a concrete counteroffer. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially guide the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a compromise closer to my desired range.  
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 provides me with a strong negotiating position. I can confidently push back against Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm framing it as a compromise and a ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the idea that $150 is a reasonable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $150, I was thinking more like $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  Further negotiation could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures a profit and avoids any risk of a lower offer from Bob. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and minimize the risk of a protracted negotiation with Bob that could lead to a less desirable outcome."
