"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can offer you a fair price of $950,000. This would allow me to acquire the product while also saving some money.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered it carefully, and I would like to propose a price of $960,000. This offers a reasonable compromise between our respective positions.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $970,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",970000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $967,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to look elsewhere.",967500.0,Alice,7,
