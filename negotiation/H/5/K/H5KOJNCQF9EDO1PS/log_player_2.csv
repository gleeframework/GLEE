Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product. To be frank, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm on a price that is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile. Accepting her current offer would exceed your budget, and further counteroffers could risk a stalemate. 

John's offer guarantees you stay within your budget and acquire the product."
