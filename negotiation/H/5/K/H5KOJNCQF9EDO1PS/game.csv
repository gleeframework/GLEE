"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product. To be frank, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
