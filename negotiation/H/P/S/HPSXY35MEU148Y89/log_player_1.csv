{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting that the product is a good fit for Bob, which could pique his interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to determine my next move:

* **Accept:**  If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price above my minimum.
* **Counter Offer:** If Bob counters, I'll weigh his offer against the risk of losing him and selling to John for $12,000.
* **Reject:** If Bob rejects outright, I might need to adjust my strategy and try a lower price or a different approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $12,000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and ultimately selling to John for the same price. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a quick and secure sale."
