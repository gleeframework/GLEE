{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is enticing, $9,500 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at a lower price."
