"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

While $90 is closer to your goal, it's still more expensive than John's offer. You should try to negotiate further or consider John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that.

Alice has come down to your maximum price, and it matches what John offers. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John at this point."
