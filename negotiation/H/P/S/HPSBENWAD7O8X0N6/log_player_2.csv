# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement of $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you $50,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
