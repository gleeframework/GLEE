"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could we agree on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement of $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
