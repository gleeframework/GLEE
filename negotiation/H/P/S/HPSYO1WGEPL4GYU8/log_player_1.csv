Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and also reflects the potential value of the product.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still below my desired price point, and I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining my goal of getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $12,500. This is a decent price, and  although it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired range.  I'm going to accept his offer. There's always a risk of continuing negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price or even having Bob walk away entirely.  It's time to secure the deal."
