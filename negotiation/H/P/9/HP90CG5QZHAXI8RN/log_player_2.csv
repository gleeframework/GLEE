"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to him ($1,200,000), there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Considering the product's value and our shared desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price of $900,000.  While Bob can potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further. At this point, accepting the offer saves Bob $350,000 compared to buying from John, which makes it the most financially advantageous option."
