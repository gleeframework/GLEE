Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $70. It's worth another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I think $75 is still a bit low. How about we aim for $82.50, like I mentioned earlier?

Alice seems firm on $82.50 and isn't budging further.  While it's not ideal, it's still a better deal than John's offer of $100. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
