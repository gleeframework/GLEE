"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $8000. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new offer. How about we meet at $9000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'm thinking of a price of $10200. It's still a good deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer. How about we meet at $9500? I think that's as low as I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's still a good deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $8000, which would be $9250. I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",9250.0,Bob,8,
