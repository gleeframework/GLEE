{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's an incentive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a bit more.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,250 isn't my ideal price, it's very close to my target and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. It's also likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price."
