Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
