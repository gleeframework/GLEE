"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you first as I believe you would find a lot of value in it. I'd be willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate lower than $14,000 since the product is only worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand your perspective.  While $14,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is a good compromise and within Bob's budget.  It's also a better price than what John is offering.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for less than his initial budget, and he avoids the risk of further negotiations."
