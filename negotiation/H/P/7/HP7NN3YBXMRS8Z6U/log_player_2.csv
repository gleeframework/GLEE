Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I can do $17,000, and that's my final offer. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial price and has even presented a ""final offer"".  It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in further rounds.  Buying from John at $15,000 is the best option at this point to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price."
