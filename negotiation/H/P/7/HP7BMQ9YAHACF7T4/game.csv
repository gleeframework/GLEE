"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested!",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $750000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer right now.  I'm willing to go up to $700000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $700000. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",725000.0,Alice,5,
