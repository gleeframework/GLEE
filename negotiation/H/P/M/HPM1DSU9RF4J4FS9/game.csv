"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $760,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit outside my budget. To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $800,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
