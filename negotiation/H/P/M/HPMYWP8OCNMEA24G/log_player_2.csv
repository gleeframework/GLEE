"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth a lot to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. How about we start at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to pay no more than $150, and her initial offer is $135. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.** You have the option to buy from John for $150 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we start at $125?  It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me think about it for a moment. In light of our previous discussion, how about I offer you the product for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** You're aiming for $125 or lower.
* **You're still in a strong negotiating position.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have several rounds left to work with her.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.**  It's a backup if you can't get a better price from Alice. 

**Strategy:**  You can likely get Alice to come down a bit more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for the offer. $130 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'd be happy to pay $127 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within our budgets."", ""product_price"": 127}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe we can reach an agreement. Would $128 be acceptable to you, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $128 is just $3 above your ideal price of $125.
* **You have limited rounds left.** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **John is still an option.** While you can still buy from John, you'll be paying a premium compared to Alice's current offer.

**Strategy:** It's likely that you won't get a lower price from Alice, and with limited rounds left, accepting this offer is the most logical choice to get a decent deal."
