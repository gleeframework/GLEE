"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $175? That's still a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $175. How about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more. How about $140? This would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,6,
