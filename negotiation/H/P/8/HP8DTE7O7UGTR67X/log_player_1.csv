Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum price of $10,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.
