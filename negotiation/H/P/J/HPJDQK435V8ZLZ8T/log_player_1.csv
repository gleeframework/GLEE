Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm setting the price at $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""public listing"" and ""other interest"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is ambitious, it's not so outrageous that Bob will immediately walk away. It allows for a counter-offer and potential compromise.

Remember: Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, she's still in a good position to get a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price."
