Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,120,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $80,000 compared to John's price. It's a good deal and not worth risking further negotiation."
