"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to exceed your expectations. With its exceptional quality and functionality, it truly stands out in its category. I believe you would appreciate its value and find it worth more than $80. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $120 for this product. This offers a fair compromise between its worth to us and the value it could bring to you. I look forward to your consideration.",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure if it's worth $120 to me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you and the value it could bring to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
