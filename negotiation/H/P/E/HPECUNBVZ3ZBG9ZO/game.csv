"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value to you will exceed that figure. Let's compromise at $1350000. This price allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be able to show a decent return on investment. Can we discuss $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
