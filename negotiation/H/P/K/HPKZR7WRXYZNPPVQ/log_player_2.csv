"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. There's room to lower the price. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If negotiations fail, you can still secure the product for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I need to come in lower to make it work for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting with a lower offer gives you leverage.  It's well below Alice's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is straightforward and explains your position. 
* **Focus on Value:**  You're not just throwing out a random number. You're making it clear that you're serious about buying the product and have a specific price in mind."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product.

* **John's offer is still a backup:** You can always secure the product for $1,000,000, so you have room to hold out for a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $1,025,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,007,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,012,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's still $12,500 over your target price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only three rounds left, the chance of getting Alice down to your price is slim.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  You can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John.  This is the best outcome for your budget.

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of not getting a deal and having to pay more to John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price from Alice.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
