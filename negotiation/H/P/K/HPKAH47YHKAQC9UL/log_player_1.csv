Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $105 is still below my minimum price, and I'm not desperate to sell. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $105 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've only got 4 rounds left. It's not worth risking getting a worse deal or running out of time. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
