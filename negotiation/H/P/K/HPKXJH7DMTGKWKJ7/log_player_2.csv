# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will be a significant asset to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a price point that I believe is fair for both of us, allowing you to secure a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. It falls well below your $1,500,000 maximum and saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
