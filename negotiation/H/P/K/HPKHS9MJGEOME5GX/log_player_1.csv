{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can always lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but you also have the option to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to negotiate a higher price, potentially closer to my desired $9,500.  I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for this product, and it allows for some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $9,000 I offered. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, but if he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $8,750 twice, making it clear that he is unlikely to budge any further. At this point, it's clear that I can get a significantly better deal from John, who is willing to pay $10,000.  While $8,750 is not a terrible deal, it's below my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant loss compared to selling to John.  I'm choosing to sell to John to maximize my profit."
