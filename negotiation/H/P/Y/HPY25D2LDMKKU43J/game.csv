"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the $15,000 price point is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. Could you meet me closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $18,000. How about $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
