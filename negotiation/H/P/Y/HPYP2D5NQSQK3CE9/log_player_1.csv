Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($2,000,000), you set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially influencing him to consider a price higher than he initially might have. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have John as a backup who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage and confidence in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean no profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the safety net of John's offer, allowing you to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $2,000,000 is still significantly below its true value to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're signaling a willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing your initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,750,000 counteroffer is still comfortably above both Bob's valuation and your minimum, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to stretch his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest.  Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob is moving closer to your minimum, $1,350,000 is still significantly less than your goal and what John is offering.
* **Potential Upside:** Bob's message indicates he might be willing to go even higher.  He's showing more flexibility, and there's a chance to secure a price closer to your target. 
* **John as Leverage:** You still have the option of selling to John for your desired price, giving you a strong position to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be fair,  $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** You're continuing to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price further, but not drastically. 
* **Above Minimum:** The $1,600,000 offer keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price and leaves a little room for a final concession from Bob, if necessary.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing this as a ""fair compromise,"" you're subtly suggesting it might be your final offer without explicitly saying so. This can nudge Bob toward a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a final price closer to $1,400,000.  This would allow us to both come away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  Bob is unlikely to meet your $1,500,000 minimum. His latest offer and message suggest he's unwilling to move much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob has diminishing returns. You risk losing the guaranteed offer from John.
* **Securing the Best Deal:** John's offer provides the best outcome, meeting your desired price without further negotiation."
