"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $2,000,000 is still significantly below its true value to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest.  Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be fair,  $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a final price closer to $1,400,000.  This would allow us to both come away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
