"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  That's the absolute most I can spend right now.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you're not able to accept that, I may have to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $120. I'm happy to buy the product at that price, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to make a small profit. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
