# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $175 is way above my budget. I'll reject and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  That's the absolute most I can spend right now."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$140 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try another counteroffer.  I might consider buying from John later if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you're not able to accept that, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still hesitant to spend more than $120, but I'll see if I can get Alice to come down a bit more. I'm close to my limit, so I might have to consider buying from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $120. I'm happy to buy the product at that price, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to make a small profit. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

I'm not willing to go above $120, and Alice seems set on $125. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, even though it's not ideal.  I've already spent too much time negotiating."
