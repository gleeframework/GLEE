This offer is far too high. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this product realizes its full value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Bob should continue to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still above his maximum budget, and there's room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making a deal, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. Let's be completely transparent. I have another buyer ready to purchase this product for $1,500,000. To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price given the circumstances. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this is a better price, Bob should still try to negotiate further.  He knows that John is willing to sell for $1,200,000, so he has room to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering your alternative buyer. If you're truly interested in a deal, let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
