Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making a deal, let's meet in the middle.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering your alternative buyer. If you're truly interested in a deal, let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While selling to John would yield the guaranteed $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 makes the most sense strategically at this point:

* **Significant Movement:** Bob has increased his offer by $100,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob without a guaranteed better outcome with John (who might not wait indefinitely).
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 is still a substantial profit, and exceeding Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) is a win."
