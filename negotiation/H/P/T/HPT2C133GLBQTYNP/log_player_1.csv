Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your aspirational target. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is grounded in its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a successful deal."
