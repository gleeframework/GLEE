Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely, giving you the opportunity to increase the price further.

Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we do  $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the value you placed on the product and your initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting his offer, you maintain leverage and can counter with a price that's more favorable to you. You can use his counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust your next offer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's a fair price, and I think it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate while still holding out for a better price.  Splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By proposing a price still higher than his offer, you show you're not desperate to sell at his price and still have room to negotiate.
* **Positivity:**  Framing the offer as a ""win-win"" can increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, and you can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer.  Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Pushing for a higher price might lead to a stalemate, and I risk Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I could lose the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Profit is secured:**  $1,075,000 is still a significant profit, and I can't guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal and avoid the potential for a more unfavorable outcome."
