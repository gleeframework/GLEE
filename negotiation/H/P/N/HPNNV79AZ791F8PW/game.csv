"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Considering the value of our product to you, we are willing to negotiate further. Our counteroffer is $1300000. We hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's the absolute maximum I can go.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
