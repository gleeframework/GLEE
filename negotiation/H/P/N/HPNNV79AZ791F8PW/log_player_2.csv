"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. This exceptional item has been meticulously crafted to meet your highest standards. We believe its value far exceeds $1200000 to you. Our initial offer is $1500000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While she claims the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, I have a clear upper limit of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my serious interest in the product while still staying within my budget.  $1,100,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Considering the value of our product to you, we are willing to negotiate further. Our counteroffer is $1300000. We hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum budget.  Although she's shown some flexibility, I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's the absolute maximum I can go.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is my maximum budget. I'm making a significant compromise by moving up from my previous offer.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer, emphasizing the urgency of reaching an agreement.
* **Framing it Positively:**  I'm focusing on the ""mutual benefit"" and the opportunity to ""close the deal,"" making it more appealing for Alice to accept."
