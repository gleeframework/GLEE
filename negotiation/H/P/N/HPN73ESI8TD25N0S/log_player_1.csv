"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value, but still allows me to make a good profit. I'm hoping to secure a deal quickly without risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better price, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $88. It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a decent profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to accept his offer of $84 to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $80."
