"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While the initial offer is high, the message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the price to some extent.
* **Anchoring:**  This high initial offer acts as an anchor.  Even though Bob's valuation is lower, anchoring can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's worth negotiating further, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we consider $1,900,000? This offer takes into account some of your concerns while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  The counteroffer drops by $400,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price remains significantly above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value, justifying a higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message frames the counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need a price closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's try to find a compromise in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price and my guaranteed sale price with John.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a substantial jump from Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. To show I'm serious about making a deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair offer given the product's potential value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer represents a substantial decrease of $300,000 from my previous offer. This signals flexibility and a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** While a significant concession, the offer is still substantially above my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Justification and Urgency:** The message reinforces the product's value while subtly introducing a sense of urgency by highlighting the compromise being made. 

I'm hoping that this large concession will encourage Bob to make a more substantial move towards my price range.  However, I need to be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution closer to the middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $1,200,000?  This would allow me to acquire the product while still staying within my financial limits.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Guarantee:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,200,000 is still less than what John is offering.  
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Accepting at this point would mean losing out on potential profit.
* **Time to Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to signal that my price floor is firm. 

Bob is clearly interested, but he needs to significantly improve his offer for me to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to counteroffer one more time, but I'll be much firmer in this next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but we need to be realistic. This product has significant value, and $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect that. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a very small margin from my guaranteed offer from another buyer, and I'm only offering it because I believe in the potential of this product for you. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the seriousness of the negotiation.
* **Slight Concession, Strong Justification:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm heavily emphasizing the value of the product and my alternative buyer (John).
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning a ""decision soon,"" I'm implicitly reminding Bob that I have other options and won't wait indefinitely.

This strategy aims to secure a deal close to my minimum acceptable price while also leaving Bob with a feeling that he's gotten a reasonable deal."
