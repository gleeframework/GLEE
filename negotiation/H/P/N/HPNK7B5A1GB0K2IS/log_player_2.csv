{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far above my maximum budget of $800,000. There's no point in accepting this offer. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we consider $1,900,000? This offer takes into account some of your concerns while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still too high. While she is showing some flexibility, it's still well above my budget. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need a price closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's try to find a compromise in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. To show I'm serious about making a deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair offer given the product's potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is showing some good faith by coming down to $1,600,000, it's still outside my budget. I'm committed to getting this product, but I need to see a price closer to my limit. I'll reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution closer to the middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $1,200,000?  This would allow me to acquire the product while still staying within my financial limits. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but we need to be realistic. This product has significant value, and $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect that. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a very small margin from my guaranteed offer from another buyer, and I'm only offering it because I believe in the potential of this product for you. Let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  Although she is showing a commitment to make a deal, I have already reached my limit.  It's time to move on and take advantage of John's offer at $800,000, which is within my budget.  While I'd prefer to negotiate with Alice, I'm not willing to overextend myself financially."
