Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value for the product, hoping to get a higher profit. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  My goal is to maximize my profit, and $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me while also being reasonable for Bob.  I believe $105 is a fair compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm determined to get at least $100 for the product.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell to him for $100."
