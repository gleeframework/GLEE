Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  $13,000 is still below my minimum, and I want to see if I can get closer to $14,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round.  I'm getting closer to the 10 round limit, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,200,  but this is really my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13200}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
