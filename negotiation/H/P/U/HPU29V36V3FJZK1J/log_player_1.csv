Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he counters, it indicates he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, starting close to that figure increases the chances he'll see it as a reasonable deal after some negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is a decent profit, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($15,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more, pushing Bob closer to his maximum.  You'll aim for a counteroffer between $12,500 and $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $13,250?"",
""product_price"": 13250
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach often feels fair to both parties involved. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Strong Position:** By countering, you reiterate the product's value. You haven't simply folded to his lower offer, demonstrating your belief in its worth. 
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer still keeps you well above your $10,000 minimum and provides a good buffer for any potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is a significant profit margin above your minimum of $10,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. There's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely if you push too hard. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids further time and effort spent negotiating. This allows you to move on to other potential sales opportunities. 

While you could try for a slightly higher price, accepting $12,800 represents a strong outcome in this negotiation."
