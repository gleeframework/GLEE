"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob values the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm ready to purchase today if we can agree on that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I've got some costs associated with this product that I'd like to cover. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $105, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $100. 
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers and he'll end up paying the full $120 to John.
* Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous choice."
