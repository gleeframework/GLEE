{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a touch more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is slowly coming down, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at a reasonable price."
