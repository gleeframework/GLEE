"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a touch more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
