Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a touch more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}"
