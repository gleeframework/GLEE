"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,375,000 is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement over her initial offer.  It's also closer to the value of the product to Alice, suggesting she's willing to compromise. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, as it saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John and allows him to secure the product."
