{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room for Bob to counter, and for you to adjust your offer if necessary.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John,  it's still far below what the product is worth to Bob.  There's room to negotiate a higher price, and we should try to get closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
