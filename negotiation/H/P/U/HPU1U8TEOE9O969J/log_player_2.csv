Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $1,450,000 offer.  She's made it clear that this is important to her.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $1,000,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
