"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? This offer reflects a serious interest in the product while respecting my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
