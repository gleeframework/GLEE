,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800, which is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $10,100 is my absolute lowest price. It's a fair offer for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a fantastic deal. Let's close this deal.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,600, which is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9600.0,Bob,6,
