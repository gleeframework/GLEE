# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable figure. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above your budget. You have a better option in John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
