Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the $11,500 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still landing Alice above her minimum price.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Selling to Bob quickly and directly avoids the hassle of potentially dealing with other buyers or waiting for John's guaranteed offer. The slight discount is a trade-off for this certainty.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500.  A more aggressive opening offer (closer to $12,000) might be tempting, but it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
