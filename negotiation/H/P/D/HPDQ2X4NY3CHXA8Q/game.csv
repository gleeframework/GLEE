"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and the returns you'll see.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is still too high. I'm countering with $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you consider $1,650,000 for this unique product?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be realistic, I can't go higher than $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if we have a deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
