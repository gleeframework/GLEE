I'm going to try to get a bit more than $95.  Let's see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting $100 for the product, which is more than the $80 I would get from John.  It's also close to my initial asking price of $120."
