"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and there are multiple rounds left. Bob has plenty of time to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $900,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and gives Alice a good incentive to negotiate. It's still within Bob's budget and allows for some wiggle room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He's aiming for a price closer to $900,000, so he should reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still several rounds left, and he can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation, as Bob still has a significant buffer before reaching his limit. This counteroffer balances the need to get a good deal with the urgency of closing the deal before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to Bob's desired price range. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise further.  

Additionally, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price increases. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget."
