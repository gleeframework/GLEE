,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on a fantastic product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $125 is still slightly below my ideal price, I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. To be honest, I'm starting to think this deal might not be worth my time. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $129. This is my absolute lowest price.  It's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",129.0,Alice,7,
