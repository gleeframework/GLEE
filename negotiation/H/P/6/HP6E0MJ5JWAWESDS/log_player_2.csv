"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget.  You're aiming for $80 or less, so it makes sense to reject and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to your budget, you're still aiming for $80 or less. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer at $90.  While this is closer to your budget, you are still determined to get it for $80 or less.  Since John is willing to sell for $80, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
