"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my assessment, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  I'm confident in the product's true worth, and $850,000 falls significantly short of that.  Would you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that accounts for both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,000,000 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate. You can try a counteroffer closer to your maximum price point and see if you can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's true value.  Would you be open to considering a final offer of $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that bridges the gap between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your $800,000 limit.  At this point, it's likely that the negotiation will continue to be back and forth, and it's uncertain if you can get the price down further. Given that John is selling the product for your desired price, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
