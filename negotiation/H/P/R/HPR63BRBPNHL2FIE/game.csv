"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my assessment, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  I'm confident in the product's true worth, and $850,000 falls significantly short of that.  Would you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that accounts for both our positions.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's true value.  Would you be open to considering a final offer of $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that bridges the gap between our valuations.",975000.0,Alice,5,
