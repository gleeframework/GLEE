"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. At $850,000, Bob is saving $650,000 compared to buying from John. While there's still room for negotiation, the potential gain from further bargaining is not significant enough to risk losing the deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice in this scenario."
