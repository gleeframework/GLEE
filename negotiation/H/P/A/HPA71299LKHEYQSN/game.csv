"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  Would you consider $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I value your interest and willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and call it $1,287,500?  This would represent a significant movement on my part.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
