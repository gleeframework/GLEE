"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $10,000.
* **Alice's offer is better than John's price:**  It's $1,000 cheaper than buying from John.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's unclear if Alice will budge further. There's a risk of getting stuck in a loop and ending up paying more than $9,000.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision at this point, securing the product within Bob's budget and saving money compared to John's offer."
