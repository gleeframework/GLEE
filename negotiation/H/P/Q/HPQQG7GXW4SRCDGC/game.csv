"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750? It's a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,250 as a compromise. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to recoup my costs.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $7,900?  That's a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",7900.0,Bob,6,
