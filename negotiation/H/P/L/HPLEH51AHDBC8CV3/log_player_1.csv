"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than the product's value to me, hoping to leverage the fact that it's worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and confident, hoping to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, which could incentivize him to consider my offer. 

This is just my initial offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I need to hold out for a better price.  

* **I'm confident I can get a better deal:** Bob acknowledged the product's value, meaning he's motivated to buy. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't reach an agreement. 

I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $700,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get the fair price I'm looking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $1,000,000:**  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. It shows willingness to compromise but also leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Focus on value and fairness:**  I reiterate the product's value and highlight that this offer is fair for both of us.
* **Positive framing:** I end with a question, inviting Bob to continue the conversation. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a little rich for my blood.  How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While it's closer to my previous counteroffer, I'm not willing to accept a deal that significantly undercuts the product's worth to me. 

* **I'm not desperate:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000, so I can afford to be patient.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I believe a mutually beneficial price is still possible. 

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant investment for you but still a fair price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Highlighting the value again:** I reiterate the product's value, emphasizing that $850,000 is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us, creating a positive and collaborative atmosphere.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
