Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $700,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get the fair price I'm looking for. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a little rich for my blood.  How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant investment for you but still a fair price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 than risk Alice not budging any further."
