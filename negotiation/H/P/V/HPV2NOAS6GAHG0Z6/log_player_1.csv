Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1800000. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I will accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,600,000,  $1,520,000 is a good price and I'm happy with the deal. It's better than selling to John and leaves me with more money."
