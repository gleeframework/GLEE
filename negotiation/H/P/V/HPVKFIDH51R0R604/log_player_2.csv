"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1500000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no immediate advantage to accepting. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  If you fail, you can always buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer.  The product seems promising, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1200000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1350000.  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, which is a decent discount. This is within my budget, and it's a good compromise. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price that saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk of negotiating further, but it's not worth the potential of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy at the higher price from John."
