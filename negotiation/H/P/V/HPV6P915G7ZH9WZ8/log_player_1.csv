Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to negotiate up to this price.
* **It's lower than my minimum value:** I won't accept anything less than $12,000, so I have room to negotiate if needed.

This offer allows for potential negotiation, and if Bob rejects it, I can gauge his interest level based on his counteroffer. If he doesn't come close to my minimum, I can switch to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While it's higher than his initial perceived value, it's still not a good deal for me.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.

I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value. There's still a chance Bob might negotiate further, and I'll be able to gauge his true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  Shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.
* **Closer to my minimum:** It's only $500 below my minimum, giving me some room for negotiation.

This counteroffer is meant to be a middle ground. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still $3,000 less than what I'd get from John.  

I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my value or if he's just playing games.  If he rejects my next offer, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  Shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.
* **Significantly closer to my minimum:** It's only $1,000 below my minimum, giving me very little room for negotiation.

This counteroffer is meant to be my final stand. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me at this price. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John without hesitation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000, even after several rounds of negotiation. It's clear that he's not willing to meet me closer to my desired price. 

Rather than continue negotiating with Bob and risk losing even more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum value, and it's the best option for me at this point."
