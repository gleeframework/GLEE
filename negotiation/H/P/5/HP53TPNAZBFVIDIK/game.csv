"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you showing me the product. While it does look interesting,  $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $14000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $16000. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
