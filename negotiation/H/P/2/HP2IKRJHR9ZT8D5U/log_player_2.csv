# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can still make a profit:**  Even though Alice's offer is above her own valuation of $1,200,000, you are still getting a good deal as it's below your own valuation of $1,500,000."
