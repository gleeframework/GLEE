"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer before I look at other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,750. This is my best price for the product. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. ",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,700. This is my last offer. What do you think?",9700.0,Alice,7,
