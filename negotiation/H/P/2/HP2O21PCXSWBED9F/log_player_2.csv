"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, ideally under $8,000. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob needs to make a significant counteroffer to show he's serious about getting a good deal. $8,500 is a big jump down from $12,000 and is still within his $8,000 limit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob is not offering his absolute bottom price, leaving space for bargaining in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, $10,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. It's worth rejecting and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer before I look at other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Final Offer:** By calling it his ""final offer"", Bob is adding pressure on Alice. He's also subtly reminding her of the alternative (buying from John).
* **Strategic Value:** This offer leaves a bit of room for Alice to counter without dropping below Bob's maximum limit of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,750. This is my best price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not There Yet:**  $9,750 is closer to Bob's target, but it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He's not going to lose out on a good deal by accepting too quickly.
* **Potential for Further Reduction:** Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower to close the deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice.  She knows he has a backup option (John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is moving closer to Alice's price but not giving in entirely. This shows he's serious about closing the deal but still wants a good price.
* **Finality:** By again calling it a ""final offer,"" Bob is putting the ball in Alice's court. She has to decide if she wants to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Close to the Limit:**  This offer keeps the negotiation within Bob's acceptable range, allowing him to still get a good deal without going over his $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,700. This is my last offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Worth the Risk:**  $9,700 is very close to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above his limit. He's been negotiating for a while and is starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. 
* **John's Offer is More Appealing:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is a sure thing. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of a stalemate or her refusing to go lower, potentially leaving Bob with no product.
* **Time is Money:** Bob has already invested several rounds into this negotiation.  Buying from John is the safer, quicker option that allows him to stay within his budget and get the product."
