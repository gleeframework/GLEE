"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal today.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with the final price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
