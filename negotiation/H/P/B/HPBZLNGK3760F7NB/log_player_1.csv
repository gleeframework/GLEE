"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal today."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to sell below $1,300,000 at this point. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with the final price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure if Bob is willing to budge much further. While his offer is tempting, I'd prefer to avoid the risk of continued negotiation that could result in a lower price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000. It's time to move on and sell to John."
