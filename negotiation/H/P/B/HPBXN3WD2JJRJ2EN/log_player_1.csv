I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than what I think the product is worth."

Ok, I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is better than selling to John, and I'm starting to think Bob might be firm on his price."
