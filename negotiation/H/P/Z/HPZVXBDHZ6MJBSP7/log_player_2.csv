``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $14,500 is better than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13750?  It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.
