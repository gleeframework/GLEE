"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects its significant value and offers a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for you to get a significant value from this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950,000. This is still a significant discount from your original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. How about $975,000? This is a good price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'd like to propose a revised offer of $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this sale and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,7,
