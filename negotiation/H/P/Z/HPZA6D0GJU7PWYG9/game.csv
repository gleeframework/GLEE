"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8200 is simply too low for me.  My product is unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500. That's the highest I can go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  Considering the value of this product and the fact that I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $10000, I'm willing to come down to $8800. This would be a great deal for you, and we can both walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8400. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",8400.0,Bob,6,
