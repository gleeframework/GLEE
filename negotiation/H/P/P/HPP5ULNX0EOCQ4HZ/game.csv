,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll go $90. That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this.",90.0,Bob,4,
