"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $1075000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and a decent compromise. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John (who will sell for $1,000,000) outweighs the potential savings. It's a good deal, and you're better off securing the product now."
