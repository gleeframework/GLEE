"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my absolute top limit for this product is $1,400,000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to be transparent about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1,500,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
