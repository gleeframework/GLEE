Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower price to establish a bargaining range and signal your commitment to a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's last offer, showing my strong commitment to a price closer to my budget. $900,000 is still a good value for Alice, considering her initial valuation of $1,000,000. I hope this move will encourage her to compromise and bring us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous price, it is still above my budget. I want to try to push for a lower price and will counter with a lower price in the next round. I'm also getting closer to my maximum allowed rounds, so I need to ensure I get a good deal in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $925,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to close the gap.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still acknowledges the value she's placing on the product.  It's also within my budget and offers a good compromise, potentially pushing her to accept the deal.  With only four rounds left, the pressure is on to reach a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you're working with a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer $910,000 as a final compromise.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step towards Alice's last offer, but still within my budget. With only two rounds remaining, it's time to be bold and try to close the deal at a price closer to my target. I'm hoping this final push will convince Alice to accept, as she's likely getting closer to her bottom line as well."
