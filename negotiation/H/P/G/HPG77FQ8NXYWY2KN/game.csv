"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $925,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's close this out.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you're working with a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer $910,000 as a final compromise.  Let's make this happen.",910000.0,Bob,8,
