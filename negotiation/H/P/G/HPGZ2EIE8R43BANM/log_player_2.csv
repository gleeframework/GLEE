"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $110 is too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground.  It's significantly lower than Alice's starting price, showing you're serious about a deal, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $100 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving $20 from your maximum budget, and it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price."
