"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction quickly.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
