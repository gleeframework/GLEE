# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? I believe that's a fair price considering the features and benefits you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
