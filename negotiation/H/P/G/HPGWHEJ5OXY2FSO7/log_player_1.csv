"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a slightly higher price than the product's worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I am only able to offer $750000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than our desired price, it's still within the realm of negotiation. We aim for a higher price and have rounds to work with.  Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a substantial profit. We've moved closer to Bob's offer but still maintain a significant margin. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with $775000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has stated this is his final offer, we've already moved closer to his price and still have rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows us to try and inch closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $775,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is crucial. We are now offering the product at the price John would pay. This puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal to John. We are hoping that Bob will accept, as he knows that this is a fair price for him and the best he's likely to get."
