Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant returns on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and potential for ""significant returns"" to justify the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he's very interested but finds $1,500,000 too steep. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, setting the initial price too high might discourage Bob from negotiating at all.  You'll need to gauge Bob's personality and risk tolerance."
