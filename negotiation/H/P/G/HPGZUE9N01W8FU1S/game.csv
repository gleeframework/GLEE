"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
