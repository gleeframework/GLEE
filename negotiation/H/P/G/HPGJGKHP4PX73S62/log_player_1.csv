"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer is the most reasonable option to secure the deal and avoid potential losses by selling to John. While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly better offer in the future."
