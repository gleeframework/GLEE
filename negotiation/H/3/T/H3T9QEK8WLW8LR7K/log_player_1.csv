Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know if this works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $11,500 is closer, but I'm really aiming for something under $10,000. How about $10,250? That's a significant step towards your price, and it would allow me to make this purchase.
