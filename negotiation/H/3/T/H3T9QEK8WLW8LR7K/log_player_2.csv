Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so let's meet at $11,750. It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price above my maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go below $11,000 at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000."
