"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially make a deal at $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $700,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm ready to make this work.  How about we settle at $950,000?  This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise.  I do feel like we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I can offer you $750,000.  This represents a significant investment from my end, but I believe the product is worth it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,6,
