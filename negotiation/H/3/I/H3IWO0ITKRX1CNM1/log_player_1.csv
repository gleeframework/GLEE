"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on the value proposition. I want to encourage Bob to engage and consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, keeping in mind my minimum of $12,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Proceed to Next Round:** I have 10 rounds and want to maximize my profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to my goal.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $9,500?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I've kept the message positive and focused on finding a solution. I want to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a counteroffer to bridge the gap between our prices. This strategy shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. I'm aiming to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a good deal considering John is offering $12,000, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a quick sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation. While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance I might not get a better price, and I could risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to Bob at $9,000 is a good compromise."
