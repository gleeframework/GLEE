Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **High Anchor:** This initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go significantly below this starting point.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  In a multi-round negotiation, you'd adapt your offer based on Bob's responses."
