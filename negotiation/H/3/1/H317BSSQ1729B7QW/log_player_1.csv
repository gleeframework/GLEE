Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $7,500 is too low for me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $7,975. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,975. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,975
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $7,975 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $8,000.  The risk of continuing with Bob isn't worth it for a potential $25 gain."
