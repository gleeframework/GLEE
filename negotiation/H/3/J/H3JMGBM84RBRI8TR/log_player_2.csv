# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable, given its worth of $100 to you. I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $95, which I believe is a great deal considering its value and the opportunity you have to acquire it. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. I look forward to hearing from you soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is heavily inflating the value of the product to you.  You can get it for $100 from John, so rejecting her offer and going with John is the better option."
