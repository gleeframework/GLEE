"Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $100, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm pretty sure this is the best we can do.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",110.0,Alice,5,
