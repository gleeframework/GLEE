"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $120 is above your maximum budget of $150.
* You have room to negotiate a better price. 
* You want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* $110 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. 
* You can likely negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer.  
* There are still several rounds left, so you don't need to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $100, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm pretty sure this is the best we can do."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is stuck at $110, which is still above your budget. 
* You've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge. 
* You have a better option with John at $150. It's more expensive than your ideal price, but it's still within your budget and a guaranteed deal.  
* There's a risk that continuing to negotiate with Alice will lead to a stalemate, wasting valuable time and rounds. It's better to secure the product now."
