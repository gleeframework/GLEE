"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic offer! Getting the product for $200,000 less than your maximum budget and Alice's valuation is a steal. There's no guarantee you could negotiate a better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
