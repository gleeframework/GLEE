{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the potential value to Bob, making it more enticing.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $925,000 is a reasonable compromise and gets me closer to my minimum desired price.  There's a chance I could get a bit more if I keep negotiating, but the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $1,200,000 is too high at this point. Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision."
