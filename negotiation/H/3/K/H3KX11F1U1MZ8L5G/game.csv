"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further back-and-forth.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a sense that we might be too far apart.  I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm confident this product will be valuable to you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm also open to exploring other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
