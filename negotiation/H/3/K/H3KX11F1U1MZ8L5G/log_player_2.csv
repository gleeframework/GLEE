"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. Since Bob's maximum price is $10,000, he has room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price.  He can continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further back-and-forth."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting a sense that we might be too far apart.  I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm confident this product will be valuable to you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm also open to exploring other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that she's not willing to go lower than $11,000, and Bob's maximum price is $10,000. There's no chance of reaching an agreement within Bob's budget. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at the $10,000 price point and avoid further negotiation."
