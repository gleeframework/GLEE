"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm keen on the product but $2,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could work with $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value this brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,800,000 is closer, my budget is pushing me more towards $1,400,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement on this.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'd need to see it a bit higher for it to work on my end.  How about we land at $1,650,000? This feels like a strong point for both of us, wouldn't you agree?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I appreciate the movement we've made.  To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  I'm hoping you can see the value in closing this deal now.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
