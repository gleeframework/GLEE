Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm keen on the product but $2,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that steep of a discount.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could work with $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value this brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,800,000 is closer, my budget is pushing me more towards $1,400,000. Would that be something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement on this.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'd need to see it a bit higher for it to work on my end.  How about we land at $1,650,000? This feels like a strong point for both of us, wouldn't you agree?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I appreciate the movement we've made.  To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  I'm hoping you can see the value in closing this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob has reached my absolute minimum price. While there might be a slim chance of getting a slightly higher amount in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. It's time to close the deal."
