# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is already below your maximum price, it's worth trying to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product while saving $200,000 compared to buying from John."
