"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
