"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That feels fair to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",11250.0,Alice,5,
