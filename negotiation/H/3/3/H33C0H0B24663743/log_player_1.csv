Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $120 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further and potentially get closer to your ideal price."
