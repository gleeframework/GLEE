**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, we're still significantly below the $1,000,000 mark.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering, especially with the time constraint of the remaining rounds. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the most strategically sound decision at this point."
