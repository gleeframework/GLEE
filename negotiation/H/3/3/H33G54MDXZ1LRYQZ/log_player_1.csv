Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still yields a $200,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further risks losing the deal with Bob, especially if he's getting close to his maximum budget.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate delays the opportunity to re-invest the earnings or utilize the product elsewhere.

Accepting $1,400,000 ensures a good profit while minimizing risk and delay."
