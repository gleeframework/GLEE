"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16,000. How about we meet at $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're coming up in your offer, but $13,500 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $15,000 as a final offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've gone up quite a bit already, and I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for the product",14000.0,Bob,6,
