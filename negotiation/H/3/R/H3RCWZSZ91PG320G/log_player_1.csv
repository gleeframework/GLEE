Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you think Bob will find the product valuable, you're subtly justifying the price without explicitly stating it's worth more than $80. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?""  invites Bob to respond and potentially negotiate the price, giving you more information to work with.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
