"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good price.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to take a lower price than my ideal, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a decent price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can push for a little more.  We're getting to the end of the negotiation, so I want to make sure I'm getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a slightly lower offer than my last one, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount.  With only a few rounds left, I need to see if Bob will budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $1,275,000 is a good deal and we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  It's important to keep in mind that selling to John would only get me $1,000,000, and I think we're close to closing this deal."
