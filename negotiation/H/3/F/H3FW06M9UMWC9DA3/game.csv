"Alice,  your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $800,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential are significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer, and to make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between its true value and your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I value the product, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest, and we can both walk away with a positive outcome.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
