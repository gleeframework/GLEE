"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to meet you halfway. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1250000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1150000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's agree on $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
