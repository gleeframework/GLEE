Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1150000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's agree on $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my maximum budget. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept and secure the product at my target price."
