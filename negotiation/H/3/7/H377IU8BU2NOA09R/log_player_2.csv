"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is far more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should reject this offer and try to get a price closer to his maximum."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:**  This gets him the product but at a price ($10,000) that is higher than his maximum ($8,000) and closer to what he's willing to pay from John.
2. **Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer:**  There is a high chance Alice will reject another counteroffer, and the negotiations might go on for a while. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at a lower price, it makes sense to **buy the product from John for $8,000**. This saves him money and avoids further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
