"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
