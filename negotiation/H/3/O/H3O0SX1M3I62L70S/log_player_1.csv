Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe will be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us a strong negotiating position.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. A price close to his valuation ($1,300,000) leaves him with a perceived gain ($200,000) making him more likely to accept.
* **John as Backup:** We have a safety net with John ($800,000), but aiming higher with Bob is strategically advantageous. 

**Note:** This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with deal closure. There's a chance Bob might negotiate for a lower price."
