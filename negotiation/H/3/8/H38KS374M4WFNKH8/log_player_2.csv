"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

You have a clear goal of paying no more than $1,200,000. Alice's offer is above that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target. You can still buy from John for $1,200,000 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,315,000. This is a very close to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You've tried to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $115,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
