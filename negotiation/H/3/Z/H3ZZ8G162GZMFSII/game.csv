"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's discuss this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway and agree on a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise, don't you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up slightly from my previous offer, and I believe $1,150,000 reflects a fair price that accounts for both our needs. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your commitment to closing this deal, and I appreciate the continued negotiation.  However, $1,250,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
