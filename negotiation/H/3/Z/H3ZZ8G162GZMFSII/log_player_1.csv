Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up slightly from my previous offer, and I believe $1,150,000 reflects a fair price that accounts for both our needs. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.
