Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but I can't quite go down to $8,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.
