Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but I can't quite go down to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you holding firm on your valuation.  Let's try this - $9,500.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still reflecting a fair deal for me.  What do you think?
