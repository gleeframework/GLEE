"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I can see that's not feasible for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my limits.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1100000, which would be $1050000. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
