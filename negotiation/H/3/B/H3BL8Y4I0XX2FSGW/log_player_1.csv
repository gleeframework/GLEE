"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4

We're still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate upwards, so we'll hold firm for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $825,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob is getting very close to our fallback option, and we're into the second half of the negotiation rounds.  Taking the $825,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
