"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but makes it clear that $200 is unacceptable. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While $60 is quite low, it puts the pressure on Alice and gives us room to move up in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $170 is still way above your budget and even above Alice's value. Continuing the negotiation is worthwhile, but it's important to show you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice, but $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $70?  I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:**  We're moving up from $60, showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  The offer of $70 keeps us under our maximum budget of $80.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By making a reasonable offer and stating it's fair, we subtly signal that we might go with John if Alice doesn't budge enough."
