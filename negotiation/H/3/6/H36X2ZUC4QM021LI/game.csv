"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, as I think it's a fair price considering its value. I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to offer $100 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $105 for this product. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love, and I think it's worth the investment. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",105.0,Alice,5,
