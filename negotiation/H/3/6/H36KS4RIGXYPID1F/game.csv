,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This product is truly valuable, and I want you to have it at a fair price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
