"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $160 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",145.0,Alice,5,
