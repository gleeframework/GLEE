"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to us, but considering its importance to you, we believe it's only fair to share the benefits. We're offering this exceptional product to you for $10,000. We understand its worth to you is $12,000, and we aim to be both fair and reasonable in our pricing. We hope you'll see the value in our offer and consider making it yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her. Alice might be willing to come down closer to her $8,000 valuation to avoid losing the sale."
