{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. While I have other interested parties, I believe you'd greatly benefit from its unique value proposition. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. "",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if necessary) while still aiming high.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Highlighting other interested parties (John) subtly creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Limited-Time Offer:** This encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and not let the opportunity slip away."
