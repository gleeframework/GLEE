Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. How about $115?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my lower limit, I'm still not comfortable selling for $115. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach an agreement."

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to feel like we're going back and forth without getting anywhere. I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale and a much better price than what Bob is offering."
