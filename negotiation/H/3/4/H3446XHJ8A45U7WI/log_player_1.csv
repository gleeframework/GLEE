"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves some room for negotiation. I know the product is worth $12,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a profit, but I also want to leave room for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'll reject it and see if we can reach a better agreement. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm willing to drop the price a little more, but I need to stay above my minimum. This is likely my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
