Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $115 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($20) between your minimum and Bob's valuation. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale above your minimum."
