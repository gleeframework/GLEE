"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your budget. It's best to reject and counter-offer with a lower price to see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Beginning with a significantly lower offer ($60) allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $75 is closer to your budget, there's still a chance to negotiate a better price.  
* **Time Advantage:** You have several rounds left, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $67?"",
 ""product_price"": 67
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to move closer to her price but still want a significant discount.
* **Middle Ground:** Suggesting a middle ground aims for a fair compromise. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is clear, concise, and continues a polite and respectful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see that we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original price. How about we try $72? It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Alice is making very small concessions ($3 this round). This indicates there might be room for further negotiation. 
* **Alternative Exists:** You're still not far off from John's price. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, it might be worth buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I respect that.  Would you consider $69?  That's a serious offer, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 69
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** The message strikes a balance between firmness (stating it's a serious offer) and acknowledging Alice's position.
* **Small Increment:** A $3 increase from your previous offer shows willingness to move closer, but not too quickly.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, it's time to nudge Alice towards a decision while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we try $70? It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $70 is only $10 less than John's offer.  The potential savings of another round or two of negotiation are unlikely to be significant.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming firmer on her price or you running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $80.
* **Fair Deal:**  Alice has also made compromises, and $70 represents a reasonably fair compromise for both parties."
