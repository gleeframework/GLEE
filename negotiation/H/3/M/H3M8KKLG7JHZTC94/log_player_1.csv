"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
*  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit. 
* This price is also within the ""sweet spot"" of Bob's value, making a deal likely. 
* I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price and Bob's perceived value. 
* **I have room to negotiate.**  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiations. 
* **Selling to John is not the optimal choice.** While it guarantees a sale, it's a lower price than I can potentially achieve with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's offer and shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still profitable:**  This price is still significantly higher than my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Keeping pressure on:** By not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm signaling that I'm confident in the value of my product and not desperate for a quick sale."

* **Time is on my side.** With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is a further concession, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By making a smaller concession, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept the offer or risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.**  While I would prefer a higher price, this offer is within the range where I can still make a reasonable profit.
* **Time is running out.** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. 
* **Selling to John is not preferable.**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a better price than selling to John. 

I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
