**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John for $8,000 is the most financially advantageous choice."
