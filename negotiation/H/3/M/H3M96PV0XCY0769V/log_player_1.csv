Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to sell to John.  The negotiations with Bob have been dragging on, and I'm not confident I'll be able to reach a price that satisfies both of us in the remaining rounds.  John's offer of $10,000 is my minimum, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
