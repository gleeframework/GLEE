"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $900,000, which leaves room for negotiation. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** A $150,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is significant, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Within Budget:** This offer remains within your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter without going below her desired price point of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down, her offer is still above my budget. I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's value in seeing if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This clearly signals to Alice that this is your final offer and you're serious about it.
* **Meeting Budget:** This offer is your absolute limit and ensures you don't overspend.
* **Pressure Point:** This offer puts the pressure on Alice to decide - accept and finalize the deal or risk losing the sale."
