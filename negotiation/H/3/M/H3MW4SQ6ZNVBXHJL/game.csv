"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
