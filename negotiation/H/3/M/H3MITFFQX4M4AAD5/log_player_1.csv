"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what Bob is willing to pay, but still above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer and closer to what I think the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135. However, I'm still only able to offer $132. It's a fair price, and I'm really interested in the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I still think I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $133 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 133}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $133. It's a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm also trying to meet Bob halfway and see if he'll bite."
