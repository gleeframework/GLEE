Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but going lower ensures a higher chance of Bob accepting.
* **Beat Bob's Value:** Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) creates a potential ""deal"" scenario in his mind.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and not overthink the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the need to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
