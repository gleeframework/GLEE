"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,800 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,400?",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,400. I can offer it to you for $8,600. It's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
