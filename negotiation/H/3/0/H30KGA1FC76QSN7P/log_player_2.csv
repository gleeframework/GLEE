"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,800 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,400?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,400. I can offer it to you for $8,600. It's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $8,600 is very close to Bob's target of $8,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** There are only five rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While Bob could potentially get a slightly better price, there's a risk of losing this deal entirely. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the opportunity."
