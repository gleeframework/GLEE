"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?  This price still leaves me some room, and I think it's fair for you too."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'm still a bit away. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the previous offer, so how about $11,125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is clearly not going to budge much further, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer, I'll risk losing him entirely.  $11,125 is a decent price, and I don't want to take the chance of ending up with nothing."
