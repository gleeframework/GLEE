"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000,  which is a significant compromise.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
