This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's a good starting point, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and try to meet in the middle."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is insistent on his price, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. While I would prefer to make a profit, I'm comfortable selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
