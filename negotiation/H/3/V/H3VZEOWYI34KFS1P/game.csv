"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a significant profit while still staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still allow you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
