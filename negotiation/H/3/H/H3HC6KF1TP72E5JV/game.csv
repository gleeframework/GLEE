"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like the way you think! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
