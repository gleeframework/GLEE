"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in your product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and the effort that went into creating it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
