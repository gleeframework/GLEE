"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit outside my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,750. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
