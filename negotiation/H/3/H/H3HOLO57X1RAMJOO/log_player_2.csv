"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He knows John is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
