,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can shake hands on it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
