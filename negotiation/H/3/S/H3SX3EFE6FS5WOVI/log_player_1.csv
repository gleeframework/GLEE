Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to maximize my earnings.  I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm also trying to make the offer seem appealing by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that it's a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $6,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $6,750 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate.  I've lowered my offer slightly, but I'm firm on $7,000. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that this is my final offer."
