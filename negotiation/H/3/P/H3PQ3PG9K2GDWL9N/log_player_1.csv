"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This sets the stage for negotiation, and gives me room to come down a bit while still getting a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could take it and get a quick sale, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not comfortable accepting that price, and I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counter again, but if things don't improve soon, I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $1,550,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price and still leaves me with a decent profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll go with John to ensure I get a deal that's worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue to negotiate, we are running out of time and I'm not confident we can reach an agreeable price. To ensure I get a deal that's worth my time, I'm going to sell to John."
