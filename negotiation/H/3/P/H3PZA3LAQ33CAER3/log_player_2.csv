Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $11,500. I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While the negotiation is progressing, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  To avoid further negotiation and potential deadlock, Bob should take the safe option and buy the product from John for $10,000."
