"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit tight on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. How about we meet at $980000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $980000. How about we try $920000? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $920000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $960000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum price than $920000.",960000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $960000. How about we try $930000? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to where I'm comfortable.",930000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $980000? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",980000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really struggling to go above $930000. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",950000.0,Bob,10,
