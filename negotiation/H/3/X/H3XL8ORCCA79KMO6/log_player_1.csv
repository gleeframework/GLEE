Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it as ""excellent value"" aims to create a perception of high quality and potentially sway his decision.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $80, which acts as your safety net. 
 
This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay while leaving room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own perceived value of the product ($80). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. 

It's clear that there's a wide gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about negotiating a fairer price while still leaving room for a potential deal. You can now propose a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $60 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $100. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By coming down from $120 to $100, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle. 
* **Framing:**  Highlighting the $100 price as a ""fair compromise"" attempts to make it more appealing and suggests a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is still comfortably above your minimum ($80) and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back,  while also moving closer to a price Bob might realistically accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $70. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $70 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below the $80 you can get from John with no further negotiation. There's no reason to accept a lower price from Bob when you have a guaranteed buyer at $80. 

You'll reject this offer to signal you're firm on a price closer to your minimum, but you're also very close to accepting John's offer. This might prompt Bob to make a more reasonable offer or it might be time to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer for $80. I'm willing to let it go to you for $75 as a final offer, but I can't go any lower."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Finality:** By revealing John's offer, you create a sense of urgency and transparency. This shows Bob that your offer is serious and time-sensitive. 
* **Slight Concession with a Firm Boundary:** Offering $75 is a small concession from your previous counteroffer, but it's still above your minimum and presents a final opportunity for Bob.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob without missing out on the guaranteed sale to John. 
 
This approach aims to either secure a slightly better deal than John's offer or prompt a quick decision from Bob, allowing you to maximize your profit."
