"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250, which would be $7,875. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,875 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
