"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to you. I'm sure you've researched its value, and I believe it's a fantastic investment. My asking price is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and still provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a solution that works.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
