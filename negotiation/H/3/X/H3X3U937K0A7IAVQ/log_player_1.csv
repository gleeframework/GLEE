"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This approach allows for some back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Offering a good deal:** While $11,500 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a significant discount from my minimum threshold. 
* **Staying open to John's offer:** I'm willing to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum, so I'm not afraid to use John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. There's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John gives me leverage during the negotiation.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive and constructive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm open to further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is crucial:**  While I'm running out of time, I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I'm still comfortable with selling to John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $11,250. It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:** I'm raising the price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a better price without losing Bob completely.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise, not a hard stance. This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to continue talking.
* **Building urgency:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation by suggesting that we need to ""make this work.""
* **Staying open to negotiation:** I'm not closing the door on further negotiations, but I'm also showing that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Time is running out:** While I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't reach a better agreement with Bob, I have a guaranteed $12,000 waiting with John.

I'll try one more time to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm ready to walk away if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $10,900 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. How about $11,100?  It's a small step from where we are now, and it's the best I can do.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with my other offer."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer. The pressure of a limited timeframe is on Bob now.
* **Small step:**  I'm moving up by only $200, showing that I'm being reasonable but firm.
* **Alternative offer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have a backup option, making my position stronger.
* **Urgency:** The ""final concession"" and ""have to go with my other offer"" phrases create a sense of urgency. 

This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my desired amount.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm afraid $11,100 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, just like I said before. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to the final rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob has clearly stated his limit, and it's unlikely he'll budge any further.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Given the limited time and the fact that Bob's offer is unacceptable, selling to John for $12,000 is the best course of action. It guarantees me a profit above my minimum and ensures a quick sale.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a good price and avoid risking further losses in the negotiation."
