{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $1,100,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. Bob is moving closer to our range, so we'll continue negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is making slow progress. We're still significantly closer to John's offer than Bob's willingness to pay. By continuing to reject and counter, we signal the value of the product and encourage Bob to move closer to our acceptable range."
