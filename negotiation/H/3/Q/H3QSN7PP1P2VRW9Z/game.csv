"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,200,000 is not feasible. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're willing to make a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, which would be $800,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",800000.0,Alice,5,
