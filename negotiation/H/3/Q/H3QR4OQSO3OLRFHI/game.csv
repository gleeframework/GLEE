"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
