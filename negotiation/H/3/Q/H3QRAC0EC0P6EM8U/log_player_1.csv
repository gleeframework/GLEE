Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find common ground."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I still believe there's a chance to close the deal with Bob for a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer to see if we can find a compromise."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing as quickly as I hoped, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at this point rather than risk losing both Bob and John."
