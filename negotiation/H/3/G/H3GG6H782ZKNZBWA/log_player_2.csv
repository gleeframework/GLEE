# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $19,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."
