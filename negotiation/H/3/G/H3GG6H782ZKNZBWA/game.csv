"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer.",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $19,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to go to $14,000, which is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
