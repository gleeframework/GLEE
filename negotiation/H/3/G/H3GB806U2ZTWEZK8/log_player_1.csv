{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  It leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price allows for back and forth while still potentially achieving a good outcome for you. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible while keeping your goal in mind!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $13,000. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely do better. You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $12,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a good price and me to get a fair deal. Let's try to find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and come down from your initial price.
* **Not settling:** It's still above Bob's offer, giving you room to potentially get a better deal. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully, and while I understand your perspective, I'm still unable to meet the price of $12,500. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to try for another counteroffer, Bob's last offer of $12,000 is a good deal.  Here's why:

* **Close to your goal:** It's significantly higher than your minimum of $10,000, which is the price John would offer.
* **No guarantee of a higher price:**  There's no guarantee that Bob would accept a higher counteroffer, and you could risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, securing a good price while minimizing risk."
