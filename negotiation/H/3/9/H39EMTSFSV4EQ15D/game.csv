"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know holds significant value for your business. While it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I'm sure you'll find very attractive. Please consider my offer of $1,400,000.  This is a substantial saving for you, and it ensures a profitable transaction for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
