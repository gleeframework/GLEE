"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about meeting in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while respecting your budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
