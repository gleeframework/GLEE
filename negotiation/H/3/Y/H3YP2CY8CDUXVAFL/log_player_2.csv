"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That's a fair price that would allow us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
