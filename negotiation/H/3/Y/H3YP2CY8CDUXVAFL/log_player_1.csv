"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than nothing, I'm still closer to my target of $15,000 and I have more negotiation rounds left. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000?  That's a fair price that would allow us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired $15,000, we're already at round 4 and the negotiation process can be unpredictable. It's better to secure a deal now, especially considering the value of the product to Bob and the risk of further rejection or a stalled negotiation."
