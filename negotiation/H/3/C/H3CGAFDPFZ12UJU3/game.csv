"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for something worth at least $10000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product,  $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $9000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750. It's a good compromise, and we can both close this deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8875?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $8875 is still a bit out of my price range. I can go up to $8250, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Bob,6,
