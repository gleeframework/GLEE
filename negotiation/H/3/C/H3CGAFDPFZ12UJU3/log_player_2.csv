"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for something worth at least $10000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to pay up to $8,000. Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product,  $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible and wants to stay below his $8,000 limit.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still too high.  Rejecting again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. It's a good compromise, and we can both close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8875?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $8875 is still a bit out of my price range. I can go up to $8,250, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
