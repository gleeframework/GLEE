"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $10,000 to you. Considering its quality and the unique features it offers, I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for this exceptional item. This offer allows you to acquire it at a slight premium over its cost to me, while still saving you $500 compared to its market value. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,
