"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $110.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point,  splitting the difference between Alice's offer of $110 and Bob's maximum price of $120. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not a good deal compared to buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to his $105 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already tried a lower price and Alice rejected it.  At this point, it's a good strategy to meet Alice halfway, offering the middle ground between his previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $112, which is only $2 more than Bob's previous counteroffer of $110.  It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small reduction in price.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $120, accepting Alice's offer saves $8 and is the most cost-effective choice at this point."
