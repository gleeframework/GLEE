"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $775,000 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiation. Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
