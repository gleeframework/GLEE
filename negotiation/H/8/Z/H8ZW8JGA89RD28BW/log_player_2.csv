# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth less to me than to her, so I'll start by offering half of what she initially asked for.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'll try to meet her halfway, but still keep the price reasonable for me.

{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
