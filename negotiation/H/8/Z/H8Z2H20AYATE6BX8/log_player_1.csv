Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering the product at $10,000 allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, I make a significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency. Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. I can always lower the price closer to $8,000, knowing I have John as a backup."
