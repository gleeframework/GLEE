"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob needs to start the negotiation process. Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point that's still within his budget.
* **Motivating Alice:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his price limit. It might encourage Alice to consider a compromise. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still some room for negotiation; Bob might be willing to go slightly higher if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $132.50.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $132.50 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's still a chance to get the price down further.
* **Safe Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, he can still buy the product from John for $120. This provides a safety net and allows him to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget at $132.50. How about $128? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is proposing a price that is closer to Alice's offer but still within his comfort zone.  
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is flexible and willing to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While the offer is closer to Alice's, it still leaves room for negotiation if needed. Bob wants to keep the pressure on to secure the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $130.  I think this is a good compromise, and it gives us both a win.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $130 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Alice is consistently lowering her price, indicating that she's likely willing to go even lower. 
* **Safe Option:**  Bob can still buy the product from John for $120, giving him a secure backup option while continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $126?  That's a reasonable compromise, and we can both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 126} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  Bob is offering a price that is closer to his budget limit but still a slight compromise from his previous offer.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  He is emphasizing that this is a ""reasonable compromise"" to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By suggesting a slightly lower price, Bob is keeping the pressure on Alice to reach a deal."
