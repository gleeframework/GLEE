I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a decent margin above my minimum value, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I want to maximize my profits, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still attempting to secure a higher price.  I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure the deal than risk further negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing."
