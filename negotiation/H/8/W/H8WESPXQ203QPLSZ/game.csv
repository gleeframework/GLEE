"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is still a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given your earlier willingness to negotiate, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting at least $912,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, and I see that we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. To ensure a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm willing to offer a final price of $890,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,7,
