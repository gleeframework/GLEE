Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, but I need you to understand that this is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What's your decision?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling a hard limit:** Her language (""final concession,"" ""consider other options"") suggests she won't budge much further.
* **The price is getting close to your walk-away point:** Continuing to push risks either a stalemate or a deal slightly better than John's offer, not worth the risk.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've used more than half the rounds.  While you could get a slightly better deal, the potential savings are shrinking each round. 

While not ideal, $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise to secure the product now."
