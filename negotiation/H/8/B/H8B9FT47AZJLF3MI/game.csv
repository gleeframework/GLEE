"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $137.50, which is closer to my budget. Let's make this happen!",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $137.50 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $140? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $138.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",138.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $138.50 is getting close to your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $139? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",139.0,Alice,7,
