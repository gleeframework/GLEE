"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  While Bob wants to acquire the product, he can secure it for significantly less from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to counteroffer at a lower price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going to offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the same price he would pay John. This is a strong opening counteroffer, leaving little room for further negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about acquiring the product but is also firm in his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it is a step closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his budget. It's best to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate, but is still staying below his maximum budget. This counteroffer aims to find a price point that is more appealing to Alice while remaining within Bob's financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob has already stated his firm upper limit of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice offers the possibility of reaching a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```
