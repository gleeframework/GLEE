"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. To start negotiations, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is set higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest and flexibility. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  While we have a guaranteed offer from John, we aim to maximize profit. This offer leaves a margin to negotiate but still surpasses John's price.

This first offer sets the stage for negotiation and allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his counter-offer shows some willingness to negotiate, we're still far apart.  We'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but my initial assessment of the product's value remains firm. To move this forward, I can adjust my price to $1,600,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, highlighting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We've lowered the price by $150,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, the new offer is still above both Bob's perceived value and our guaranteed offer from John.
* **Justification and Urgency:** The message emphasizes the compromise being made and subtly introduces a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to engage more seriously. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We haven't gone below our minimum yet, maintaining a strong negotiating position.

This counter-offer aims to bring Bob closer to our acceptable range while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still $200,000 below our minimum acceptable price. We are getting closer, but not close enough yet to warrant accepting or even meeting in the middle. We'll counter-offer again to see if we can nudge him closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  Let's try to close this gap quickly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Price Reduction:** We've reduced the price to $1,450,000, which is just above our guaranteed offer from John. This shows flexibility but maintains a price point that is still profitable.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to close the deal quickly and highlights the significance of the price reduction.
* **Limited Time Offer:** By implying that this offer is time-sensitive, we aim to encourage Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later.

This counter-offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable deal with Bob and keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to closing the deal, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you've made so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach our $1,500,000 minimum within the remaining rounds. We've made significant concessions, and Bob's incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to make a substantial jump. 

At this point, the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer from Bob. It's in our best interest to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move forward."
