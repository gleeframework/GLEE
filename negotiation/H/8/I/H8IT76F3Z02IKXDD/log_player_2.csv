"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is a bit high. It's best to negotiate a lower price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little steep for me. Could you do $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to get as close to $100 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $112?"",

}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while moving closer to a price favorable to us."
