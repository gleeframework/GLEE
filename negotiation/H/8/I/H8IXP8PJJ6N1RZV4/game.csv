"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  If you're willing to come down to $10,750, I'd be happy to buy the product from you. That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me.",10900.0,Alice,5,
