"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's less than the product's value to you, it's still higher than your desired budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before deciding to buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,900 is still above my desired budget of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm not sure if I can get her down any further.  At this point, it's more financially sensible to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
