"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's lower than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer secures a purchase at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation.  While a lower price is always preferable, the potential risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
