"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your willingness to adjust your budget, how does $97 sound for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97

``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only asking $7 more than your target price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks either missing out on a good deal or having to buy from John at full price."
