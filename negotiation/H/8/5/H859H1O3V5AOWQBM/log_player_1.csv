Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, aiming high with Bob could yield a significantly higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 sets an anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to this initial price than if we started lower.
* **""Take it or Leave it""**: This approach creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to counter-offer extensively. 

**Important Note:** This is a bold strategy. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a substantial gain outweighs the risk of losing out on a smaller profit with John."
