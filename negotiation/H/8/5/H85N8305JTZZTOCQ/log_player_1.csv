Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Offering Bob an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **High but justifiable price:**  Starting with a price of $1,700,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit beyond John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Clear justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, mentioning ""its value"" subtly implies you're aware of its significance to him.

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential eagerness to secure the product while ensuring you receive a worthwhile return."
