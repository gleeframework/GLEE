"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1300000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, taking into account the value I believe the product holds for me. I'm thinking of $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the original price you were looking for.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. I'm thinking of $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1250000, but I'm also not willing to go any lower than $1150000. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to get close to my limit. I'd like to make a final offer of $1200000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept an offer of $1200000. I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's going to be my final one. I'm thinking of $1260000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
