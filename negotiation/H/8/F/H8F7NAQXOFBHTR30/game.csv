,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 125. How about we meet in the middle at 132.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $125.  Would you consider $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to move a bit closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go all the way to 127.50. How about we meet at 129.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",129.5,Alice,5,
