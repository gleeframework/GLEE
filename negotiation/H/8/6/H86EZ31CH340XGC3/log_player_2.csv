"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than the value of the product to you ($1,000,000), it's still higher than your desired price point.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
