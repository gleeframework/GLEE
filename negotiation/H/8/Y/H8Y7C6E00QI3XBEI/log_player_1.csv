"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **Below Bob's value:**  It's also lower than the product's worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Clear and concise:**  It's easy to understand and doesn't leave room for ambiguity. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While Bob is closer to your desired price, $100 is still below your minimum of $80. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 8 rounds left.  You can counter with a price closer to $120, aiming for a compromise.

Let's keep negotiating with Bob!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but still ensures you get a profit.
* **Clear goal:**  It sets the price closer to your desired price while giving Bob another chance to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  Using phrases like ""fair price for both of us"" can help build a positive rapport with Bob. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
