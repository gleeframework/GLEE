Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal on a valuable item."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 gives Bob the perception of a potential deal and leaves room for him to counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Avoid Lowballing:** Offering a price too close to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might offend him and make him less likely to engage in negotiations. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
