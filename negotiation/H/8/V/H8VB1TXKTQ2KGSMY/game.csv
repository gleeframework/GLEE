"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for in a product like this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
