"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start the negotiation close to his maximum budget, but still leave some room for potential compromise. $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and could be a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000, but still leaves some room for potential profit for Alice.  Accepting this offer would allow Bob to save $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially requiring a purchase from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
