"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my offer?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, how about $93.75? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not comfortable with $93.75. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $91.25. Can you consider my offer?",91.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher, but $91.25 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to reach a deal.  What do you think?",92.5,Alice,7,
