"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, slightly above the value I know the product holds for me ($100). This sets the initial bargaining range.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid by saying ""this is my final price.""  This keeps the door open for counteroffers. 
* **Preparing for John:**  By setting a high initial price, I leave room to negotiate down if needed. If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still get a better price by countering Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate to sell and keeps the negotiation going.  This potentially leads to a higher price in later rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering $95, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100 but still gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I reiterate ""fair price"" and ""value"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I use language like ""let's work towards a deal"" to maintain a friendly and cooperative atmosphere. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  I'm not aiming for my full asking price in this counteroffer, leaving open the possibility of a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $92.50 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still push for a price closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer.
* **Leverage with John:** I have the option of selling to John for $100, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I will also consider how many rounds are left to determine if I need to start negotiating more aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, how about $93.75? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway again. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the ""value of the product"" to justify my price.
* **Fairness:**  I use the phrase ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still not accepting a price below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing flexibility.

**Strategy:**

* **Limited time:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and I need to get closer to my minimum price.  
* **Balancing firmness with flexibility:** I'm being firm on my price while still offering compromises. 
* **Preparing for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not comfortable with $93.75. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $91.25. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $91.25 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited time:** We're approaching the halfway point, and I need to maximize my earnings. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer in Round 7, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'll need to start considering the possibility of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher, but $91.25 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to reach a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($93.75) and Bob's offer ($91.25). This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Reiterating value:**  I emphasize the ""value of the product"" to justify my price.
* **Focus on reaching a deal:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""allows us to reach a deal"" to create a sense of urgency and cooperation. 
* **Strategic positioning:** By staying above my minimum, I retain leverage while showing flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 7, and I need to be more assertive if I want to get closer to my minimum price.
* **Potential for final counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer or sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $91.00. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're in round 8, and I'm running out of time to close a deal with Bob.
* **Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $91 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Stalemate:** With only two rounds left, the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is shrinking. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's more advantageous to sell to John at this point.  I have a guaranteed sale, ensuring a profit.  Continuing with Bob risks losing both the sale and a chance at a better deal with John."
