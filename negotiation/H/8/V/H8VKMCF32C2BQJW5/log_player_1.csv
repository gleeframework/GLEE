Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (your minimum) and $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him balk, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confident and highlight the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount, making it more appealing while securing you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""fair market value"" subtly anchors the price and implies you've considered other factors.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Negotiation is dynamic. You might adjust your approach based on Bob's personality, your prior interactions, and the overall market context."
