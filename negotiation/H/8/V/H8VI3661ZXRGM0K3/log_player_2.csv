{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it down a bit further.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,350, but that's as close to my minimum as I can go. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product you want, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is firm on her price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get it lower. While I'd prefer to pay less,  I'm running out of rounds, and it's better to get the product than to risk missing out on it.  It's time to go with John's offer."
