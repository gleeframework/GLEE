{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm also aware that Bob's valuation is lower. I'm hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay. Accepting his offer ensures I sell the product and make a profit.  Rejecting him and going another round might risk losing him as a buyer completely, and while selling to John would be ideal, I don't want to risk a longer negotiation with Bob, potentially losing time and missing out on a sale altogether."
