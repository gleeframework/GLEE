{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but it's still a significant discount from your minimum.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A much higher price might scare Bob off immediately.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

If Bob rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly to make it more enticing. If he makes a counteroffer, you can then decide to accept it, reject it, or counter-offer again. Remember, you have the option to walk away at any point and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in my best interest to sell at such a low price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my acceptable threshold. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
