"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $975000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1050000.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1015000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,9,

This is my final offer, as I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",995000.0,Bob,10,
