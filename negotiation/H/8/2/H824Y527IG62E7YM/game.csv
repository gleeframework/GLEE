"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
