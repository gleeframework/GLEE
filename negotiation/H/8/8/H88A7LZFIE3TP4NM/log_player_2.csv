Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high, and he can likely negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, $10,500 is a good price considering he can buy it from John for $15,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, and likely a good compromise for Alice."
