Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  It's a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while leaving room for you to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 falls quite short of that mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
