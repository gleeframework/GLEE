"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is getting closer to my limit, I can get the product for a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a better option available."
