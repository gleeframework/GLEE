{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a decent price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to what I'd like to receive, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counter Bob's offer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still not quite there on $920,000. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to come down a bit more."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I really want this product. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant amount below what I would like to receive. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to sell to John. This will secure me a much higher price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
