Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $8,800. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good deal. It's significantly more than my minimum ($8,000) and further negotiation might risk losing the sale."
