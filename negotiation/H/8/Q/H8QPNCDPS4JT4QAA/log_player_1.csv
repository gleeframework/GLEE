**Reasoning:**  Bob is extremely unlikely to go above his perceived value of $1,100,000.  He's already shown a willingness to walk away from the deal.  Rather than risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation that yields a lower price, it's in your best interest to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
