"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our current positions. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
