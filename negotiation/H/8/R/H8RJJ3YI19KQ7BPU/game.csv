"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum budget for this product. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with another seller. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
