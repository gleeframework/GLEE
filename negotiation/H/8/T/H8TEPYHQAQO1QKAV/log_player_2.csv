"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $11500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$11,000 is a good deal for Bob:** It's below his maximum budget of $12,000 and represents a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice's offer to split the difference is a fair compromise and indicates a willingness to close the deal."
