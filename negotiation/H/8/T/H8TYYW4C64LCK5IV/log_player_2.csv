# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to her perceived value of $8,000.  If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
