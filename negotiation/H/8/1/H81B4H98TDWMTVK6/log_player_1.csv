Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.  
* **Testing the waters:**  A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will indicate if he's willing to negotiate close to your desired range.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above $1,500,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob values the product as much as you do.  If he perceives it as less valuable, a lower starting price might be more effective."
