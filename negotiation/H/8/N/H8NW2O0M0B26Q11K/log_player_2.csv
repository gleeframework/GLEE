"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it at this point. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm not going to accept an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, even though it's lower than her first offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the last round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit.  If Alice rejects again, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, though it's getting closer to my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before resorting to buying from John.  I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  It's a bit above my ideal price, but I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  If she rejects it, I'll seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hesitant to accept. It's within my budget, but there's still a chance I can negotiate a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise, offering a price slightly higher than my last counteroffer. It's a good balance between trying to get a better price and acknowledging the risk of Alice rejecting it. If she rejects it, I'll purchase from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly above my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to be fruitless.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's a significant risk that her final counteroffer could be higher than this one. It's also worth noting that I'm running out of rounds. With only one round left, it's better to secure a good price now than risk having to buy from John and pay a full $1,000,000."
