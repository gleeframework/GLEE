Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, rather than just stating a price, which can make him more receptive. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. You need to be prepared to potentially negotiate or accept that he might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at $15,000."
