"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value we both see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
