Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
