Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too greedy might make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value.""
* **Justification:** You frame the price as ""fair"" and emphasize the ""significant benefits."" 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for you. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before you walk away and sell to John."
