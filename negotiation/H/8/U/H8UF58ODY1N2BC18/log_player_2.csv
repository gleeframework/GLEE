"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Since you value the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point.  It offers Alice a significant profit ($50,000) over her valuation while still giving you a substantial saving ($150,000) compared to your maximum price. It's a fair and reasonable price that hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,000,000 and still allows for a reasonable profit for Alice.  There's not much room for further negotiation without risking losing the deal altogether.  It's a smart move to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
