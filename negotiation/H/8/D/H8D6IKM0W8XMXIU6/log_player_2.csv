**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is well above my budget of $10,000. It's too risky to accept this early in the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still higher than my limit of $10,000.  It's better than her initial price, but it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get her down any further. To avoid wasting more time, I'll purchase the product from John for $10,000.  This is the best deal I can get within my budget."
