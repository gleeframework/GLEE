{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value of the product. It gives Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to earn a significant amount of money.  It also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter offer."
