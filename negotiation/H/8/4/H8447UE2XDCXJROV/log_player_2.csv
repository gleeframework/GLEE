"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price. 
* It's worth exploring the possibility of a lower price through counteroffers before committing to the $12,000 offer. 
* Buying from John for $15,000 is a last resort if Bob can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $10,000 for the product? I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.
* Accepting the offer at $11,500 saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  The current offer represents a good balance between potential savings and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
