"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He values the product at $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell it for $8,000. There's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to sell for less than $11,500 (her value is $8,000), and Bob can potentially get it for closer to that amount.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation to potentially reach a price that benefits both parties."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is close to his desired price, and Alice is unlikely to go lower. Accepting the offer at $11,000 saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John and secures him the product."
