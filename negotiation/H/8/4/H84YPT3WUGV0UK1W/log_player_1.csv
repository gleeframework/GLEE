Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This leaves a significant amount of profit for Bob while still ensuring I get a good price above my minimum. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and still leaves him with a substantial profit.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly higher than what John is offering.  This is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation."
