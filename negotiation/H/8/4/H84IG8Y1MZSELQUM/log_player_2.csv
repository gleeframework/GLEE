"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $120. To maximize my earnings while still making it a good deal for you, I propose a price of $135. This way, you save some money compared to its perceived value, and I get a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
