"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $120. To maximize my earnings while still making it a good deal for you, I propose a price of $135. This way, you save some money compared to its perceived value, and I get a reasonable profit. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding my value for the product. While I'm interested, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  This would give you a decent profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
