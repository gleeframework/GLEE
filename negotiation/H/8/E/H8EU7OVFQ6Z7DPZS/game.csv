"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing the details further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our discussion.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I know the true value of this product goes beyond $1,600,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market and our discussion so far.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
