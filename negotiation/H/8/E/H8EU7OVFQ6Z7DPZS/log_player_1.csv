Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market and our discussion so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,700,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's offer has increased significantly from his initial counteroffer. Accepting shows a willingness to close the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal without risking a lost sale to John."
