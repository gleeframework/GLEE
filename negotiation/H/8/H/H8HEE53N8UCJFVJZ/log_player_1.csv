"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is still a decent profit for me while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the potential value for Bob by suggesting it's a ""great deal"" for both of us. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation while still setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  I'm aware that selling to John is always a backup option, but I want to explore negotiation with Bob further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $130 to $115, but it's still a good profit margin for me.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""work with you"" and ""make this work"" to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to reach a deal. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** We're getting closer, and I'm confident I can push Bob a bit higher. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I'm keeping this as a backup, but I'm determined to get the best possible price from Bob. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $115, aiming for a final deal closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my offer as ""fair"" for both of us, subtly appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's make this happen!"" to encourage a quick decision.

This strategy aims to  push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive tone and highlighting the benefits of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $108 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not a good deal for me.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I'm running out of time to reach a price closer to my desired price.
* **John is Always an Option:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.

I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but I'm preparing to sell to John if this round doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $108 still isn't quite enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency.  
* **Compromise:** I'm still compromising by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.
* **Consequences:** I'm reminding Bob that if we can't agree, I'll sell to John. This emphasizes the potential loss for him.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards my desired price while leaving room for him to accept without feeling pressured.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $105, but no higher. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are in round 8, and with only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate further. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $105 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if the price were higher, it's clear that a mutually agreeable price won't be reached within the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the deal with John and move on."
