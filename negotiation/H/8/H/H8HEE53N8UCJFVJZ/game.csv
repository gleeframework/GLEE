"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this work.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $108 still isn't quite enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $105, but no higher. Can you reconsider?",105.0,Bob,8,
