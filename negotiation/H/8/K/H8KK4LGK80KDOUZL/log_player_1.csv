Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the same as John's, I'm not desperate to sell yet. There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
