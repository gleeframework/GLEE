# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant discount and allows you to acquire this asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
