Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000, especially if he values the product highly for strategic reasons.
* **Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I win!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, but it's still significantly less. I'm not desperate to sell and have a better option with John.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting my desired price. It also opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I might push him to increase his offer to be more competitive.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still keeping in mind his potential willingness to negotiate.
* I'll continue to assess the situation, considering John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $1,050,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Justification:** I'm highlighting the ""true value"" of the product to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a compromise.
* **Keeping Options Open:** My offer is still above Bob's offer, leaving room for him to potentially increase his offer again.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his next offer and continue to negotiate, remembering my minimum price and John's offer as fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a price of $1025000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **No Significant Upside:** There's a good chance that further negotiation will only yield a small increase in price, potentially not worth the time and effort.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Pushing for a higher price could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, forcing me to rely on John, which would mean accepting a lower price than what I'm currently being offered.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, as it represents a solid deal that is close to my target and reduces the risk of losing the sale."
