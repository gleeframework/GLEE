"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $820,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $780,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $810,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's the best we can do.",810000.0,Alice,5,
