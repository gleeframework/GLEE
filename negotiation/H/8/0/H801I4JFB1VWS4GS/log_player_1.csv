{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is more than your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you get a decent profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate and still gain value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price higher or lower depending on Bob's response and how confident you are in selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to offer $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's closer to your minimum, it's still below your $1,200,000 threshold. 
* **You have room for negotiation:**  You can counter with a higher price, potentially closer to your original offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Having John as an option provides security.  However, you should try to get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  You are aiming for a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than your original offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:**  Reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him reinforces the benefits of accepting your offer.
* **Be flexible:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, and you can adjust it based on Bob's response."
