Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  $780,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to go down to $805,000.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000 rather than risk Alice not budging further."
