"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $910,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $910,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $915,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. It's a fair price for both of us.",915000.0,Alice,7,
