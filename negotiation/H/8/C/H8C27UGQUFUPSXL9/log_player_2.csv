"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, accepting Alice's offer immediately wouldn't save any money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer at this stage, as he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($2,000 less) sets the stage for a negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  Bob gives a reason for his counteroffer, making it more likely Alice will consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, keeping the dialogue open and inviting Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum selling price. I can do $9200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:**  Alice's offer of $9,200 is a significant reduction from her initial price and a substantial saving for Bob.
* **No Further Gain:**  It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price than $9,200. Trying to go lower risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, while John's price is a guaranteed option. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
