Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a courtesy. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her minimum acceptable price is $10,000 (from John) but aims higher with Bob. 
* **Potential for Profit:** A $12,000 offer leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding her minimum.
* **Respecting Bob's Time:** By stating it's a courtesy and she believes the product is valuable to him, she adds a touch of personalization without revealing her bottom line. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob might counter-offer, knowing the value to him is lower. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A very high offer might scare Bob off entirely. This offer balances ambition with a degree of realism."
