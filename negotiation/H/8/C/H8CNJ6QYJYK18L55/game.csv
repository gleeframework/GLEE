"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

This price still reflects the product's true worth and potential. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing negotiations. While I value your perspective,  $775,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.

Let's find a resolution at this price point.",825000.0,Alice,5,
