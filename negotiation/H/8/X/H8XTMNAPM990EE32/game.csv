"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $11,200, but I'm afraid that's as high as I can go.",11200.0,Bob,6,
