Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I don't want to keep going back and forth and risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
