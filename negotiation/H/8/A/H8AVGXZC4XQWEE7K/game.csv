"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $17,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,500. This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
