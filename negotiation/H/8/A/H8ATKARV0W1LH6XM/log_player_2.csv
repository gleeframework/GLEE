"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is too high.  We can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives us room to move up while still staying well below our $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is getting closer, but we're still over our budget. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a little further."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair price considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

I'm inching closer to my limit, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice is firm. I also added a mention of ""market value"" to subtly remind her there are other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice has met our maximum price.  There's no point in rejecting and trying to go lower, as we already have John as a backup at this price."
