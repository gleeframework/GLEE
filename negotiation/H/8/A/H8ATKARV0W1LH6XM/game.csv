"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair price considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8000.0,Alice,5,
