"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
