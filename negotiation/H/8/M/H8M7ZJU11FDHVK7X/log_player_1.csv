Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start at his maximum price.  Offering a price significantly higher gives us room to negotiate down if needed, maximizing our potential profit. 

* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer allows for potential negotiation and finding a middle ground.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, we can always lower the price, knowing our safety net is $80 from John. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value might make Bob more willing to pay a higher price."
