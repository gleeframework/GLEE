Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even exceeding the value it currently holds for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm really trying to keep costs down. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's standing offer of $12,000. It makes more sense to accept a slightly lower price now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on both offers.
