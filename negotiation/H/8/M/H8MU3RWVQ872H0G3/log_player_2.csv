You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate further. Since you have a backup option with John, you can afford to be a bit more aggressive with your counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would still give me a good return and allow you to get a great product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better. There's room for negotiation, and you have the safety net of John's offer if things don't work out."
