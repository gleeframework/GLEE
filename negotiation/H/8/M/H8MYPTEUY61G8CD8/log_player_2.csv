"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal: save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible. He's offering a price that is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is now lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he saves $125,000 compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and minimizes risk."
