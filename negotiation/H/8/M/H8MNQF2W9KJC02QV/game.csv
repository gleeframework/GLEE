"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $14250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is still at least $12000. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in between our previous offers. How about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll sell the product to you for $14200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $14200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13800, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",13800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13800. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $14100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",14100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about $13900?",13900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13900. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14050. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",14050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14050 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13800, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",13800.0,Bob,10,
