Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price point, but it is closer to what you are willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to your desired price point.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option."
