"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you, and this price gives me a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. This price is still fair for both of us, as it's well above your value and gives me a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $1050000 for the product. This price is still beneficial to both of us, as it's above your value and allows me to secure a reasonable profit. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute limit.  This price is a good compromise, as it's right at your valuation and allows me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
