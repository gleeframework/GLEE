"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me right now. Could we work something closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $650,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm confident the product will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",650000.0,Alice,5,
