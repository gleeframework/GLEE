"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
