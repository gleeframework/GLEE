Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a higher price than $80.  While $80 is my minimum, I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $80. How about we try $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'm not convinced that Bob is going to walk away from the deal entirely, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go any lower than $84.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 84}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $80. How about we try $81.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've been trying to get a higher price, but Bob is consistently offering a little bit more than my minimum price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. At this point, $81.25 is close enough to my minimum to be acceptable."
