$16,000 is way over my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $13,000? That would be a much fairer deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
