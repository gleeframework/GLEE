This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to engage in the negotiation and if he's willing to pay closer to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
