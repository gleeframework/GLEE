"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. I know this is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though she's trying to convince you it's a great deal, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
