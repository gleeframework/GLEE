Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,250,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly rather than overthink or negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you'd prefer a quicker sale at a slightly lower price to Bob over waiting for the guaranteed sale to John.  If time is not a factor, you could start higher and negotiate with Bob."
