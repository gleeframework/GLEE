This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $11,250 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving a significant amount compared to John's price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Alice seems firm on her price. Continuing to push might lead her to walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time investment:**  You've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now saves you time and potential further frustration."
