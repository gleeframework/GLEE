"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that has significant value. I understand its worth is subjective, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a substantial discount from what I believe its true value to be, and it represents a significant opportunity for you. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $800000. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
