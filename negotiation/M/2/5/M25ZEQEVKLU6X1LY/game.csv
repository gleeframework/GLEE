"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, while giving me a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price allows both of us to secure a good deal. Let's close the deal at this price, as I'm confident it's fair for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
