"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, while giving me a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There is still room to lower the price further, and doing so would be more advantageous than accepting this offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price allows both of us to secure a good deal. Let's close the deal at this price, as I'm confident it's fair for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's desired price:**  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than Bob's last offer, and within his budget.
* **Negotiation is becoming risky:** With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to compromise further.
* **John's offer is a risk:** Buying from John is significantly more expensive, and there's no guarantee of a better deal in the future.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a reasonable price, avoids further negotiation risks, and saves a substantial amount compared to John's offer."
