"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering $9,250. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,250 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and I'm happy to accept it to avoid risking a deal with John."
