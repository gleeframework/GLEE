"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. He's trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly. He's still willing to pay more than what the product is worth to Alice ($10,000), but he's trying to get as close to that price as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer, and still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to stay below his $12,000 limit. He's hoping Alice will see his willingness to compromise and be more open to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should reject her offer and continue to try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still trying to save some money.  He's hoping that Alice will recognize the deal is getting closer and come down a bit further. If she doesn't, he can still go to John, but he's starting to think he may be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he still has a few rounds left to negotiate. He should continue to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit and is starting to feel the pressure. However, he still wants to save as much money as possible. By offering $11,200, he's making a significant step closer to Alice's last offer while still trying to negotiate a lower price. This offer shows Alice that he's serious about closing the deal but also that he won't simply accept her price.  He's hoping that Alice will recognize that he's willing to pay a fair price and will accept his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and options.  Alice's offer is only $200 away from his absolute limit, and with only one round left, it's unlikely she'll go lower. He's already made significant concessions, and it's not worth risking being left with nothing by holding out for another $200. Buying from John is the safest option at this point."
