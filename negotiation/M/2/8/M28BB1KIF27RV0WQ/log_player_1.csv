Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed offer from John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures immediate profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob, who values the product more than John."
