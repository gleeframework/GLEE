"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's settle at $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
