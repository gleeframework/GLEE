"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of this product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) than Alice's initial price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $800,000 maximum.
* **Leaving Room:** This strategy allows Alice to counteroffer, and we can hopefully meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, I always have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met me halfway from her original offer, $900,000 is still above my maximum budget and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate further down, but I'm getting closer to taking John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000 for this product. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. "",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct now and stating my maximum budget clearly. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By expressing that I'm ready to close the deal at $800,000, I'm adding a bit of pressure and signaling that this is my final offer. 
* **John Option Still Valid:**  If Alice rejects this, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John at my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's meet at $950,000. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to meet my maximum price, and at this point, it's clear she's not going to budge much further. I've made my limit clear, and waiting around for a slightly better deal with Alice isn't worth risking losing out on John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at my target price."
