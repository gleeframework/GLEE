Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup, but I believe Bob values the product highly enough to consider it. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell for $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a better option than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept his offer."
