"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $130, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $130 is more than what the product is worth to you ($120). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the same product from John for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 120}
