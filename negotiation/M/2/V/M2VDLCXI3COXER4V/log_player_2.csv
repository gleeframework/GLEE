Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.
