"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects a compromise on both our parts, and I'm confident this is still a fair deal. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers, leading to a dead end and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price, and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
