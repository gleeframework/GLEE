Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your belief in the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering my value and your desired profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, as there's no guarantee he'll reach our desired price point.  Selling to John ensures we get our minimum value."
