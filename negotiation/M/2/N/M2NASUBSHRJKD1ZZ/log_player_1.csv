"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to engage in conversation, which can be beneficial in understanding his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Goal is Higher:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Selling to John at this point would mean losing out on potential profit. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still represent a great value for you, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'd be getting by emphasizing ""great value.""
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $8 away from my ideal price of $100. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will become frustrated and walk away, or I might end up having to sell to John at $80.
* **Time is Limited:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal that's reasonably close to my goal. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
