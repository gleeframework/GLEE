Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

We're still pretty far apart. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we try for $75?  That seems like a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $90 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if I can get her a little closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $90 is closer, but a bit tough for me. Would you do $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, which would be $85. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could be stubborn and try to get it for $80, Alice is unlikely to go lower. Accepting the $85 offer saves me $5 compared to John and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price in further rounds."
