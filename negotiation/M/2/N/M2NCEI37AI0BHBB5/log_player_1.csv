"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe that by offering a high initial price, I can set a strong baseline for the negotiation and potentially secure a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise,  lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and the potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counter again in the next round.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to me and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground.  It's also only a small increment above my minimum acceptable price, leaving little room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000.  I'll counter again in the next round. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob, or at least reach my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There's no room left for further negotiation, and I need to secure a deal soon.  Hopefully, Bob will understand the product's true value and accept this final offer."
