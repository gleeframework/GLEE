"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Max:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $9,000 is significantly less than your maximum.
* **John's Price:**  While you could buy from John, Alice's offer saves you $3,000. 

It's always better to get a deal if possible!"
