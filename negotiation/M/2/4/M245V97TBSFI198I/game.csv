"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for this valuable product. I'm proposing a price of $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its true value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $775,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $775,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to remain within a reasonable range. I'm proposing a final price of $825,000. This reflects the product's value while considering your budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to compromise. I propose a price of $795,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",795000.0,Bob,6,
