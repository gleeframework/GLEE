{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in.  This price reflects its worth and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $800,000 to me, so selling to John would be a safe bet. However, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for this valuable product. I'm proposing a price of $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its true value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $775,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to settle for less than $800,000. I will counteroffer again, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $775,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to remain within a reasonable range. I'm proposing a final price of $825,000. This reflects the product's value while considering your budget. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to compromise. I propose a price of $795,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I've only got 4 rounds left.  It's too risky to keep negotiating. John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
