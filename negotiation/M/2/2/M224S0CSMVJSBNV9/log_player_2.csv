"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your desired range. You're aiming to get the product for as close to $80 as possible, and you have rounds left to negotiate. There's still room to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $85.  Let's split the difference and do $86.25 - that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $86.25 and $88, which would be $87. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87, which is very close to your target of $85 and significantly better than John's offer of $100.  You've successfully negotiated a good price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic choice at this point."
