Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. I believe this offer is more realistic and gives us both a chance to come to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm going to stick to my offer of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $1,400,000 offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my minimum, and there's a risk Bob might walk away in future rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose him as a buyer."
