"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's too risky to accept without negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, I believe the product's true value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price. I still have a few rounds left, so I don't want to give in just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. I believe this offer is more realistic and gives us both a chance to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's settle this at $1,500,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate down to my target price of $1,200,000. I still have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm going to stick to my offer of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
