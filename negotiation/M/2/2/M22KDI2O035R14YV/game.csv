"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, I believe the product's true value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. I believe this offer is more realistic and gives us both a chance to come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's settle this at $1,500,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm going to stick to my offer of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
