Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable point, we still have room to negotiate and the potential to get a much better price than John's offer.  It's time to hold firmer to a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a good profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
