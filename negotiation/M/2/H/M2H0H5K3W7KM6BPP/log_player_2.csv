"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,500.**  This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.
* **Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.** Her counteroffer shows that she's open to finding a middle ground, which increases the chances of a successful deal.
* **Time is a factor.**  The negotiation is progressing, but Bob doesn't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer in this round is the most logical choice to save money and secure the product."
