"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
