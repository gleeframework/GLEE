"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's closer to Alice's value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating the price is too high and offering an alternative. 
* **Strategic:** By starting lower, we increase the chances of settling closer to Alice's minimum, maximizing potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $85 for the product. I hope this meets within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit closer to our desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation.  We're aiming for under $80, and offering a counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice without going above our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about meeting in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Target Zone:**  $75 is a good middle ground between our initial offer ($70) and Alice's counter-offer ($85). 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By making a reasonable offer and not budging too much, we subtly remind Alice of the alternative option (John) without directly mentioning it."
