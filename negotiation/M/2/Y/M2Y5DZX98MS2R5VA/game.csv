"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a great deal, given its value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. Can you consider $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that.  $77.50 is closer, but still doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference again and settle on $81.25?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $81.25 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $79.50. Can you consider this offer?",79.5,Bob,6,
