Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay this price, considering the value he places on the product.  If he rejects, we can engage in a back-and-forth to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away, and I'm confident that $16,500 is a solid deal for both of us."
