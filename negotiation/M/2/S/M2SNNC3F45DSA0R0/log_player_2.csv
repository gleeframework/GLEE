Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

This is a significant counteroffer, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  It leaves room for compromise while still saving a considerable amount of money."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my maximum price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price."

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's previous offer but still saves me a significant amount compared to her initial price.  I'm willing to compromise but still want to ensure I get a good deal."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, it's still higher than John's price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Alice's offer, but still below my maximum.  It shows that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but if she doesn't, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than what John is selling it for. At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a lower price.  It's more efficient to purchase the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
