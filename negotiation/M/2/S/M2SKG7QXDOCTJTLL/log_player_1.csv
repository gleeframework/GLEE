"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's  below Bob's perceived value but still higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving some profit for myself.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to $12,000. How about $12,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to settle for the lowest possible value for the product.  I'll try to counter Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $12,500 is a little low for me, but I'm open to coming down a bit more. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $13,000?  This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,000 is still a good profit for me. I've made a good amount of progress in the negotiations and it's getting closer to my goal.  At this point, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to push for a higher price."
