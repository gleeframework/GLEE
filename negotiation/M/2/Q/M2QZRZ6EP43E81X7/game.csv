"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to my business.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think the product is worth a bit less to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1850000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1725000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1725000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1750000, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1725000 is a bit too high, but I could do $1720000. Can we meet at this price?",1720000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your thoughtful response, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In light of our ongoing negotiations, I am prepared to offer the product at $1740000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair transaction between us.",1740000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1700000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to prioritize my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,10,
