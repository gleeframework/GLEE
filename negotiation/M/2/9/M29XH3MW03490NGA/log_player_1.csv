{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room to potentially negotiate if he's very interested. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
