{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My ideal price is $120, as that's my minimum acceptable value.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm offering a price of $100, which is a compromise. It's above Bob's value but below my ideal price. This gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120, I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Value:** The product is worth at least $120 to me.
* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering $90, which is still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $120.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price. If I accept Bob's offer, I'm leaving money on the table.  

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is closer, it's still below my minimum value.  Let's meet in the middle at $105. This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Value:** I want at least $120 for the product.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob offered $90, which is too low.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm offering $105, a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate further while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John will pay $120 provides a safety net if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $95, which is still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $120.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in a position to potentially get closer to my target price. Accepting his offer would mean leaving money on the table, especially since I have a backup buyer.

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try $100. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **My Value:** I want at least $120 for the product.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob offered $95, which is too low.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm offering $100, which is a slight increase from my previous offer but still a good deal for Bob.  I'm trying to find a point where we can both agree. 
* **John's Offer:** Knowing John will pay $120, I'm willing to be flexible but not give away too much."
