"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $11,000 is too low for me, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is sticking to his low offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't risk getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
