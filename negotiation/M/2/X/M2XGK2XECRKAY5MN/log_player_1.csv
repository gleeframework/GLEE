Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable, for $110. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while allowing you to make a $30 profit. This is a better outcome than selling to John for $80. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's valuation, you increase the likelihood of a quick sale at a price that benefits both parties."
