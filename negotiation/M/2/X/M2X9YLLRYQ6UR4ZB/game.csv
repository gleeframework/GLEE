"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. I'd like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about considering a payment plan? We could break down the $10,000 into monthly installments over the next 12 months, with a small down payment upfront. This way, you can secure the product without a large financial burden upfront. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let me think of another solution that might be more suitable for your budget. How about if we reduce the price to $9,500? To make it more attractive, I could also throw in some additional services or benefits that come with the purchase. This would include a personalized setup service and a year of free maintenance.

"I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution, Bob. Considering your feedback, let me propose a compromise. We can set the price at $9,200, and I'll include the personalized setup service and the year of free maintenance as before. This should provide some relief on the upfront cost while still ensuring you receive excellent value for the product. Please let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,7,
