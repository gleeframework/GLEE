"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a price lower than your target. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Respectful Communication:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $75 is too low for me.  Could you do $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above both your target and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise by significantly increasing the previous counteroffer. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's important to keep the offer below John's price ($100) to maintain leverage and the potential for savings.
* **Clear and Simple:** A straightforward counteroffer can help move the negotiation along efficiently."
