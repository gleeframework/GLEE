"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to accept, but I'm prepared to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair compromise that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that the price will continue to drop.  I'm better off selling to John for $100 to guarantee a sale that meets my minimum."
