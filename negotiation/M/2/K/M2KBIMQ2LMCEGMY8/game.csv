"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
