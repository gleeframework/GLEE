"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it can help you achieve your goals. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true market value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $8,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
