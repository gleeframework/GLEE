Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  I'm also conscious of the fact that Bob might walk away if the price is too unreasonable.  $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and leaves space for a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to create a good rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer and analyze it before deciding to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
*  I'll be mindful of John's offer of $1,000,000, as it's my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your need to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $800,000. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000 with John, so I don't need to rush into a deal with Bob if it's not in my best interest.

**Next Step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still being reasonable. I'll consider my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000 when determining my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position,  $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering your valuation.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** I'll analyze Bob's reaction to my counteroffer and be prepared to either accept his counteroffer, reject it and make a new one, or walk away and sell to John.
* **John's offer is still my fallback option:** I'll keep John's offer in mind and ensure I don't make a deal with Bob that's significantly less profitable than what I could get elsewhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We seem to be at a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm not comfortable going lower.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  I have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000 with John, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering.

**Next Step:**

It's time to take the safe option and sell to John. While I would have preferred to close a deal with Bob, his final offer is simply too low for me to consider."
