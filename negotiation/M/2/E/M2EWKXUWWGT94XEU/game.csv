"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's a bit lower than its true value. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,080,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $1,080,000, and that's a great price, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. If you're willing to go down to $1,020,000, we can close the deal right now. What do you say?",1020000.0,Bob,6,
