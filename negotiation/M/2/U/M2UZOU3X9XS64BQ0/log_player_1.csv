"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise, but still closer to my initial asking price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
