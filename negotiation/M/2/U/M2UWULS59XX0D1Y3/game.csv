,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
