"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the product's value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
