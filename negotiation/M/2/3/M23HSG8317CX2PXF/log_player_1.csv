Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob away.  It's about finding a balance where Bob feels he's getting a good deal while you secure a significant portion of the profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it can significantly benefit you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair and attractive offer. "", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps it polite, professional, and hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line.
* **The Price: $1,100,000** This price gives Bob a $100,000 gain from his perceived value, while you secure a $100,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes**

* **This is a starting point.**  Negotiation involves back-and-forth. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you adjust or stick to your price. 
* **Consider Bob's personality.** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave room for concessions."
