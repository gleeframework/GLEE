,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $11,000. This product is worth a lot to me.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is a really good deal on a great product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $12,250, but I can't go any lower than that. ",12250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,8,
