"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500.  That's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this deal happen. ",8000.0,Alice,5,
