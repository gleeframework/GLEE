{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm offering the product for $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and me a decent profit.
* **Keeping Options Open:** The message emphasizes the potential for a good deal for both parties.  It also keeps the door open to future negotiations.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I will always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Could you do it for $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also far below my initial offer of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering at $8,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value Bob will get at this price.  
* **Negotiation Continuation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation while showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Important Note:**  I'm still aware of John's offer of $12,000. If Bob doesn't accept a price closer to my minimum, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's try to meet in the middle. Would you be willing to do $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can potentially push Bob closer to $8,500 or even higher. 
* **John's Offer is My Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a subpar offer. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500.  That's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $8,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's latest offer of $7,500.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm stressing that this price is fair for both of us. This helps to create a sense of compromise and collaboration.
* **Close the Deal:** I'm expressing a desire to ""make this deal happen,"" subtly pressuring Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider selling to John for $12,000.  I'm still looking for the best possible price, but I'm also aware of the potential for a quick sale."
