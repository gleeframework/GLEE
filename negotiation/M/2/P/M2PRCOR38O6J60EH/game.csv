"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $10,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay within a more reasonable price range. My final offer is $9,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still ensuring you receive a decent value for it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Alice,5,
