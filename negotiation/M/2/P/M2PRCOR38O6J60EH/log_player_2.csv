"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob has a backup option with John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $10,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $8,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. He still has the option of buying from John at $8,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay within a more reasonable price range. My final offer is $9,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still ensuring you receive a decent value for it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $8,000. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. Bob has a guaranteed deal with John at a price he's comfortable with.  There's a risk that Alice will continue to reject offers, and Bob could end up with no product or a deal worse than John's. It's best to take the safe option and buy from John."
