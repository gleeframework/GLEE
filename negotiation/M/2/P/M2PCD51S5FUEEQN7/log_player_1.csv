{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still leaving yourself room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to your desired price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it for $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you're hoping for. You're willing to negotiate further with him, but not at that price. By rejecting his offer, you can try to get a better price during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $960,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to your desired price and represents a good compromise.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of him walking away or you losing time and ultimately selling to John at a lower price is high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to your minimum."
