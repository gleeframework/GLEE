Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $100,000), while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000 if Bob declines. This safety net allows you to aim higher with Bob."
