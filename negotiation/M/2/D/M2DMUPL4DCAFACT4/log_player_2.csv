{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget of $800,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget of $800,000.
*  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to maximize his savings. 
* If Alice rejects the next counteroffer, Bob can still buy from John for $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his budget and Alice's offer.
* A price of $900,000 is a significant discount for Alice and still within Bob's comfort zone.
* This counteroffer represents a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.
*  Further negotiation may lead to a better price, but there's no guarantee.
*  Since Bob has a reliable alternative with John at $800,000, it's more prudent to buy from John and avoid further potential price fluctuations."
