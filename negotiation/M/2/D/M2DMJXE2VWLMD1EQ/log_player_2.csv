Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,750 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's aim for a win-win here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's consistently staying above $10,000. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
