"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,750 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's aim for a win-win here.",10250.0,Alice,5,
