"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A significant drop from Alice's offer shows a willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Realistic but still below your limit:** $900,000 is below your maximum but still leaves some room for Alice to come up in price if she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Positive but firm tone:** The message is polite but also emphasizes that you're serious about a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My new offer is $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer,  you can still try to negotiate further to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price. You are very close to your limit though, so you may need to be ready to accept the next offer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go to $1,000,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This offer is your absolute maximum. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Highlignting the price as fair for both sides could make Alice more likely to accept. 
* **Clear call to action:** The message makes it clear that you're ready to close the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $1,050,000, and you've already made your final offer.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, making him the better option to avoid further negotiation and ensure the purchase within your budget."
