Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,200 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  Since he has the option to buy from John for his target price, it's the best option in this round."
