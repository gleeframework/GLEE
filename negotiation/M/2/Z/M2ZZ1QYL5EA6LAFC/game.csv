"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
