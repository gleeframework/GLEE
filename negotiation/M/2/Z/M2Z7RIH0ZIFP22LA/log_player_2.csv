"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John at $150."
