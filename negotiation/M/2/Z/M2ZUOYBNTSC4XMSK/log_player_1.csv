Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for concessions. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a very favorable deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By opening at $1,100,000, you're aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to hear Bob's perspective and negotiate, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Be prepared for Bob to counter with a lower price. Carefully evaluate his offer against your minimum acceptable price and your assessment of his willingness to walk away.
* **John as a Backup:** Always keep John's offer in mind. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, you have a reliable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After reviewing the product's value, I was thinking of a price of $950,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and his perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain Negotiating Position:**  You've established a higher perceived value, and immediately accepting might signal desperation.
* **Explore Higher Ground:**  There's room to negotiate towards a price closer to $1,000,000 or higher.
* **Leverage John's Offer:**  You have a fallback option with John, giving you leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers remain unsatisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and after considering its potential, I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of its worth.  Would you be open to discussing this further?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits and why he placed a higher value on it initially.
* **Open Communication:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging further negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,025,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and represents a substantial profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests he's motivated to close the deal and this is likely close to his upper limit.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation rounds carry the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling the deal. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
