"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's find a way to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
