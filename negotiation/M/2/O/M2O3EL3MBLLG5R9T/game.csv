"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
