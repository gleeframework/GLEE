"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe you'll find the value proposition compelling. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John, who is selling the product for a lower price within Bob's budget."
