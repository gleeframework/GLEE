Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering Alice your absolute maximum price. This makes it clear your budget constraints while leaving some room for compromise."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still staying within a comfortable price range. It offers a compromise that is closer to my budget and might be attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $135 is closer, but I'm still at my limit. If you're willing to come down to $120, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the deal. It's just above my target price of $100, but still within my comfort zone.  It also emphasizes the need for a decision and the alternative offer I have."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, $130 is still above my maximum budget of $100. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed offer from John.  The time and effort of further negotiation may not result in a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity with John."
