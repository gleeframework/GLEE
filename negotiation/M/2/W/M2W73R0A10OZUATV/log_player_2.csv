"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a great price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for this product. While I see the potential, I'm only comfortable paying $11,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than the initial offer and closer to Bob's preferred price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product while still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
