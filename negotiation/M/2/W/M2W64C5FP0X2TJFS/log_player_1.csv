Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation. I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a higher price with him. It's better to sell to John now and secure the $10,000."
