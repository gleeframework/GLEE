Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating, but Alice's offer is still above his maximum budget.  It's getting close, but he's already gone through several rounds. It's better to cut his losses and go with John's offer of $12,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down to his price, and he's risking getting stuck with a higher price or wasting more time."
