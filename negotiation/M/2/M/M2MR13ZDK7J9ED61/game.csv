"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle for $10,750? This would be a good deal for both of us and we can finally close this transaction.",10750.0,Alice,5,
