"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than his maximum budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, so he starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  A $90 price is still within Bob's budget and might be attractive to Alice, who likely wants to get rid of the product for more than $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's acceptable price, he still has room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again might lead to a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible while staying within his budget.  A $95 offer is a reasonable compromise, slightly higher than his previous counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.  It's likely Alice will be more inclined to accept a price closer to her target of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will keep rejecting his counteroffers and he'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting the current offer guarantees a purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a higher price from John."
