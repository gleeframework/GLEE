"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for some negotiation. This counteroffer also demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price, especially as Alice is already showing a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make a counteroffer that's closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise but still trying to get the best deal. He's offering a price that's $500 higher than his initial offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still pushing for a favorable price."
