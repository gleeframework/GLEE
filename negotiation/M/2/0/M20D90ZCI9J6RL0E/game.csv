,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $10000 to me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
