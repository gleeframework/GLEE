Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price recognizes the product's worth while also allowing me to invest in other opportunities. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
