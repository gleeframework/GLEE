"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This reflects its worth and allows for room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price recognizes the product's worth while also allowing me to invest in other opportunities. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your point. However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good return on my investment.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. To find a mutually agreeable price, I'm offering $1,075,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase while ensuring you also receive a fair return.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this product. To meet halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm not losing too much on the sale. Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,090,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'd like to offer $1,080,000.  This represents a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,085,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with other opportunities.  Let's make this happen!",1085000.0,Alice,7,
