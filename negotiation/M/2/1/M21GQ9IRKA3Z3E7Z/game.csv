"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm asking $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its potential value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
