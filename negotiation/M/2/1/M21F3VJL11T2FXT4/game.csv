"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
