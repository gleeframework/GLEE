"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price slightly closer to Alice's minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price. The message is friendly but firm, establishing a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob has 7 more rounds and can potentially get a better price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's last offer, but still trying to get a lower price. The message reinforces the idea of compromise and expresses confidence in reaching an agreement, which could help persuade Alice."
