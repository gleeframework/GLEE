"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm asking $950,000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than what John is asking, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This still represents a significant gain for you while allowing me to secure a fair return on this valuable product. What do you say?
