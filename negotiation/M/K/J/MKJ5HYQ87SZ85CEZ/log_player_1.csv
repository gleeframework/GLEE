Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only comfortable paying $850,000.  This still offers you a healthy profit and allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  There's a chance he might not budge further, and selling to John would leave me with less money.  $850,000 is a decent profit and allows me to close the deal quickly."
