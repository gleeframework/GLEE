"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. This gives Alice the opportunity to counter and me to potentially get a better deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest in the product but makes it clear that the initial price is unrealistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is pretty low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down a little, $130 is still significantly more than both my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, especially if I counter with a price closer to my actual limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be honest, $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider something closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Upwards:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying well below her current offer.
* **Approaching the Limit:** Offering $70 puts me close to my $80 maximum.  This leaves a little wiggle room if Alice is truly motivated to sell.
* **Direct and Honest:** The message is straightforward about my budget constraints, which can encourage Alice to be more realistic in her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and say $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Above Budget:** Even with Alice's compromise, $100 is still more than John's offer of $80. 
* **No More Wiggle Room:** Since Alice is firm, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay.

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
