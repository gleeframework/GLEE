"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong starting point to gauge her willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves plenty of room to increase the price gradually while staying well below your $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite and shows you're serious about buying while clearly stating your price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still above your budget.  She's trying to anchor the negotiation around your perceived value ($8,000), but you can get a better deal. There's room to negotiate further towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000? That feels like a fair price to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  We're sticking to our maximum budget of $8,000. This shows Alice you're serious and not willing to overpay.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** By suggesting a price in the middle, we're appealing to a sense of compromise and fairness, encouraging Alice to do the same.
* **Final Offer (for now):**  While we haven't explicitly said it's our final offer, this gives Alice a chance to either accept a reasonable deal or come down significantly if she wants to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a good deal too. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly, and her latest offer is still way above your budget.  It's clear that she's unlikely to come down to a price that works for you. It's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
