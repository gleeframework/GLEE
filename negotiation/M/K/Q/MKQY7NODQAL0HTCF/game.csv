"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be possible?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
