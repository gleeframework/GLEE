{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm looking to get $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but it's still lower than John's offer, giving Bob some room to negotiate. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer given it's better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer and aim to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm open to a compromise.  How about $11,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for me, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,500. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale to John, who's offering $15,000, just for an extra $500. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale, even if it's not the ideal price."
