Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you, for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so that's the absolute ceiling.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal if he's prone to negotiation, but still nets you a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
