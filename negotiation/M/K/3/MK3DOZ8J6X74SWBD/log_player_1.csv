"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob isn't willing to pay that, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping we can find a compromise here."
