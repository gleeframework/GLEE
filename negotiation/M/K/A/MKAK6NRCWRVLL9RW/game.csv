"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 on this purchase. Would you consider adjusting your offer to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not in a position to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1000000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer at this price point.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value in the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $900000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle, but I need to prioritize my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is my final offer at this price point, but I'm willing to continue discussing if you're willing to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $925000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is my final offer above $925000, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional support and services worth $50000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $1000000. This way, you'll get the product and the additional benefits at the price you're comfortable with. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,9,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $925000. I'm willing to make one last offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $950000, just like my previous offer, without the additional services. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Alice,11,
