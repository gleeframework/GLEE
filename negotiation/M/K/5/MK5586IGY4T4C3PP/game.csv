"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $850000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $845000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",845000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $820000.

This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",812500.0,Alice,7,
