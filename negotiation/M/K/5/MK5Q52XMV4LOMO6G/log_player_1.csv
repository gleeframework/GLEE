Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Aim High:** Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while staying significantly above your minimum price.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will reveal how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Flexibility:**  You can always come down in price if Bob rejects the offer, but you can't go up from your initial offer.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can confidently walk away and still get your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a decent offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates interest, so let's try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you. 
* **Profitable:** $135 is still a significant profit margin above your minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much more Bob is willing to budge. If he rejects this, you can consider moving closer to his price or taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $125? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $125 is still a good profit margin ($25 above your minimum).
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's always a risk Bob will walk away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forths. 

While you could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting $125 seems like a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale quickly."
