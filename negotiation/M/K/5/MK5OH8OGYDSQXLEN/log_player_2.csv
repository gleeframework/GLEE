"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value, and I believe $1,350,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has a lot of rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price.  While $1,350,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high for Bob's target. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to his desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the true value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his target range of saving as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a good deal, Bob has 5 rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to his desired $1,250,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my last offer.  I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
