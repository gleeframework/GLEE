"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value, and I believe $1,350,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my last offer.  I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000 for the product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
