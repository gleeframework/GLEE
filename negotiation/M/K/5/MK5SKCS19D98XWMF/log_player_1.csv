I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a better price than John's offer, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  We have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still securing a profit closer to my initial goal."
