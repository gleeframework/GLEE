"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
