"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to ensure it's a good investment for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're seeking a competitive price.  While $850,000 is tempting, the true value of this product significantly exceeds that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This recognizes your interest while still reflecting the product's unique potential.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my investment goals.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair price, and I'm committed to finding common ground.  To demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I'm proposing $900,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise and still reflects the immense value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and my investment goals. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope we can agree on this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
