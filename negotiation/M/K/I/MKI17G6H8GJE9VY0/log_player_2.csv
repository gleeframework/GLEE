Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, we're also getting close to John's offer. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get Alice closer to $800,000. If she doesn't budge significantly in the next round, we'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price. I'm willing to offer you $780,000 to close the deal with you today.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We are getting close to our walk-away point and need to signal urgency to Alice.
* **Alternative option:**  By mentioning another offer, we increase the pressure on Alice without revealing our absolute bottom line.
* **Final offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we are setting a firm boundary. Alice now needs to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk losing the sale entirely."
