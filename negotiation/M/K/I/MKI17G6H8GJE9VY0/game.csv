"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business.  My initial price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This represents a fair compromise, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from the product. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price. I'm willing to offer you $780,000 to close the deal with you today.  This is my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
