# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your needs. To start, how about we consider a price range of $100 to $120? Let me know what you think and we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
