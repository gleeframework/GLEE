"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, the product's worth to me is significantly higher than $850,000.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,3,
