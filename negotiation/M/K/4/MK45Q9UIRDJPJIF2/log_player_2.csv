{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal compared to John's $120, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $90?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I think we can agree on a price of $105. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown willingness to pay $90, so there's room for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to compromise further. I propose a price of $102 for the product. This allows us to stay within your budget while still earning a fair amount for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $102, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's $120.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product. Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
