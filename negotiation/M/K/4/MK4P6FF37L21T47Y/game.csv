"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
