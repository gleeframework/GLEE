Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $20,000 gives us room to negotiate downward without going below our minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a better deal.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives us confidence to hold our ground if Bob makes unacceptable counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I am willing to pay $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We need to counteroffer to try and get closer to our desired price. Selling to John immediately would leave money on the table.  We'll aim for a higher price in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I'm hoping we can find common ground here. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  We're rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable Reduction:** $17,000 is a significant reduction from our initial offer, but it still keeps us well above our minimum value.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes finding common ground, keeping the negotiation friendly. 
* **Back to John:** We're still confident in selling to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $14000 for it. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below our ideal price. We can likely squeeze out a bit more by counter-offering. We're confident in our position because we have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up to $14,000. I'm almost there, but I need to be closer to my minimum to make this work. How about $14,500? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can make this happen. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  We're raising our offer by a relatively small amount to show we're willing to compromise further.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes a good deal for both sides.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies a sense of urgency to close the deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  We're still confident in our backup option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I am willing to pay $14000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is stubbornly at $14,000.  We've already negotiated down significantly and are very close to our minimum value.  It's unlikely we'll get any higher with Bob, and we don't want to risk further negotiations that could result in a lower price.  

Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees our minimum value and ensures a quick and certain transaction. We've learned that Bob is unwilling to go higher than $14,000, so continuing negotiations with him would be inefficient and likely lead to less profit."
