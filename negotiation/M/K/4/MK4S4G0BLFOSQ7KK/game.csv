"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I may have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is closer to my minimum price. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I understand your position, $1,550,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,525,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1525000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price, and if we can reach an agreement, I'm ready to move forward. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,500,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1,520,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential returns.
