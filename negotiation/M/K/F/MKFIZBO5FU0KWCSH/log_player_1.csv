Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that much to me.  While Bob values the product at $10,000, I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I will counteroffer and try to reach a price that is more fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hopeful that this will be a good compromise for both of us."
