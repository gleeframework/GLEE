"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $115? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
