"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high, especially if you're unsure about Bob's valuation.
* **Message:** I've added a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport and encourage Bob to participate in the negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I've explicitly stated I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility and potentially making Bob more willing to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12500 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'd like to see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to sell you the product,  $12,500 is a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a good compromise and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and expressed my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** I've indicated that $13,500 is a good compromise but still leaves room for negotiation, signaling that I'm open to finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $13000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now very close to my desired price.  Considering we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, accepting his offer seems like the best option. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of rejection and further rounds of negotiation could lead to a worse outcome. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
