"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12500 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to sell you the product,  $12500 is a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a good compromise and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $13000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,4,
