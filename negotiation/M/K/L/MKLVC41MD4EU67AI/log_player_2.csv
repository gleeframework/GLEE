(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. You can likely get a better price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still potentially get a better price than $100, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further."

Round 4

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still getting a better deal from John at $120, but with a few more rounds, you could potentially get Alice to come down to a price that is more worthwhile to you.  There's a chance you could negotiate a price closer to your $90 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 
You've already offered $90 and Alice rejected it, so there's a chance that she will accept a price of $95.  At this point, you're getting close to your limit of $120 from John, so you're taking a bit of a risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging from her price.  At this point, you only have 3 rounds left and it's unlikely that Alice will accept a lower price, especially since you're already at $110.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John at this point to avoid losing the opportunity to buy the product."
