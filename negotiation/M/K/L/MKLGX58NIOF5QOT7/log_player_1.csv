Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which is still a good price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to get a higher price from Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $1,250,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is still a great price considering the value to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering the value to me, I can offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and can potentially get a higher price from Bob. It's not worth selling to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1325000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more room.  I can offer $1310000, which is a fair price and gets us very close to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,310,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle. I have a few more rounds to try and squeeze out a bit more, and I think I can still get a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up.  $1,310,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll offer the product to you for $1,315,000.  This is a small increase from your last offer, and it gets us very close to a deal.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1315000}
