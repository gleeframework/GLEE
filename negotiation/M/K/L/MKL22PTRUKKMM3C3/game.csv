"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you at $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,750, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $7,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my bottom line. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",8000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7900.0,Bob,8,
