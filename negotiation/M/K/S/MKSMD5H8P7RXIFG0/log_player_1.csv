Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500? Let's try to make this work. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, and I'll also throw in an extra $100 as a gesture of goodwill. Can we make a deal at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The extra $100 Bob offered is nice, but it's still below my minimum price.  I'm also getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth. At this point, I'm better off selling the product to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
