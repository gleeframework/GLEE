"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone.",9500.0,Bob,4,
