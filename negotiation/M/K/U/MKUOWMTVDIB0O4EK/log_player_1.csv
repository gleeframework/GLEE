Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit.  I've also included a message that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, but it's a reasonable compromise and within my minimum acceptable profit margin.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
