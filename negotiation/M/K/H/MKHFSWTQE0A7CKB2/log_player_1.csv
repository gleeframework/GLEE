Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Offering a price slightly below that allows for a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob.
* **John as a Backup:** The guarantee of selling the product to John for $1,000,000 sets a strong bottom line. We don't need to desperation-sell to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a final price above $1,250,000 and still exceeding John's offer."
