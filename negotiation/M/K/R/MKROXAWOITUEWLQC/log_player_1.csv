"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, opening the door for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but my budget is closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also below my initial offer.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** I can still get a good price from John, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This price still reflects the value this product offers, while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product provides to justify the price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1375000 is still outside my range. I'm comfortable offering $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase your product while still staying within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to make this worthwhile.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  I'm not ready to accept his offer, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet either. I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to go to $1275000.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1,275,000 is closer to my desired price, but I still need to make a bit more to justify selling.
