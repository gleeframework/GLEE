"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum budget of $150. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always buy from John if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's $120, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Within Budget:**  $100 remains within my budget of $150. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $130 is still above my desired price point and leaves little room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still hopeful that I can get Alice to come down further, especially since she rejected my last offer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** As before, John's offer of $150 provides a backup option if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Alice's latest offer of $130.
* **Close to Budget:**  $110 is still within my budget of $150. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but also have a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too expensive:**  $135 is still significantly above my desired price point. While Alice is moving closer, I'm not ready to settle just yet.
* **Room for further compromise:**  We've already gone through several rounds, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** As always, John's offer provides a safety net if I can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is a final compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer of $135 and my previous offer of $110. 
* **Pushing the Limit:**  While $120 is close to my budget, I'm hoping this demonstrates my strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Time Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to close the deal soon.  This offer leaves little room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $140 is very close to John's price of $150, and I'm not sure I can get Alice to come down further. 
* **Limited Time:** We're down to the last 3 rounds, and with each passing round, the risk of not getting a deal increases. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Buying from John guarantees I get the product, even if it's not the absolute best price. It eliminates the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and leaving me without a product."
