"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet in the middle and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to achieve a successful outcome. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $1000000 is a bit too high for me.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, but I'd like to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Bob,  I understand your position and I'm willing to make one final concession. Given your interest, and the fact that John's offer is on the table, I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925000.
