Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price, as it's above his value for the product, but still leaves me some profit.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in buying the product at this price, as it's a good deal for him as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $100. This is still a fair price for both of us.  It's higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob is still unwilling to come up to my minimum price, I'm not going to continue negotiating. This is a long and drawn-out process, and I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
