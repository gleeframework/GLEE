"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, aiming to maximize my potential profit. This initial offer will likely be rejected, but it sets the stage for a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum.  This shows flexibility while also maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is very close to my minimum, and also closer to Bob's last offer. It shows that I am serious about selling the product to Bob but am not willing to go lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and is very close to my initial offer. There's a good chance Bob won't improve his offer, and I'm within the time limit to close the deal."
