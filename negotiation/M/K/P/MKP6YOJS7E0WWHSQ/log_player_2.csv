# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best possible price for him."
