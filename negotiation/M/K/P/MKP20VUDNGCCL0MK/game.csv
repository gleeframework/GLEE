"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
