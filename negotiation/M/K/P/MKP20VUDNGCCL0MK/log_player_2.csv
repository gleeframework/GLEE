"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significant Difference:** A $200,000 difference from Alice's starting offer is significant and might encourage her to engage in counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room:** While $700,000 is my initial offer, it leaves me room to negotiate upwards towards my $800,000 maximum if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met me halfway, $850,000 is still above my $800,000 maximum budget.
* **John is an Option:** I have the safety net of buying from John at my target price, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Alice. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about a lower price and am willing to walk away. This might encourage her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $750,000."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but holding firm on a significant price difference.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to go much lower than $850,000, I might have to consider my options more seriously. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I can get the product for $800,000 from John gives me leverage. I don't need to seem overly eager to settle with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At My Target Price:** Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $800,000.
* **No Need to Push Further:** There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and it's unlikely she'll drop significantly below this point.
* **John's Price is the Same:** Since I can get the product for the same price from John, there's no advantage to delaying further or risking the deal with Alice falling through."
