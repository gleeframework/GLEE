Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, there's space to negotiate downwards while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident and positive language to emphasize the product's value."
