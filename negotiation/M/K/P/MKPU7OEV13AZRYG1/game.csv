"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle at $96?",96.0,Bob,4,
