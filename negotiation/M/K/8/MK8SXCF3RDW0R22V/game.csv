"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to me is at least $15000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'd like to propose $14250. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is at least $15000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. What do you think?",14250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to me is at least $15000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16000. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's unique value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $15500, and that's my final offer. I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to pay it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",15500.0,Bob,6,
