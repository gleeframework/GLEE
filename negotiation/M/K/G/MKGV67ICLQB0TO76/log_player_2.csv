We're still quite a bit away from a price I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice seems firm on her price, and while I could try to push further, there's a risk she won't budge.  Getting it for $95 isn't ideal, but it's a decent saving compared to John's price."
