"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $92.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90.

"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $93. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $97.
