"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product at this price anywhere else.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal too.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,
