"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I still need to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price further? I'm hoping for something closer to $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my minimum. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
