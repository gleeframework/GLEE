You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000 since it's worth only $800,000 to Alice. You can try to negotiate a better price by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."

**Explanation:**

Although $1,100,000 is better than the initial $1,200,000, it's still higher than what Alice would be willing to accept. There is still room for negotiation. We will reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

At this point, the price is getting close to what you're willing to pay and it's still lower than John's offer. It's likely that Alice will not lower her price further, so accepting the offer is the best option to save money."
