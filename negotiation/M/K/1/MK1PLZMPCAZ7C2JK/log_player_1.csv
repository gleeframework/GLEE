"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher final price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is high enough to give Bob room to counter and still potentially reach a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Open-ended:**  The message invites Bob to respond, whether it's with acceptance, a counteroffer, or simply a question."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away and potentially get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial offer but still higher than my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language like ""middle ground"" and ""fair"" to signal that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $7500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is lower than my minimum of $8,000.  While I could sell to John for that price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  It's possible Bob may be willing to go a bit higher in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we compromise at $8,500?  That's still a good price for you and a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price point but offering a small concession to show willingness to compromise.
* **Compromise:**  I use the word ""compromise"" to emphasize that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I highlight the benefits of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $8000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think that's the sweet spot for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I've already rejected a few offers and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's best to accept his offer and secure the deal before time runs out.  Additionally, selling to John would net me the same amount, so there's no benefit in delaying further."
