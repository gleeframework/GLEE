"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has a backup option with John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product brings to you, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point and his maximum budget. Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my own financial constraints. I believe this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement and I'm confident it will be a good investment for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations or choosing to purchase from John.  While John's offer is a sure thing, there's a chance Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
