Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently inching up, indicating he values the product. We still have rounds to negotiate and losing only $2,500 more to John is preferable if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you've been very consistent and I respect that.  Let's wrap this up. How about $1,110,000 and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** At this stage, a slightly firmer approach might be beneficial.  We are offering a small concession but making it clear we're aiming to close the deal soon. This could prompt Bob to act or reveal his final price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,098,750?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's increments are getting smaller, and we are getting dangerously close to John's offer. Accepting this offer secures a profit significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer.  The risk of Bob going lower and leaving us with a smaller profit margin outweighs the potential of getting a slightly higher offer in the next two rounds."
