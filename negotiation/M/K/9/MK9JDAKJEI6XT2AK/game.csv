"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm still very interested in the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you consider $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I'll meet you at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,800 is a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final counteroffer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not willing to meet you at $10,250. I've already gone up to $9,800, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to consider other options, but I'm still interested in buying from you. Can you think of anything else you can do to sweeten the deal?",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've already gone up to $9,800, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to throw in a bonus package that includes additional services and support worth $500 to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $10,300, I'll include this bonus package and make it a more attractive offer for you.",10300.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your creativity with the bonus package, but I'm afraid I'm still not willing to meet you at $10,300. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
