"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident this price is fair and beneficial for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
