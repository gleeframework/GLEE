"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would be a mutually beneficial deal and ensure a swift transaction. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll see its worth.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to back down on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250 is too high, so I'll go to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal today at $11,250.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product.  Let's make it happen.",11250.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",11750.0,Alice,9,
