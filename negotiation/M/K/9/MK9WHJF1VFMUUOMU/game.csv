"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair compromise for both of us. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $13000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
