Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $15,000 gives me some room to negotiate downward if Bob counters. 
* **Highlighting value:** I've emphasized the product's value to me ($10,000 minimum) to imply its potential worth to Bob.
* **Keeping the option open:** I haven't ruled out John as an alternative buyer, giving me leverage.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I aim for the best possible outcome.
* **Assess Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product. 
* **Control the negotiation:**  I can adapt my approach based on Bob's response and the potential for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired value. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering. I want to keep the negotiation going and explore if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Offering $13,500 shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Reiterate the value:**  ""Fair compromise"" implies the price is reasonable given the product's worth.
* **Keeping the door open:**  This counteroffer is a stepping stone, not a final stand. I'm ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $13000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $13,000 is only slightly below my desired price of $13,500.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob is firm on his final offer, and if I reject it, I risk losing the deal and getting only $10,000 from John.
* **Positive negotiation outcome:** Accepting this offer means I secure a significantly better price than John's offer.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision in this situation."
