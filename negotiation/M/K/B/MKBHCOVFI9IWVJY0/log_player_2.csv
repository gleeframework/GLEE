"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:** You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 

Since you have room for negotiation, rejecting the offer gives you the chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,250.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your offer, and meeting in the middle is a reasonable outcome.

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that's good for you and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
