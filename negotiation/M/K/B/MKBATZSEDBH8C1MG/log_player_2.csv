Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
