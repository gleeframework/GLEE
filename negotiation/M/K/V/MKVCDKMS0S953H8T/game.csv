"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the $700,000 range?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I've given this a lot of thought, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's a significant concession from my initial offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
