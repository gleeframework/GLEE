Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or more. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I propose a price of $1,900,000. Please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we start with a significantly higher offer ($1,900,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not revealing our minimum price, the message hints at the product's high value to Bob, creating a sense of potential gain for him. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the offer encourages Bob to take it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly welcomes Bob's thoughts, implying flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit by leveraging Bob's potential overvaluation.  However, it's crucial to be prepared for Bob to reject the initial offer and be ready to negotiate or move on to John, ensuring the minimum $1,500,000 sale."
