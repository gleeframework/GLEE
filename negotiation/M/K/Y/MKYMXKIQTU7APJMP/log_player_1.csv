Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer than $10,000 may still be readily accepted by Bob, while a higher starting point could scare him off.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:**  While John offers a safety net, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures a higher profit. 

**This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price while still making the offer attractive to Bob.**"
