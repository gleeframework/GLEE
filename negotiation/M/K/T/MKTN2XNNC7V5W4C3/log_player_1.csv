{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's valuation of the product, but not so high that it is immediately unreasonable.  This allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum valuation of $150.  Rejecting allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference at $152.50? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $152.50 is only slightly below your minimum valuation of $150 and is very close to the price John is offering.  Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal and earn a small profit, while risking losing the deal entirely if you continue to negotiate."
