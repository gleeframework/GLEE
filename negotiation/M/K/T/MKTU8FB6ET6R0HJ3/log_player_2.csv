"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $1,200,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than the market value of $1,200,000, Bob can still get the product for $1,200,000 by buying from John. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
