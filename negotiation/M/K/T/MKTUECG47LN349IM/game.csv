"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your counteroffer, I believe it falls short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  I'm confident that this price still reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
