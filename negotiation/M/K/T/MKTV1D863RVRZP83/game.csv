"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $9500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. This still leaves a good margin for you and is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
