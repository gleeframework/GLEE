I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. If Bob rejects, I can always go down a bit, but I'm starting high to see what's possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$800,000 is far too low for me. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to give away this product for such a low price. I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to come up a bit, as I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While it's still below my ideal, it's a much better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
