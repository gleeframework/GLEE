Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value greatly.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates slightly, selling at $14,000 is a significant profit compared to your backup offer from John ($10,000)."
