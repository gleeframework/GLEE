Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, which is the same as your minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000 if Bob refuses. 
* **Opportunity for Profit:** This means there's room to negotiate with Bob for a price higher than $800,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""true worth"" project value and encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer, but never below $850,000.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
