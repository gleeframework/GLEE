Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have budget considerations, but I need to be realistic about this product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above John's offer of $1,000,000.  Alice's final offer language suggests she's getting close to her bottom line. Rather than risk getting stuck in a back-and-forth that might not end favorably, it's strategically sound to buy from John now and secure the best possible price."
