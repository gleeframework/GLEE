"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I can offer you $600,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $600,000 still undervalues this product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects fairness while acknowledging its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can offer you $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget considerations, but I need to be realistic about this product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal closed. However, I'm prepared to walk away and pursue other options if this doesn't work.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
