Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to sell it to you for $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $90, which would be $97.50. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
