Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. While unlikely, he might offer $110, which is still a profit for Alice.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. This knowledge allows us to be firm in our pricing with Bob."
