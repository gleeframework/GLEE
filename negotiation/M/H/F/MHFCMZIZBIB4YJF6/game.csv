"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $14,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $16,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to close the deal quickly.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $15,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
