"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price closer to his desired price point while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate. Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves a $500 profit for Alice. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a compromise! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate, and he has 7 more rounds to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a strategy of incremental negotiation. He's moving closer to Alice's offer while still maintaining a price that's advantageous to him. Offering $10,750 splits the difference between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This approach increases the chances of reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
