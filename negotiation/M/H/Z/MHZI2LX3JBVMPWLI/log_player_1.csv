Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000, but this is a limited-time offer. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows it's worth $1,500,000 to her and she has a guaranteed buyer at that price. Starting with a high offer leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice adds a bit of pressure on Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially leading to less back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Alternative in Mind:** Alice is prepared to walk away from this deal if Bob doesn't meet a price close to her valuation, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
