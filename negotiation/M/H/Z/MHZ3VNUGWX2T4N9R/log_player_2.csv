"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts, as I have another buyer interested in paying $1,000,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product's value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers.  You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
