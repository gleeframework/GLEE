"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll see the benefits and be willing to pay a premium for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, and I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant amount to you. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you while still being reasonable for me. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I can continue negotiating, potentially getting closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if I can reach a more favorable deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $1,280,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the value you see in it. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and her latest offer is just $80,000 above my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's likely we won't get much closer to my desired price.  Accepting this offer secures the product for me while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial asking price and John's offer."
