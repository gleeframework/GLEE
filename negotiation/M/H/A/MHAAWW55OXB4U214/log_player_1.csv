Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. It's still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product, but it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
