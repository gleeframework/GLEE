I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,800. This is still a good price for me, and it's close enough to his offer to potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting too close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lower the price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a much better deal."
