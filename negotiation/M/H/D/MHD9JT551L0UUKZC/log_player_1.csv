Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still within a reasonable range for Bob considering his own valuation. I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000}

I'm countering with $1,280,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum value."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering that I'm only losing $40,000 from my original target.  It's important to secure the sale and not risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
