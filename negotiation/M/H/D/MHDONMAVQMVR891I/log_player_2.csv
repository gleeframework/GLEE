# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this opportunity.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?
