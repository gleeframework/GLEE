"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects its worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this proposition.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be useful to us, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this opportunity.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $925,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
