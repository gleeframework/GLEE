"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  At this point, Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,200, which is still higher than Bob's target price.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy it from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
