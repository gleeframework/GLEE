"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 
 
You are willing to pay $150 at most. Alice's offer is $150, which is the maximum you are willing to pay. John is also selling the product for $150, so it makes no difference whether you buy from Alice or John.  Since you have the same price option and you have a higher chance to get a better price from John, you should buy from John."
