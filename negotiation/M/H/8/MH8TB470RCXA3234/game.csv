"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $140. I'm offering the product to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but no more. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John if I don't get a better deal. However, I'll make one last offer. I'll pay $150 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",150.0,Bob,6,
