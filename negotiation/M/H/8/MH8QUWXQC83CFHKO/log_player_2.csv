"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer and represents a significant value proposition for you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or even find a different seller with a lower price."
