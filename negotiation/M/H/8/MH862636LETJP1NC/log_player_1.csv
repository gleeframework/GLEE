"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still making more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and this is a strong compromise.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to consider my options more seriously."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not yet at the point where I'd be willing to close the deal.  I have a few more rounds to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. Accepting this offer will give me a good profit, and it's only $500 less than selling to John."
