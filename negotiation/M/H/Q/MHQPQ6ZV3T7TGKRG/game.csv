"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this unique product. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This price still reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I'm confident this price point will be mutually beneficial.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider John's offer. Can you meet me at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
