"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I can do $10,500, which is still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
