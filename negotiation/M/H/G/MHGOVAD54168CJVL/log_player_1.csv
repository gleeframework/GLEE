Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, $1,050,000 is still a good deal and much better than selling to John for $800,000.  There's a risk Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to lose this opportunity."
