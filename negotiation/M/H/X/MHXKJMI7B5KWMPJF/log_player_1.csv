Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a profit above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum price of $100, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob rather than accepting such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to warrant further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
