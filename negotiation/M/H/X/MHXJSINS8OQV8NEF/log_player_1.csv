Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for bargaining.  This allows for potential negotiation and allows me to secure a higher price if Bob is willing to pay more.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than what I could get from John.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in continuing our discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold, and I'm nearing my desired price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and the risk of further lowering the price or having the negotiations stall is too high.  

Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a secure option that guarantees me a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
