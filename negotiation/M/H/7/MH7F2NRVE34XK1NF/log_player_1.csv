"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the deal being good for Bob to encourage his acceptance.
* **Openness:** I invite Bob to express his thoughts, setting the stage for further negotiation.

This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the desire to avoid a stalemate and potentially selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,500 is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a subpar offer. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500? This still gives you a good deal considering its value to me, and it's a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight the price as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to me to justify my price.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties while keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's stubbornness:** Bob has doubled down on his offer, showing he's not willing to budge much.
* **Still room for negotiation:** Although his offer is closer to my bottom line, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm not desperate enough to accept a subpar price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more thousand.

This round is about testing Bob's limits and seeing how much further I can push for a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $9,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""meeting halfway"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I add a touch of urgency with ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to close the deal.

This counteroffer is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired amount before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** Bob's offer is a small increase, but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a subpar price.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still hopeful that I can push for a price closer to my desired amount.

I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time and need to finalize this sale soon.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up in price, $8,750 is still too low.  How about we meet at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied. It's the best I can do, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  I'm introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning limited time, which might encourage Bob to make a final concession.
* **Final offer:**  This is likely my last counteroffer. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it aims to test Bob's limits one last time.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  I'm reiterating the word ""compromise"" to make the offer feel fair to both parties.
* **Closing statement:**  ""Let's make this happen"" adds a final push for Bob to accept.

If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John as the risk of losing out on a potentially better price is too high."
