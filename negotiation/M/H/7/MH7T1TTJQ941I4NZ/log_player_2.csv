"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is lower than your maximum price, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, or you can buy from John for $120."
