"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount, and I believe it has the potential to generate substantial value for you.  I'm prepared to come down to $900000, which reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product, as this feels like a fair price considering the potential value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
