{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $90, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for the possibility of a counteroffer.  We'll see if Bob bites, and then adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $85.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $88.  It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're able to work with that."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested in the product but $88 is still a little out of my range.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $84? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $84 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. I'll try to get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $86 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, given its value and your budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 86}
