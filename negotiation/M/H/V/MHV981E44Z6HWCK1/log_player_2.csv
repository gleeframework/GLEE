You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay $80, and she's asking for $90. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

You should choose to buy the product from John for $80. You've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation with Alice, and you're close to your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with.  John is offering the product at your desired price, so it's the most sensible option."
