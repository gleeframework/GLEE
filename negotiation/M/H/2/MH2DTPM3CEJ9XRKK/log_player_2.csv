"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit to your business. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price reflects both the product's value and my budgetary constraints."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the potential benefit to your business and gives me a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, she's still above our maximum budget. We have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is the best price we can get. It's time to cut our losses in the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at the best available price."
