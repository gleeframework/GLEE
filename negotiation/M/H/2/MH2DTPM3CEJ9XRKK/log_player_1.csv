Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential for your business. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to that number by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit to your business. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price reflects both the product's value and my budgetary constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the potential benefit to your business and gives me a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
