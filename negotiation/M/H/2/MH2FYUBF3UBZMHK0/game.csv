"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly less than what it's worth to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is the absolute most I can afford at this time. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
