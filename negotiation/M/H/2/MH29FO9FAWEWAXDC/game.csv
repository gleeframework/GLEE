"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This leaves us room for negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. While I acknowledge the product's value, I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and my budget. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a reasonable starting point.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but to make this work for both of us, I need to see a price closer to $2,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.  Are you open to exploring options in this range?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair midpoint between our current positions, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway between your offer and my previous price at $1,625,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,625,000 is still above my limit. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
