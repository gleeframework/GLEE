"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $14500 is a bit steep for what I'm looking to spend. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
