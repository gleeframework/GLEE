"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to tell you about this fantastic product I have. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob as it's still early in the negotiation.  I'm willing to hold out for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount and reflects my eagerness to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $950,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum.  I'll push a bit further before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget concerns.  Let's make this happen.  How about $925,000 and I'll throw in [mention a small but potentially valuable add-on related to the product]? It's a final offer to show my commitment to this deal."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between the last two offers, a common negotiation tactic.
* **Added Value:** Offering a bonus (even something small) can sweeten the deal without significantly impacting your profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""final offer"" you signal that you're serious and encourage Bob to decide quickly. 

Now it's up to Bob to see if this compromise works for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but I need to stick to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $900,000 is a significant amount and a good return on the product, even if it's less than your ideal price.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has indicated this is his firm budget. Pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Time Invested:** You've spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth.

While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, the $100,000 difference is not worth risking the entire deal at this point."
