"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $120, which I think is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is starting quite high above her own valuation of the product."
