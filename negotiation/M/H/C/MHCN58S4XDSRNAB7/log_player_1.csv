Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $120, which I think is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning any price below this would be profitable for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($120) allows room for negotiation.  Bob might try to haggle, but even if he gets you to lower the price a bit, you're still making a significant profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is prone to accepting the first offer, you might try an even higher price. If he's a tough negotiator, starting a bit lower could lead to a quicker agreement.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John, there's less pressure to make a deal with Bob at all costs. This strengthens your negotiating position."
