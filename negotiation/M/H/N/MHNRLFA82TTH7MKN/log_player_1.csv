Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the price is based on worth.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting other ""interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out.
* **Targeting a middle ground:**  The offered price of $1,350,000 aims for a significant profit for Alice while still being potentially attractive to Bob if he values gaining the product quickly and without competition."
