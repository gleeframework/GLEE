"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential gains you'll still make from this sale. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident in its potential to generate even greater returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room for improvement. He can continue to negotiate, potentially meeting Alice halfway again at $875,000, or making a slightly lower counteroffer. There's still a chance to get a better price without risking buying from John at a higher price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 875000}
