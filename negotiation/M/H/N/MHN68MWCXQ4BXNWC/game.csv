"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential gains you'll still make from this sale. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident in its potential to generate even greater returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,
