"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer, given the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I could go up to $1,250,000. That's a fair offer considering John's offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm targeting a slightly higher number. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000? This would allow me to feel comfortable with the deal, and I believe it still reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  How about $1,400,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us much closer to a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate the significant jump in your offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
