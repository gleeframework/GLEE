"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still cannot exceed $10,000. Would you be open to discussing this further?",10000.0,Bob,4,
