{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still potentially making a deal with Bob.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects, but I also have the option to go with John's offer if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I can't compromise that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'm confident I can sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still cannot exceed $10,000. Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $10,000.  That's far too low for me.  I'm not willing to keep negotiating and risk losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  I'll go with John's offer and get the price I want."
