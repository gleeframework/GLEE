Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Time Pressure (Slight):** By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" you create a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You know your minimum ($12,000) and John provides a safety net, giving you some leverage in the negotiation."
