"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit.  A high initial offer leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While seemingly high, framing the price around the product's ""value and potential"" provides a reason beyond a simple number.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is positive and suggests we're open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal.

It's a balancing act. We want to start high but not scare Bob away entirely, especially since we have the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, it's still significantly below our desired profit margin. We have room to negotiate and eight rounds left to try and bridge the gap.  We'll counter with a price closer to our minimum but still giving Bob a sense that we're willing to move."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To move things forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Move:** We start by recognizing Bob's offer and reiterate our interest in a deal, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We clearly state $1,200,000 is too low but counter with a substantial drop from our initial price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Justification:** We frame the reduction as a significant concession on our part, emphasizing our desire to close the deal. 

By lowering the price but still staying significantly above Bob's offer, we signal our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend, But Not Enough:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating in good faith, moving closer to our range. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant amount below our $1,200,000 minimum.

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. We still have rounds and time to see if he's truly firm or just applying pressure.

* **John as a Backstop:** We're not desperate. John's offer guarantees our minimum, so we have some leverage to push further with Bob.

We'll counter in the next round, aiming to break past the halfway point and closer to our desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It seems we're getting closer. How about we bridge the remaining gap â€“ I can come down to $1,375,000.  This reflects my strong desire to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** We acknowledge Bob's effort and his use of ""halfway"" by mirroring his language, fostering a collaborative spirit.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're not meeting him exactly at the halfway point, but our offer shows significant movement from our previous $1,450,000. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Introducing a slight time pressure with ""close the deal today"" might nudge Bob towards a decision. 

We are aiming for a price above $1,300,000 while still signaling our willingness to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While $1,325,000 is not ideal, it's a reasonable profit and significantly above our guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Further haggling over small increments carries the risk of Bob walking away.

* **""Final Offer"" Repetition:** Bob has used ""final offer"" twice now. While likely a tactic, it indicates increasing firmness on his part.

* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now brings in a good profit immediately.  Continuing negotiations prolongs the uncertainty, and even a slightly better deal later might not outweigh the time value of accepting now.

This seems like the right point to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a good deal without pushing Bob away."
