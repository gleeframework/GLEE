Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the product's value as possible. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price for me, considering the value of the product to him, and I'm happy to close the deal."
