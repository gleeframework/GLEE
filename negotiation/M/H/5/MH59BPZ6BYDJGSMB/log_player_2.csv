"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,500. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget and Alice's minimum. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to negotiate without dropping below her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fantastic product and well worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal entirely by continuing to counteroffer is now higher.  It's a good balance between saving money and ensuring Bob gets the product."
