Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a bit more, $87 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's not worth risking John changing his mind or Bob walking away for a few extra dollars."
