"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've been trying to negotiate a fair price, but it feels like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to be closer to my budget. I'll offer $785000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John.",785000.0,Bob,8,
