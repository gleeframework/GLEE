Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer significantly exceeds your minimum, but it allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the value of the product without revealing your bottom line.

**Next Steps:**

Based on Bob's response, you can adjust your offer. If he rejects, you can gradually lower the price, knowing you have John as a backup. Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the sale."
