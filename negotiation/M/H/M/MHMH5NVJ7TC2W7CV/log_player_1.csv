"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm hoping to get it for a bit lower.  How about $9000?  That still gives you a good profit and is within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $9,000 is still a bit too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This price still gives you a fantastic value and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get it for $9100. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $9,100 is close enough to my target, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
