"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This price still gives you a fantastic value and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.
