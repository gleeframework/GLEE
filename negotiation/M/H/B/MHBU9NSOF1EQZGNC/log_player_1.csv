{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not giving the product away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has incentive to counteroffer if he wants a lower price. 
* **It reflects the potential value to Bob:** You've acknowledged that the product is worth more to him, but you're still aiming for a good profit.

Keep in mind: 
* You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.
* If negotiations get too drawn out, you have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your desired profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating for a better price. You can either counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $10,000, which is exactly what John is willing to pay.  While it's not ideal to make no profit,  it's the most sensible choice given the current situation. 

Here's why:

* **No further negotiation:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer.  
* **Equal value to John:** Selling to John guarantees you the same amount as Bob's offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer from Bob or a protracted negotiation.

Selling to John avoids further risk and ensures a guaranteed sale."
