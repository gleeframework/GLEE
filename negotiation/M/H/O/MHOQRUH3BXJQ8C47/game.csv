"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above what I would be willing to accept from other buyers. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
