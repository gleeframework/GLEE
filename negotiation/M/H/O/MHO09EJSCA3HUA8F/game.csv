"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. How about we meet at $850000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a deal at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this unique product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
