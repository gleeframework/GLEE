"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, I believe $820,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $900,000, so I'd like to offer $860,000. Can we discuss further?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $880,000?  This recognizes the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for me.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $880,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is $30,000 less than your last offer. Can we meet at this price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
