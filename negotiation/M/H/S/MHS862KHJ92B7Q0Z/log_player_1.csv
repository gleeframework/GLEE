"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value, we establish a firm position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows us to assess Bob's eagerness and potential to meet our desired price range. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the safety net of John's $800,000 offer, allowing us to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our target and even dips below our guaranteed sale price with John.  We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring him closer to our desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, I believe $820,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We're signaling that we're serious about achieving a higher price point while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering a midpoint between our previous offer and his suggests willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value reminds Bob of the potential benefits and justifies the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $900,000, so I'd like to offer $860,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to our desired range, we still have negotiating power.  We're above John's offer, have time on our side, and Bob is clearly interested.  We'll continue to counter in hopes of securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $880,000?  This recognizes the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for me."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** We're making a smaller concession this round, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The language focuses on finding a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Strong Position:**  We're still well above John's offer, giving us leverage to hold firm on this price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $880,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is $30,000 less than your last offer. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $850,000 is a significant profit above our guaranteed $800,000 with John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to push for a small increase risks Bob walking away, especially as his counteroffer increments are getting smaller.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now allows us to move on to other opportunities rather than risking further delays."
