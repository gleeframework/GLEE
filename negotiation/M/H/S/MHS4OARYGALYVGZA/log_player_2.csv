"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's worth $18000 to us. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is way above his limit, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, I propose a price of $15500. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $15,500 is closer to his limit, but still higher. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's the maximum I'm able to pay."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see, Bob. Thank you for your continued interest. After reevaluating our costs and market positioning, I am willing to consider your offer more closely. Therefore, I propose a price of $14500 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our valuation and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he is still determined to see if he can get it for $12,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $14,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000.  It's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Understood, Bob. I respect your position and am prepared to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose a final offer of $13500 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made it clear that he's not willing to go above $12,000. While Alice has come down in price, she's still not willing to meet Bob's limit.  It's clear that further negotiations are unlikely to be successful. Bob should buy from John and save himself the time and effort of more negotiations."
