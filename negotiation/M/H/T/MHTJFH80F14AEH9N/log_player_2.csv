"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering. While John offers a guaranteed price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Buying from John is still a backup option, but the goal is to get the product for the lowest price possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $875,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now just $15,000 above Bob's ideal price. This is a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better deal. Buying from John would cost considerably more, making Alice's offer the best choice at this point."
