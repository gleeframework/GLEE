"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows me to get a good price while also being potentially appealing to Bob. It's important to start with a reasonable offer to ensure the negotiations continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still too early to sell to John. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer will allow me to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
