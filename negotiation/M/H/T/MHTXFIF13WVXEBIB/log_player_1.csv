Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to start high with Bob to see if I can maximize my profit.
* **Slight negotiation room:** Offering a price slightly below my minimum ($1,450,000) allows for some negotiation if Bob counters. This keeps me above my fallback option while potentially securing a deal.
* **Open to discussion:** The message aims to be collaborative rather than demanding. I want Bob to feel comfortable engaging in a discussion that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By starting high and showing a willingness to negotiate, I increase my chances of securing the best possible price from Bob, knowing I have John as a reliable backup."
