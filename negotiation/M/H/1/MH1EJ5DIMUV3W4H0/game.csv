"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well above my estimated value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $900,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
