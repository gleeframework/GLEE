"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and Bob can always fall back on buying from John if necessary."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well above my estimated value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and countering again. He can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $900,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still $250,000 above Bob's maximum budget. While there is potential to negotiate further, the risk of continuing is high. If Bob rejects this offer, there is no guarantee Alice will lower the price enough to make it worthwhile.  It's more prudent to accept the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000, avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
