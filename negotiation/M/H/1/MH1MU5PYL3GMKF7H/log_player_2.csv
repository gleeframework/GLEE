"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $10,000, which is $2,000 less than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is $2,000 more than Alice's offer, but at least I'll get the product for its worth to me.
