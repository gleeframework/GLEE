Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $950,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $925,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more. It's time to close this deal."
