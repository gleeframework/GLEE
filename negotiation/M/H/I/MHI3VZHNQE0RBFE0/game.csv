"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price, how about we settle on $1,120,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're still far apart, Alice. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,080,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,080,000 is closer to your valuation, it's still a significant difference for me. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000 as my final offer.  This is a substantial compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
