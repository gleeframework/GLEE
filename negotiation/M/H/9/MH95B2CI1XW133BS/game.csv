"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us. My initial offer is $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. While $900,000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm open to finding common ground.  Let's split the difference.  Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? This would give you a substantial price advantage while still allowing me to recover a portion of the value of the product.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit of a lower price point. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
