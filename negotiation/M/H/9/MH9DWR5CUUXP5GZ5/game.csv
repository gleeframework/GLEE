"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a significant undervaluation of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $950,000 is still too far below the true value of this product. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I've already offered $950,000 and you're only willing to come down by $50,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
