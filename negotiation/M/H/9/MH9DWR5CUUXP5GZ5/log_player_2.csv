"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a significant undervaluation of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. What do you think?
