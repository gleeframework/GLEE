"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you a good deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
