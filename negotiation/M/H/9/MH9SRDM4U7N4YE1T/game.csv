"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
