Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

It seems like Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
