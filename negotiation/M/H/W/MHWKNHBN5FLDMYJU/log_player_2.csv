"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $8,000 is the optimal decision."
