Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit high, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a price of $1,325,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I propose a price of $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of losing the deal and paying a higher price with John."
