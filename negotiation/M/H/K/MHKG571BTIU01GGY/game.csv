"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable range. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
