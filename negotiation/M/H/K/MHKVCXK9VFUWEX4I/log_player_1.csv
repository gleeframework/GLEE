Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500, as that's below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I hope it will be more appealing to him.
