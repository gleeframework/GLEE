"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
