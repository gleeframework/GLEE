"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you ($800,000). While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than the $800,000 you'd pay John, and it saves you $100,000 compared to your initial counteroffer. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to sell. Accepting this offer seems like the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
