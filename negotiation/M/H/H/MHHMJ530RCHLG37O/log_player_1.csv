Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000.

I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
