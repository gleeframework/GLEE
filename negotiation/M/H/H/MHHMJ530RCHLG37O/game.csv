"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it.",700000.0,Alice,3,
