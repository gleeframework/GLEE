"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal, and he knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. By offering $8,500, Bob is showing he's serious about buying, but also that he's willing to push for a lower price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's better to continue trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John. Bob can use the fact that he's willing to pay more than Alice's minimum to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and has a clear price point in mind. By sticking to his initial counteroffer of $8,500, Bob demonstrates consistency and puts the ball back in Alice's court. This approach helps to maintain a firm position without appearing too stubborn."
