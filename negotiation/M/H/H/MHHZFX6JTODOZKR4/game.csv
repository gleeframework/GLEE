"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $100?  That seems like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120? This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
