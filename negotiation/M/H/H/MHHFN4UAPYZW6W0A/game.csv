"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise between our previous offers.",16000.0,Alice,5,
