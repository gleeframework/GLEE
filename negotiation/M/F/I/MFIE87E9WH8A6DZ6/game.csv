"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
