"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $150 seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider something closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $115 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I can't go as low as $95, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
