"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me at the moment. I'm more comfortable with something around $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's meet closer to the middle - How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,700,000. This represents a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
