Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
