(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but her lowering it indicates she's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer further pushes for a lower price but remains within a reasonable range considering the product's value. The goal is to find a middle ground where both of us can agree."
