I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This gives Bob a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point for me to hopefully get more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. It's below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'm going to sell to him."
