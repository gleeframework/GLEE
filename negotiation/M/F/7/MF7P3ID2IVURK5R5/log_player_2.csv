Alice is back to her original price. This suggests she might be unwilling to budge much further. I'm still going to try one more counteroffer, but if it doesn't work, I might have to consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're at the final stages of negotiation, and Alice is not willing to come down further. While I'd like to continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. To avoid the risk of running out of time, I'll buy the product from John at $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it ensures I get the product."
