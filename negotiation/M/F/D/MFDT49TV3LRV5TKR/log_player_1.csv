"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high that it immediately shuts down the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise. 

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below my initial offer. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $12,000, I see an opportunity to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $9,000 as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Although Bob has lowered his offer, I still see the potential for negotiation. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, keeping the negotiation alive.

I'm hoping to find a compromise that satisfies both our needs without selling to John, especially since I have 6 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $8,750? This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $8,750 is a halfway point between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's latest offer of $8,200.
* **Concession emphasized:** I highlight this as a significant concession to show good faith and encourage acceptance.
* **Fairness appeal:** Again, I frame the price as fair to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

This counteroffer shows commitment to negotiation while aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is close:** Although Bob is getting closer to my desired range, I still believe there's room for improvement.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, keeping the negotiation alive.

I am willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob for a few more rounds because, with only 4 rounds remaining, I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000. I'm hoping to find a compromise that satisfies both our needs without resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible here. I'm willing to go down to $8,600. This is really my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** While it's still below my minimum, it's a small concession to demonstrate flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price one last time.

With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to close the deal at a price slightly lower than my desired $12,000 while maintaining a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,400. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is dwindling. 
* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,400 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired $12,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $12,000, which is more than what I'd get from Bob at this stage.

Given the limited time and the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially failing, I'm choosing to maximize my profit by selling to John."
