Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle the price down.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we start high, we don't want to be unreasonable. $140 is a strong profit margin for you (Alice) and still significantly below your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message focuses on value rather than just the price, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the benefits beyond the raw cost."
