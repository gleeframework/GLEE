"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 to start.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While that price is closer, it's still a bit much for my budget. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground here.  $1,250,000 is closer, but to be frank, I can't go any lower than $1,650,000.  This is my final offer; let me know if it works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
