You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground here.  $1,250,000 is closer, but to be frank, I can't go any lower than $1,650,000.  This is my final offer; let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,650,000.  Since John offers the product for $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
