"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get the product without going over budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $15000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000, which is $15500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,7,
