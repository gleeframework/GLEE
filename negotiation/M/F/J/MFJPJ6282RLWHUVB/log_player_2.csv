"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for a better price from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so he has time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get the product without going over budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $16500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  He still has 5 rounds remaining, and there's a possibility Alice might drop her price even further.  There's also the option of buying from John if he can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000, which is $15500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has indicated that $15,500 is her final offer, and while this is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He's already spent 6 rounds negotiating, and the risk of continuing is that Alice might not budge further. John is offering the product at Bob's ideal price, and it's more beneficial to close the deal with him."
