"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. Let's meet in the middle. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. If you're still not able to accept this offer, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
