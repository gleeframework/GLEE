"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is above my budget. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to pay significantly less than my $100 maximum, so I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $80 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and show Alice I'm genuinely interested in the product while still being firm on my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down a bit, but $110 is still above my budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds left to try and get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle on $90? That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Slowly:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but only in small increments.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** I'm trying to nudge the negotiation towards a price closer to the middle of our current positions.
* **Projecting Fairness:**  Phrasing like ""fair compromise"" can help maintain a positive tone and encourage Alice to reciprocate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $90. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still more than I need to pay. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can always buy the product from John for $100, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not fully comfortable with.
* **More Rounds:** There's still time to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you close to that point. Would you consider $95? That's a strong offer, and it saves me having to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding firm around my budget, but also acknowledging Alice's position.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  Subtly mentioning ""other options"" (John) reminds Alice that I have a backup plan if we can't reach an agreement.
* **Final Offer Tone:** While not my absolute final offer, I'm framing this as a strong offer to encourage Alice to seriously consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make a final concession. How about we meet at $100? That's my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Alice has come down to $100, which is the same price John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of Lower Price:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting this offer saves me the effort of further negotiation or going through the process of buying from John."
