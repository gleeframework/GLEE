"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. It's still a great deal for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $8500? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit away from your offer. How about $8750?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price. How about $8250? It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",8250.0,Bob,6,
