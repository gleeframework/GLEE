"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? ",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
