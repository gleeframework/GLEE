"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of immense value to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that will be mutually beneficial.  Consider this my best offer:   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your Maximum Value:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her, that's not relevant to your decision. You are focused on the value *to you* and the best possible price."
