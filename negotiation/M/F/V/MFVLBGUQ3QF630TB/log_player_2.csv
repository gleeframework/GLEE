(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget, and even higher than the product's worth to her.  It makes no sense to accept.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is the same price John is selling it for. This is a strong starting point, and it clearly communicates my budget and limits. While I don't expect Alice to accept this immediately, it sets the stage for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to the product's value to her, it's still above my budget. I'm not going to accept anything higher than $800,000 right now. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  While I'm still aiming for $800,000, I want to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to compromise a little.  This also helps gauge how far she's willing to go to close the deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can continue to negotiate and get a better price, especially since I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still staying below my maximum budget and keeping the pressure on Alice. This counteroffer also indicates that I'm moving closer to her, making it more likely that she'll accept in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not ready to accept. I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a better price with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show Alice I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm staying within my budget. If Alice accepts, I get a good deal, and if she doesn't, I can still purchase from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final round. While Alice's offer is tempting and only slightly above my initial target, I have to consider the risk. If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and I'll be left with no product. At this point, it's better to play it safe and buy the product from John. It's within my budget, and I'm guaranteed to get the product."
