"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John for $80. Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to achieve your goal of saving as much money as possible."
