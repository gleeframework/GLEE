"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $250,000.  Alice is likely bluffing about another buyer to pressure you."
