"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your $150 maximum, there's a chance of getting a better price. Alice is clearly trying to profit, so there might be room for negotiation."
