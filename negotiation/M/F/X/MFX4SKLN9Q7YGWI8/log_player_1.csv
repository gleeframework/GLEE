Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, he's still trying to lowball us.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, potentially reaching a stalemate, and losing out on John's offer.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
