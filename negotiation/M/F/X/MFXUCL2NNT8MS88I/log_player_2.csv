{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.  Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's offer, but you can potentially get a better deal. You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her or find an even better deal elsewhere."
