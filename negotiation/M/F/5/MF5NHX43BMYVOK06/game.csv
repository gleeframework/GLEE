"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I see the value you're offering, I'm still a bit higher than $950000.  I'd be willing to pay $900000. This is a good compromise, and still leaves us both with a profitable deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $925000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for profit on both sides.",925000.0,Alice,3,
