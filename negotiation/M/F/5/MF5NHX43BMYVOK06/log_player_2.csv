"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I see the value you're offering, I'm still a bit higher than $950,000.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This is a good compromise, and still leaves us both with a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $925000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for profit on both sides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is closer to my desired price point of $900,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting her offer means I save $275,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise."
