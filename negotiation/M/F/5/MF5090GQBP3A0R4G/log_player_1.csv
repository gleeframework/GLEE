Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** Since the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($150) than to you ($80), aiming high initially allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** The $130 offer signals that you're willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage further. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, you're subtly anchoring his perception of the price to a higher point.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is a good profit, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message implies he's trying to find a better deal elsewhere, which might not be entirely true.  Let's see if we can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. While I can't go as low as $110, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate fairly. 
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting a specific price ($120), we're aiming to anchor the negotiation around a higher point than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This counteroffer still ensures a significant profit margin for you while potentially being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible deal, but $115 is a solid profit margin for you. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk pushing Bob away and potentially having to settle for John's $80 offer."
