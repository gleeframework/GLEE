I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still ensuring I'm making a profit.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my floor price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that Bob will accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John, as I'm not sure how much lower I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's still a significant profit and I'm not sure I can get a better offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale."
