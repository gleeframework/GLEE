Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to extend this discounted rate to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting a higher price from Bob is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our $15,000 minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes value, suggesting the discounted price is a special opportunity for Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
