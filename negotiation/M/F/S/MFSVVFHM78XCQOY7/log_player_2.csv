"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to extend this discounted rate to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John at $12,000.  You stand to save $2,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
