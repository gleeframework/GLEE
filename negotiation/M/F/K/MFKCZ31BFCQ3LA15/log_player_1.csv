"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
