It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get the price down closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it's still above my maximum price. This should show Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
