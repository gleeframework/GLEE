Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is getting closer to your maximum, but it's still higher than your desired price.  At this point, it's more likely you'll get stuck in a negotiation loop with no guarantee of a lower price.  Buying from John for $150 guarantees you get the product and saves you the time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
