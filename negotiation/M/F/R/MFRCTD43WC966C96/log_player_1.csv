Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's very eager, while still securing a great deal for yourself.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any deal, potentially making him walk away.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation: Bob gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value, and you make a significant profit above your minimum."
