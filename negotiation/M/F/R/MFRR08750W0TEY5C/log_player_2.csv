{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better deals without committing to a price that's still above his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives Bob leverage to secure a better deal. He is aiming for a price closer to his maximum, leaving room for further compromises if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired range. He wants to secure the product for as little as possible, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows him to potentially get a lower price.  He's hoping to get closer to his target price with a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price within his budget. This counteroffer is a compromise, potentially appealing to Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is both acceptable to Bob and likely close to Alice's minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a significantly higher cost."
