"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,500? This gives us both some room to compromise. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? This price is still within your stated value for the product and gives me a fair return.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's the maximum I can offer. I hope you can consider it. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,6,
