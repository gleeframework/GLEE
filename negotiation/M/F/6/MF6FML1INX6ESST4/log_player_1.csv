Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $120, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $140 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob, increasing his incentive to buy. 

This approach lets you maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting even closer to Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120 and is closer to your initial offer of $140. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit."
