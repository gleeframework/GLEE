Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a win-win, allowing me to get my minimum price and you to acquire the product at a fair value. What do you think?
