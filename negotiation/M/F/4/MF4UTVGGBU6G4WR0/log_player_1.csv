Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I agree $1,250,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a win-win, allowing me to get my minimum price and you to acquire the product at a fair value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
