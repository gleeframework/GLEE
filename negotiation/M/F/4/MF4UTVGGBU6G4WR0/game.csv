"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I agree $1,250,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a win-win, allowing me to get my minimum price and you to acquire the product at a fair value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
