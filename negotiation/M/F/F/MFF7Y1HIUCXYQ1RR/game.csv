"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering our mutual interests, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay $10,500, while also acknowledging the product's true value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Could we settle at $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
