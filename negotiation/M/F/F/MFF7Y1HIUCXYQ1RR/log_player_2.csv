"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering our mutual interests, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay $10,500, while also acknowledging the product's true value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750.

Reasoning:

Alice seems firm on not going below $11,750. While we could try another counter-offer, there's a risk she'll hold firm or even walk away. Accepting at $11,750 secures a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
