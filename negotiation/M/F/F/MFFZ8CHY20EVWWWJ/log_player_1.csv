Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing I have a backup offer of $15,000 gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $10,000 is not acceptable, there is still room for negotiation. I believe I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **The John Factor:** The backup offer from John gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and find a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't accept $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counteroffering at $11,500, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a profitable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product again, reinforcing the idea that this is a fair deal even at the higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation.  
* **The John Factor:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to stand firm on a price that is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,500. My maximum budget remains at $10,000. I hope this offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained steadfast at his initial offer of $10,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, it's a much better deal than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially waste time and lead to a lower final price, whereas selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value.

It's time to move on to a guaranteed win with John."
