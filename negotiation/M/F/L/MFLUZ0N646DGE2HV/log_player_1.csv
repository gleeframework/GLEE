Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm offering it to you for $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob will buy it for $800,000. This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit without unnecessary negotiation.
* **Direct Approach:**  Offering a fair price upfront can build trust and potentially lead to a quicker sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** By offering the product at Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I need to sell the product quickly and want to avoid lengthy negotiations. If time is not a constraint, I could start with a higher offer and potentially negotiate down to a price closer to $1,000,000."
