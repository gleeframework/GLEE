"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $13,000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling the product for $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth the investment. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. That's my absolute maximum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000, and I'll include a one-year warranty, which is normally valued at $1,000. This way, you'll get the product and the peace of mind that comes with a warranty at the price you're willing to pay.",12000.0,Alice,7,
