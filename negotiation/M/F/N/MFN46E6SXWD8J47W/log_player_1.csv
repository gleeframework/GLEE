"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, $90 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $95? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $95 might be a little higher than you were hoping for. However, it's still a fair price for the value you're getting with this product.  I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
