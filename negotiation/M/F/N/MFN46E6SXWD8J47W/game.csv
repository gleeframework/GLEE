"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $95? That would work much better for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $95 might be a little higher than you were hoping for. However, it's still a fair price for the value you're getting with this product.  I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
