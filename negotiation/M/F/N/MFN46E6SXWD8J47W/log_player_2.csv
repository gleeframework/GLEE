Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $95 might be a little higher than you were hoping for. However, it's still a fair price for the value you're getting with this product.  I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.
