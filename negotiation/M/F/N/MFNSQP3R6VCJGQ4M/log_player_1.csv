Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?

While Bob is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to accept, holding out for more than $100 isn't worth the risk of losing both buyers. John provides a guaranteed $150, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for a lower price with Bob."
