{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it would be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** We aim to sell it for the highest price possible, closer to Bob's valuation while ensuring he still finds it a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer."
