"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's still lower than my initial offer, but hopefully more appealing to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about $10,300? It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300}

Round 6

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm worried that the negotiations will continue to go down.  John's offer is a solid price and it's time to move on."
