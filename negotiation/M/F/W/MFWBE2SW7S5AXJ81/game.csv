"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential you'll gain from it. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a good compromise considering your initial price and my previous offer. I'm confident this price is fair, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
