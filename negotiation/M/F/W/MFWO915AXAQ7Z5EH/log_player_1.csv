Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,600,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we bring the price down to $600,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a more realistic figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on this. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. To keep this moving, I can do $700,000.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can appreciate the adjustments you've made so far. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal.  If not, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John would net you the full $1,200,000, Bob has now revealed his maximum price of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result than this. Accepting Bob's offer provides a significant profit over your minimum and avoids the risk of failing to close a deal at all."
