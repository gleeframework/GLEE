"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,600,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we bring the price down to $600,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a more realistic figure.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to move down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part while still acknowledging the inherent value we're discussing.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on this. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. To keep this moving, I can do $700,000.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a substantial adjustment and a very competitive offer considering the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can appreciate the adjustments you've made so far. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal.  If not, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
