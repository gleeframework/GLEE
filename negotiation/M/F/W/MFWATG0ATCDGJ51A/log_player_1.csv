"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's somewhat vague (""unique features and potential""), can make the number seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The language emphasizes this is a ""starting point,"" indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to your target, you have ample room for negotiation. You'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bring him closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe my initial offer was already factoring in market value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth and my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Strategically:**  You're lowering your price by $50,000, showing flexibility but not drastically dropping your price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  You're subtly pushing back on Bob's assessment of the market value, reinforcing the product's worth. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By stating your desire for a ""mutually agreeable solution,"" you're emphasizing a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, but his offers are not moving far enough in your direction. You still have rounds to negotiate and should hold firm to aim for a price closer to your minimum. The difference between his offer and your guaranteed sale to John is still substantial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but your offer is still below what I consider acceptable. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  To be clear, the very lowest I can go is $1,020,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a very fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Firm Boundary:** You're explicitly stating your lowest acceptable price ($1,020,000). This signals to Bob that you're serious and there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:**  You're highlighting that this is a significant concession on your part, making Bob more likely to accept it as a ""good deal.""
* **Creating Urgency:**  By emphasizing the ""very lowest"" price, you're subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I can offer $990,000, which is as close to your lowest price as I can afford. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's consistently stuck to a pattern of meeting in the middle and has now explicitly stated his current offer is ""as close to your lowest price as I can afford.""  

Continuing the negotiation with Bob has a low probability of reaching your desired outcome. You risk wasting valuable time and potentially losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
