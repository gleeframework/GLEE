{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Even though Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  Bob is aiming to secure a price closer to Alice's desired $1,200,000 without going too low and risking a deal break."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's original counteroffer. However, Bob's maximum price is $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is still lower than this. Therefore, Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000 and closer to Bob's desired price.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price further. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget."
