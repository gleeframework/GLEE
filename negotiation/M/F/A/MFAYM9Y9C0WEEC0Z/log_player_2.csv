"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $90 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I can definitely negotiate a better deal, especially since I know her minimum acceptable price is $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it."",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to anchor the price significantly lower. While it's unlikely Alice will accept it immediately, it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying, but not at any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To move forward, let's consider a price of $75 for the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $75 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  It's a reasonable step towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we settle on $72 for the transaction? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to negotiate further, $72 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It saves me $28 compared to John's offer and gets me the product within my budget. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation going sour and ending up with the less favorable option."
