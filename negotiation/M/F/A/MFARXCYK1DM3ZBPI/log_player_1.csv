Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:**  This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob. It also makes the offer seem like a good deal for both parties. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  This strategy allows me to potentially earn $100,000 more than my fallback option of selling to John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While there's always a chance Bob will decline, the offer is attractive enough to make it worthwhile for me to try. 
* **Building a relationship:**  Even if Bob declines, a friendly and fair approach could potentially lead to future business opportunities."
