{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It has significant potential for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the ""significant potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specific details.
* **Competitive Price:**  Framing the offer as ""competitive"" can make it seem more appealing.
* **Open Invitation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage and possibly counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, his interest shows potential for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.  

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Interest:** I'm being polite and positive to keep the negotiation open.
* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and makes the counteroffer seem reasonable. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly implying it's worth more than $800,000.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  Emphasizing ""mutually beneficial"" emphasizes a win-win situation, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer $1000000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, there's still room for him to increase his offer.
* **Avoid Settling for Less:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a more secure option than accepting Bob's current offer.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a final counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold. 
* **Strong Language:**  The phrase ""final concession"" implies that this is my last offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price point. 
* **Direct Consequences:** I clearly state the consequence of rejection, which is selling to John. This adds pressure to accept the offer."
