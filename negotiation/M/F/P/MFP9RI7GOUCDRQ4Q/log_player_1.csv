Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high initial price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to try to get a better price, even if it means risking the deal falling through entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but still keep the price significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's still a good profit.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal completely."
