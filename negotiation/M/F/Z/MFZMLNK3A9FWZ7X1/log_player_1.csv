{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $150, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my value of the product."

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. However, it's getting closer. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to his offer, hoping to find a compromise."

I'm lowering my price to $110, which is just above Bob's offer and still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal with Bob."
