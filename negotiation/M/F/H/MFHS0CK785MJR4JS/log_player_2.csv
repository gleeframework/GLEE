# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to achieve Bob's goal."
