"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which would be $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
