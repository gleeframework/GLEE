# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is tempting, you are still very close to your budget limit. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have the option of buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm willing to offer you $87.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  It's a fair compromise and hopefully a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $87.50, which would be $88.75. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88.75 is close to your budget limit, you are still just a few dollars away from your ideal price. It is worth pushing for that last bit of savings, especially since you have a concrete alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $88.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair compromise and a significant reduction from your previous offer.  This would allow me to close the deal with you, and you'd still get a great price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $88. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $89. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering $89, which is closer to your goal but still above your budget.  You've reached the point where you are running out of rounds to negotiate.  It's better to buy from John at $80, as it's a guaranteed deal within your budget.  You can always try to negotiate with Alice again in the future if the opportunity arises."
