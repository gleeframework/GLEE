"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but my absolute maximum I can spend is $8,000.  Are you willing to work with me on that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $9,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $12,000, and I'm not willing to give up more. I'm willing to make one more offer: $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
