Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also gives the impression that the product might be worth even more than $15,000 to others.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest and invite a counter-offer. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable considering the product's worth."
