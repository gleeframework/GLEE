{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price ($1,200,000) and gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a modest counteroffer, increasing Alice's offer by $50,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also signals that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's beneficial to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer to $980,000. This is close to my ideal price, and it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows me to save $20,000."
