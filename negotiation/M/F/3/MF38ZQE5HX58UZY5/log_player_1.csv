Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, aiming slightly above that creates a sense of potential ""deal"" for him.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" we subtly justify the price without directly revealing our minimum.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, furthering the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice (you) can then decide to negotiate further down towards $10,000 or ultimately accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
