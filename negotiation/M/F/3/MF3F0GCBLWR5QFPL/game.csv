"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the potential of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your need for a good price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,290,000.
