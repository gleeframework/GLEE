"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you.  My starting price is $200, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to me.  Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below that, so it makes sense to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price given the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product has value, but $120 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still lower than the $150 I can get from John. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $95 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That way we both get something good out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum price, I still feel there's room for improvement. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can get to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we compromise at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
