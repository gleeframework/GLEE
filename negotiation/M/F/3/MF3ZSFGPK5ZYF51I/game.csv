"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you.  My starting price is $200, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price given the value of this product. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product has value, but $120 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $95 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That way we both get something good out of this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's seal the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we compromise at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
