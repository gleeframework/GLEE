Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, your guaranteed sale, or your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal and might make him suspicious.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of value and urgency.
* **Confidence and Value:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" reinforces Bob's positive perception of the product.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his valuation (enough to be appealing) while netting you a $150,000 profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob.  If a strong future relationship is more valuable than squeezing every dollar, a slightly lower price might be strategic."
