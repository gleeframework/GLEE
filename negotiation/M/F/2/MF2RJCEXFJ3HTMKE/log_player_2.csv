"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $900,000**. This is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Buying from John would cost $1,000,000**. This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $100,000."
