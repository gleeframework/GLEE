{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price as close as possible to his maximum budget.  By offering $10,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to drive the price down further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and it's better to risk another round of negotiation than to commit to a price higher than his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. He is also keeping the price below his maximum budget of $12,000. This counteroffer indicates that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but remains committed to securing a fair price."
