"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you can take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might be able to get the product for closer to $8,000-$9,000."
