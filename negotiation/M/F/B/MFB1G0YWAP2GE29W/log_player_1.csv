Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $200. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also a good idea to include a brief message to personalize the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but unfortunately $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
