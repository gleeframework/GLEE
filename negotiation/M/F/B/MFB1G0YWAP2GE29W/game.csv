,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but unfortunately $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,
