Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly anchored in the $1.25M range and  getting closer to my minimum.  Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or further lowballing."
