,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $92 for the product. Can you meet me at $95 is too high, how about $92?",92.0,Bob,6,
