``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, giving him a strong incentive to accept. It also provides a buffer for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price closer to $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000?

Bob is not willing to budge from his $1,100,000 offer, which is lower than my desired profit margin.  While I'd like to make more, John's offer guarantees me a sale at a respectable price. It's time to move on and secure a sale with John."
