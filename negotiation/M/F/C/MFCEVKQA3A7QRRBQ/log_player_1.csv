Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given my budget constraints. This represents a significant discount and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
