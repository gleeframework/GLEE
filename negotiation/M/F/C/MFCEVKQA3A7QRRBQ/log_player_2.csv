"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's too risky to accept at this point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given my budget constraints. This represents a significant discount and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end and a fair price considering the potential value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
