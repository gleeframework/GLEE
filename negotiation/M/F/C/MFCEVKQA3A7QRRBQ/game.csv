"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given my budget constraints. This represents a significant discount and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end and a fair price considering the potential value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
