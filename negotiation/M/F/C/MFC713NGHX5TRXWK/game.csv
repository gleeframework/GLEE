"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,250,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it will be more than worth it in the long run.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
