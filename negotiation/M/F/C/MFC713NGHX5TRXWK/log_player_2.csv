"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,250,000.
