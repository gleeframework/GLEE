"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Let's start with that price and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding the value of this product. While $2,000,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a middle ground while ensuring a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part and represents a fair price for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
