# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best possible price for him."
