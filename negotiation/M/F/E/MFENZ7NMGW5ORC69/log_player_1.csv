""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential deal.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style, Alice might need to adjust her approach in subsequent interactions."
