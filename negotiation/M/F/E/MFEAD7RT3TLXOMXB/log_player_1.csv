Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the value Bob places on the product ($150). It's worth trying to get closer to that value through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $95? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close to our minimum price, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk.  It's better to secure a sale at $95 than risk getting nothing or having to settle for the lower offer from John."
