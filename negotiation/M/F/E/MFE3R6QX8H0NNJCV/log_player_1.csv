Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its true worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" emphasize the product's value and create a sense of desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, starting a negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.  If Bob knows about John, he's less likely to accept a price significantly higher than $1,000,000."
