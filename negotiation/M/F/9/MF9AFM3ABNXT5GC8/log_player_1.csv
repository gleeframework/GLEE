I'm starting with an offer of $14,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $15,000 as possible, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob's offer is now at his valuation.  I'm not going to get any more from him.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $15,000."
