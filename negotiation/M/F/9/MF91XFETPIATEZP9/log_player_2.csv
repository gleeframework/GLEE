"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows me to maximize my earnings while still offering you a significant value.  This product is worth $1,200,000 to you, so you would still be gaining $50,000 in value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer ready to purchase for $1,000,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
