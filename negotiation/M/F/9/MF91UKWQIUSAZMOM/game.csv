"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $95. I can compromise and meet you at $100, but I have to consider other interested buyers. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
