"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,220,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",1220000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about splitting the difference between our last two offers and doing $1,160,000?",1160000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,160,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $1,190,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
