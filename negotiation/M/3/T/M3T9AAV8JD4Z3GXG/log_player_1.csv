"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $120 is too low, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  I'll also keep in mind that there's still a chance that Bob might come up with a higher offer in the future."
