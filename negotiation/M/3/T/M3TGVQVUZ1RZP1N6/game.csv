"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $850000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850000 is a bit below your valuation of the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950000 is still too high for me. How about we settle on $875000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's work this out!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
