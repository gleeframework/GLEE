"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit below your valuation of the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price even lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle on $875,000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's work this out!"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is still a better price than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $925,000 is the best choice for Bob at this point."
