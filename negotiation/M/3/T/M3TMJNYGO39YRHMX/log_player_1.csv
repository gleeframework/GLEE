Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely, and this price gives me a buffer to work with. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as an alternative buyer at $15,000 provides security and allows me to be more flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $11,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's possible to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **John is a safe fallback:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the leverage to potentially get a better offer from Bob without risking selling at a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $11,000 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 to make this deal work for both of us. Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Still above Bob's value:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000.
* **Remaining flexible:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I am now offering $11,500 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without compromising other financial commitments. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $11,500 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result:**  Bob has stated he can't go higher, and further counteroffers are unlikely to change his mind.
* **John provides a guaranteed higher price:** Selling to John at $15,000 ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who may be unwilling to increase his offer."
