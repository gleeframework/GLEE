Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I consider the product to be worth. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.

Round 6
