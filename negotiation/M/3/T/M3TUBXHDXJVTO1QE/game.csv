"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a significant step for me and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $1,250,000 still isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement in this round and avoid further delays.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's come to an agreement in this round.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,275,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement now.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
