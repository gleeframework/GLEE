"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still leaves plenty of room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is the highest I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $920000 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a little more to $935000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's find common ground.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit below what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which is my final offer.",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $915000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's seal this deal!",925000.0,Alice,7,
