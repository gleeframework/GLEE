# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in this asset. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
