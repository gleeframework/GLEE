Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $100,000 discount from the product's worth to him.
    * We make a $100,000 profit compared to John's offer.
* **Exclusivity:**  By phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we might entice Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
