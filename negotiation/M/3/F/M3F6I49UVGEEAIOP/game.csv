"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $950,000? I think this would be fair for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950,000 is simply too low. It's important for me to receive a fair price for this product. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be more equitable for both parties. Let's aim for that figure.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
