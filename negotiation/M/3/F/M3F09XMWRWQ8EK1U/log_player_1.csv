Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") can encourage a quicker decision from Bob.

**Important Note:** While we want to maximize profit, it's crucial to avoid appearing greedy. The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the high price seem justified."
