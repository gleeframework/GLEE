Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $14000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I want to see if I can push him a little higher before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? I think this is a fair compromise given the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $14,000, but I'm really not comfortable going lower than $14,250.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get even closer to my initial asking price, I've already had a few rounds of back and forth, and it's looking like this is the best deal I'm going to get with Bob.  At $14,100, it's a significant amount more than what I could get from John, so I'm happy to accept it."
