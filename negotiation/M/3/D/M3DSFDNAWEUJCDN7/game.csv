,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $100. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $110, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $115. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the deal. How about we meet at $122?

"I'm surprised by your new offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low.
