"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? This would be a good deal for me while still giving you a significant profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals that you're aiming for a good deal.
* **Significant but not Insulting:**  $1,050,000 is substantially lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a respectable amount that acknowledges the product's value. An extremely low counteroffer might offend Alice and hinder the negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""good deal for me,"" ""significant profit for you"") can make it more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000? This would give you a good price for the product and allow me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to John's price.  There's still room to haggle before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant move from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting this done."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and willingness to compromise. 
* **Substantial Increase:** Moving up to $1,150,000 shows Alice that we're serious about finding an agreement and willing to be flexible. 
* **Highlighting Movement:**  Emphasizing the size of the counteroffer increase can encourage Alice to make a similar concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your previous offer and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to John's price of $1,200,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower. We've successfully gotten Alice to match John's price, so we might as well buy from John and avoid any further back-and-forth."
