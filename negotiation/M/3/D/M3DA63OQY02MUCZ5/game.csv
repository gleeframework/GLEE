"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from what I believe its true value to be.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
