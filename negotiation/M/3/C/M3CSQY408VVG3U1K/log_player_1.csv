Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I want to start with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his valuation, but still potentially higher than what John offers. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a risk Bob will reject a high offer. However, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely.

This strategy aims to balance risk and reward by seeking the highest possible price from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
