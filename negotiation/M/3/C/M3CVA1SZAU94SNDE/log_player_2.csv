``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000.**  This is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **John's price is $1,200,000.**  This is your maximum budget, but Alice's offer is lower.
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save the most money."
