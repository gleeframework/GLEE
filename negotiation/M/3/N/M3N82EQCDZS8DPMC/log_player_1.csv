Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $175 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $175 is still above your minimum selling price, ensuring you make a profit.

This allows for a negotiation while still giving you the opportunity to secure your minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum price of $150.  While I could accept it, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit at this point.  It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** This counteroffer allows me to meet my minimum price of $150, ensuring I don't take a loss.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $150 is a reasonable compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate and frames the price as a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, it seems like Bob is not willing to go much higher.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
