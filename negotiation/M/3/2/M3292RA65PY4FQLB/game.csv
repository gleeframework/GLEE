"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,5,
