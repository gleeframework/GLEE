Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and the time sensitivity of the offer to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $2,000,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This could work in your favor.
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If a strong relationship is important, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower."
