"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent price, it's still far from the value Bob places on the product ($150). I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I'm still not quite there at $110.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $80 and closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
