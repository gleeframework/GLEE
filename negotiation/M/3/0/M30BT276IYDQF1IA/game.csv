"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $975,000.  Would that work for you?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'd be willing to meet you at $1,000,000.  That's a firm offer, but I think it's fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
