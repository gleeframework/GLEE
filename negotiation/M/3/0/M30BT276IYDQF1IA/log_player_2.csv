Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000.

It's time to walk away. Alice is not moving towards your price target.  She rejected your firm offer at $1,000,000 and is now trying to increase the price again. It's unlikely she'll go much lower and you're better off taking John's offer of $1,200,000 at this point."
