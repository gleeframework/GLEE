"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Value to Alice:** $80

Since Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, it's a good deal for Bob. While Bob could get it from John for $120, accepting Alice's offer saves him $10."
