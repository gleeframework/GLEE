{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,199,999. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) sets a strong anchor. It might encourage Bob to negotiate around a higher number.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing I have another buyer, there's an implied urgency for Bob to act quickly.

While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, the potential gain of nearly $400,000 over his perceived value makes it a risk worth taking. If he rejects it, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
