"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its fair market value is around $15,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. 
* There's no reason to pay more than necessary. Buying from John saves you the most money."
