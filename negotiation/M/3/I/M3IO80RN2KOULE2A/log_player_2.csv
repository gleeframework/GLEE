Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I can meet you halfway at $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's the absolute lowest I can go.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still slightly higher than I'm willing to pay.  Could you consider $12,900 as a final compromise?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,050, but that's the final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,050

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have only one round left. Alice is not budging, and it's unlikely she will come down to your desired price. It's better to buy the product from John for $15,000 to avoid further negotiations and potential deal-breaking."
