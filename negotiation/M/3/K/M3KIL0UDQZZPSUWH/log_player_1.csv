Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
