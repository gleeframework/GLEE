Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a premium price acknowledges the potential for a quicker sale than waiting for John.

**Important:**  This assumes Alice doesn't know for sure that Bob values the product at $15,000. If she had that information, she'd obviously offer it at $14,999 to maximize her profit."
