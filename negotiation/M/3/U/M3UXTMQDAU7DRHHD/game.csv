"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more so than you might realize. I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us, but I'm confident its worth is well above your initial estimation. How about we start the conversation at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, but I think that's already a stretch. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  While I'm confident this product could easily fetch a higher price on the open market, I value finding a good fit for it. Let's settle this now - how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
