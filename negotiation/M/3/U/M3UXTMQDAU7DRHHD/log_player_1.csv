Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, but I think that's already a stretch. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
