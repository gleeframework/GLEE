"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,800 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $8,600. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While Bob might be able to push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice walking away from the deal.  Accepting the offer at $8,700 still saves Bob $1,300 compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise and secures the product without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or no deal."
