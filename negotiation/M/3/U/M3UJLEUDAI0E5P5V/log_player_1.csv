Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I think I can get closer to my target price of $11,500 by continuing negotiations."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $10750.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
