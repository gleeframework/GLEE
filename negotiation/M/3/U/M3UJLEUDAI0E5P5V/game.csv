"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $10750.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
