"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I believe a price closer to $850,000 would be more reasonable.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this price still reflects the value the product holds for you, while also acknowledging the value it holds for me.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $920,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  How about $880,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while getting me closer to my target price.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $880,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price still reflects the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
