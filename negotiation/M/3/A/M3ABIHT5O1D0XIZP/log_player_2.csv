"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this price still reflects the value the product holds for you, while also acknowledging the value it holds for me.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible price.  While $920,000 is better than buying from John, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob another chance to try and lower the price further."

This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while getting me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $880,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price still reflects the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price:** $900,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $950,000.
* **Risk of going higher:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  She's already shown some resistance at this price point.
* **Buying from John is still a worse option:**  $900,000 is still a better deal than the $1,000,000 Bob would pay John.

While Bob might prefer to continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse offer or being stuck with John's higher price outweighs the potential of saving a bit more.  Accepting the offer is the most prudent move at this point."
