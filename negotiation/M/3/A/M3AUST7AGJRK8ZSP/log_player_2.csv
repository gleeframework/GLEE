"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower.  You have 10 rounds and a fallback option at $100, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by $10.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is a good price considering my goal is to spend no more than $100.  Accepting this offer saves me $25 compared to buying from John. There's always a chance I could get it lower, but the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it at this point."
