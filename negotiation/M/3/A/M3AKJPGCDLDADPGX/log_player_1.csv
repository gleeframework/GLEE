Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $15,000 is a significant starting point, but not unreasonable if the product is truly valuable.  It allows for negotiation room while still representing a good profit for you.
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know your thoughts!"", you're opening the door for Bob to counteroffer, which is essential for maximizing your earnings.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Your next offer will depend on Bob's response and your understanding of his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be happy to purchase it for $12000.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** You want to maximize your profit. Selling to John for $10,000 is the absolute minimum, and Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer but still below your desired range.
* **Negotiation:** While $12,000 is tempting, you have room to negotiate further with Bob. You're confident in the product's value and believe you can secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer. This demonstrates your confidence in the product's worth and allows for further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm aiming for.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet halfway, suggesting a genuine desire for a deal.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the benefit of the offer for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to engage further, potentially leading to a faster resolution.

**Note:**  This counteroffer is still significantly higher than John's offer.  Depending on Bob's response, you may need to adjust your strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $13,000 is only $500 away from your initial offer of $13,500. 
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, especially since he seems firm on his price.
* **Profit:** $13,000 is a substantial profit and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.

**Conclusion:**

While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the potential for further negotiation is diminishing. Accepting Bob's offer is a safe and profitable choice."
