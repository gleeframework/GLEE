"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be happy to purchase it for $12000.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still quite a bit below what I'm aiming for.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $13500?  It's a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
