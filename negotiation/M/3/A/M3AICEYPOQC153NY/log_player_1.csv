Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product.  This is still a great price for you, considering its value, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500, as I mentioned earlier, but I can also consider $10,000. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000 and is close to my target price.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price with continued negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
