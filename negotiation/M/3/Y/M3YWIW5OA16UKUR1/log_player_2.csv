"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiating further if you'd like. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, taking into account the value to both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
