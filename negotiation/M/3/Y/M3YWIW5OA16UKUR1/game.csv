"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiating further if you'd like. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  I understand it's valuable to you, but I believe this offer is fair considering the potential value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, taking into account the value to both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firmly committed to my maximum offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,
