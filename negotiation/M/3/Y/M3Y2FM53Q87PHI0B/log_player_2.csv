{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $50. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget. I'm hoping to spark a negotiation and find a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer of $100 is my maximum limit. I'll accept it to secure the product."
