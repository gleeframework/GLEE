{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is closer to my value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I allow for Bob to potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum value, giving me the leverage to end the negotiation if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better counter-offer:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Knowing that I have John willing to pay my minimum value gives me the confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering within a reasonable range:** I'm not going down to Bob's offer but am willing to compromise by decreasing my price to $1,450,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still safeguarding my minimum value.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that this price remains fair.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I frame the counter-offer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement, suggesting a positive outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I must adhere to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the product's value and my financial constraints. I look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob lowering his offer further, potentially below my minimum.
* **Securing a deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal to a further negotiation or having to sell to John for a slightly lower price."
