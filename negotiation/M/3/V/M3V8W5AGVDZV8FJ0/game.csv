,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? It's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider this revised offer?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $108.50. This way we both get a good deal.",108.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $108.50. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
