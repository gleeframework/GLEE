# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your effort to reach a mutual agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to budge below $9,200. While we could continue negotiating, we're running the risk of the price remaining higher than John's offer. At this point, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
