"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our current offers. Can you consider a price of $10250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10250. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
