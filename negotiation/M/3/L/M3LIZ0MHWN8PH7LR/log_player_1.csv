I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$7,000 is way too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum value for the product.  If Bob is serious about buying, he'll come up from $7,000.  If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$9,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $11,000 is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping this is close enough to get him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've negotiated with Bob for a while, and it seems we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm confident that John will buy my product for a fair price.  I'm going to sell to John."
