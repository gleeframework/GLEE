"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that has been carefully crafted to meet your needs. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm only able to offer $100.  I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your position, I would like to propose an alternative. Given the value of the product, I am willing to consider a price closer to $130. This still allows us to maintain a fair margin while accommodating your budget. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $130 is closer, it's still slightly above my limit.  Let's meet in the middle at $115. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
