"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is a step closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and Bob has already made several counteroffers.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go lower.  While $815,000 is still a significant amount of money, it's the best deal Bob can get from Alice.  If he rejects, he risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
