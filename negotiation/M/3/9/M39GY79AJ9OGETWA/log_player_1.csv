Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
