Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I haven't reached my minimum price yet, so I'm open to negotiation but also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it indicates he's still interested. This gives me an opportunity to counter and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer if it's not in my best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000.
* **Fair price:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. This makes it a more reasonable compromise.
* **Positive framing:** The message is encouraging and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for Bob. 
* **Avoiding a deadlock:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation moving and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $9,800, and that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,800 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price and a higher profit. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and move on."
