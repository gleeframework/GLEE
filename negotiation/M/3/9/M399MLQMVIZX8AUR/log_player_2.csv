"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. After careful consideration and evaluation, we believe this product would be a perfect fit for your needs and expectations. We are offering it to you at a special price of $1,350,000, which we believe is a fair compromise between its value to us and its perceived value to you. This offer is valid for a limited time, so please let us know if you are interested in proceeding with the purchase. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
