"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but closer to $600,000 would make more sense for my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This product is truly worth more, and I believe it will generate significant value for you.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits for you. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $750,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  It's a fair compromise considering John is offering me a similar product at a lower price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, as a final compromise. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant concession on my part. If you're truly interested, I believe this is the last opportunity to make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
