"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:**  I'm starting with a high price,  knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth, which could encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), giving me room to negotiate if needed. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm starting with a high offer, I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, which provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but closer to $600,000 would make more sense for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates that he is still interested.  This means there's room for negotiation. I can likely secure a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It shows him I'm serious about getting a fair price and signals that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next steps:**  In the next round, I'll counter-offer with a price that's more in line with my minimum acceptable price and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This product is truly worth more, and I believe it will generate significant value for you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to nudge him closer to my price.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the idea of finding ""common ground"" to make the negotiation feel collaborative rather than adversarial.

**Important Note:** By offering $900,000, I'm hoping to bridge the gap between our offers. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will have to decide whether to lower my price further or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Limited room for compromise:**  While I've already lowered my price once, Bob's offer is still far from my price point. There's a considerable gap to bridge, and I need to maintain some leverage. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob's increased offer suggests he's still interested and willing to negotiate.  It's possible he might be persuaded to offer more, especially if I stand firm.

**Next steps:**  I'll need to carefully assess the remaining rounds and the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer further. If I feel the negotiation isn't moving in a favorable direction, I'll strongly consider selling to John to guarantee my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's latest offer ($700,000).  This signals a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.  This helps to justify my price and could sway him toward accepting.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to secure my desired outcome. However, there's still a chance that Bob will see the value in my offer and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $750,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  It's a fair compromise considering John is offering me a similar product at a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $800,000 that I deem the product worth to me. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob's statement about John's offer suggests he might not be willing to go higher.  I need to weigh this against the remaining rounds. 
* **Possible for a higher offer:**  There's still a chance that Bob might be willing to budge a bit more, especially if I reject his offer.  

**Next Steps:**  With only four rounds left, I need to carefully consider the risk/reward.  If I sell to John, I guarantee my minimum price. If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might increase his offer, but also a chance that he might walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, as a final compromise. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant concession on my part. If you're truly interested, I believe this is the last opportunity to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final, significant concession, coming closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price higher than my minimum.  
* **Urgency and Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer, creating a sense of urgency to push Bob towards a decision.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I reiterate the value of the product, hoping to remind Bob of its worth and potentially sway his decision.

**Important Note:** With only three rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by pushing for a higher price. This is a significant compromise for me, but I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value and is willing to meet me in the middle.  If this fails, I'll likely have to accept the $1,000,000 offer from John in the next round."
