"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's potential to negotiate further and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is also well within Bob's budget, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is always looking to save money, Alice's counteroffer of $11,800 is getting closer to his ideal price.  He's already made a counteroffer, and it's possible that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price from Alice. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within his budget and saves him the risk of getting stuck with a more expensive deal from John."
