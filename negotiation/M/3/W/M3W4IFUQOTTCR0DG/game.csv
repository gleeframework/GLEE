"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity.
