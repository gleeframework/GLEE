"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a positive message to emphasize the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price, which allows for a back-and-forth negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** Remember that John's offer of $1,500,000 is a safety net. I can walk away from the deal with Bob if he becomes too unreasonable.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to ensure Bob doesn't feel pressured into accepting an unfair price. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses to find the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  I have 9 rounds remaining, and Bob has shown interest.  This gives me space to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer provides leverage.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 strengthens my position during the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value, but still within a reasonable range for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm adjusting my price downwards to demonstrate flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.  $1,600,000 is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal but also reflects the product's worth.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not going to drop too low too quickly.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive Language:**  My message is still polite and encouraging, emphasizing the potential for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I will continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. 
* I will keep in mind John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's moved closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation continues.**  I still have 6 rounds remaining and John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safety net. 
* **Finding a compromise:**  I need to find a price point that both Bob and I can agree on. I'll need to carefully consider how much further I can lower my price without compromising too much.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* I will continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my counteroffers accordingly.
* I will keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm proposing $1,400,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum.  This shows flexibility and willingness to find common ground.
* **High-Pressure Move:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a deal and using language like ""bridge the gap"" and ""get this deal done"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,400,000 is still a good price for me and allows me to get closer to my desired profit while remaining within a reasonable range.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully watch Bob's response to this offer.
* If he rejects it again, I might consider lowering my price slightly further.
* If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good deal within the 10-round limit.
* If the negotiations continue, I'll still have John's offer as a safety net."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my final offer. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **We're getting close to the deadline.**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and consider the potential for John's offer.
* **Counteroffering is still a possibility.**  I can try to find a compromise within the remaining rounds, but I need to be mindful of the time constraint.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still within a range that might entice him to accept.
* I will carefully assess Bob's response and consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiations or if it's better to move on to John's offer.
* I will be mindful of the remaining rounds and aim to find a resolution that maximizes my profit within the time limit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,250,000 is just too low for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000 as a final concession. This is the best I can do. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000, which is still above my minimum of $1,500,000 but shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need for a final decision by using phrases like ""final concession"" and ""close this deal now."" This adds pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity.
* **Balancing Risks:** I'm still within a range where I can make a reasonable profit, but also keeping in mind the time constraint and John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* This is my final offer.  If Bob rejects it, I will move on to John's offer.
* I'm aware of the limited time and need to make a decision that maximizes my profit while also considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000, but that's my final offer. If I don't get that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is still too low.**  $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is running out.**  With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can reach a better deal with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a secure alternative.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Decision:** It's time to move on to the sure thing. I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I achieve my minimum profit goal."
