"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget.  However, it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you might be able to get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,080,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still outside of your budget. While it's a good deal compared to her initial offer, you've already made a counteroffer that Alice rejected, and it seems unlikely she will go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees you the product at your maximum price point and avoids further negotiation."
