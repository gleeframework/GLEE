"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is a significant discount, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Bob can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still remaining within a reasonable price range. It's a bold move, but if successful, it could lead to a faster closing of the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise.  It's a $50,000 reduction from her previous offer and only $250,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John and allows for a quicker closing."
