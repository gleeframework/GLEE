"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
