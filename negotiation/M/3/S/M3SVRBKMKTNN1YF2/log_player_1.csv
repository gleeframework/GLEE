Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price. This allows her to start with a significantly higher offer. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" Alice provides a reason for the high price, even if it's a bit vague. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. Alice can then strategically lower the price while still aiming to secure a deal significantly above her minimum.
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything. She can proceed with selling to John at her desired minimum price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** While not provided in the prompt, understanding the typical negotiation norms in their industry would be beneficial for Alice.
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she can adjust her approach accordingly."
