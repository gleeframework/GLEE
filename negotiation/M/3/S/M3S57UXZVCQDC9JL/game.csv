"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $500,000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,
