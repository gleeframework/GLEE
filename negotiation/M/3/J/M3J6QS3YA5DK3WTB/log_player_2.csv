{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to you.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save more money."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm ready to accept. There's still room for further negotiation, and I want to see if she's willing to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push with this counteroffer. It's at the upper limit of my acceptable range and matches what the product is worth to Alice. I'm hoping this will convince her to close the deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John, as it's unlikely she'll come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price point, and we're approaching the latter stages of the negotiation. With only three rounds left, it's highly unlikely that I'll be able to get a lower price. It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product rather than risk losing it and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
