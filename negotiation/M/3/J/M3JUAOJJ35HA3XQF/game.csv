"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to bridge the gap.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for adjusting your offer.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to make one final offer of $1,025,000. It's the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you pushing for a fair deal, and $1,025,000 is closer than before.  However, to make this work for me, I need to be at $1,050,000. This is a final compromise from my side, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
