"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $87? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",87.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we settle on $88? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",88.0,Alice,5,
