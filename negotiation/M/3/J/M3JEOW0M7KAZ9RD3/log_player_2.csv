"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It aligns perfectly with your current needs and has the potential to significantly enhance your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000, reflecting its true worth. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire an asset that could be a game-changer for your operations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, you maintain the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or even find a better deal elsewhere."
