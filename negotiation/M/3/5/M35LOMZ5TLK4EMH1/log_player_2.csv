"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price.  It's worth negotiating to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However,  $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me,  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  It's also worth noting that John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price, so Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
