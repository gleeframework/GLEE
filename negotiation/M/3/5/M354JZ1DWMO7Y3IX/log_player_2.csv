{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her value of $100.
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a significant amount of money.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

* This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.
*  I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm aiming for a price closer to my $100 limit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

* Alice is not budging much, so I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount.
* This shows her that I'm willing to compromise, but still holding firm on my desired price range.
* With only 4 rounds left, I need to start considering the possibility of going with John, but I'm hoping Alice will meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still higher than my ideal price point. 
* I'm not willing to accept it yet, as I still have 3 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.
* I have already lost a lot of rounds with counteroffers, but I can't afford to give up yet."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer to $120, which is now in line with Alice's first offer.
* This shows a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my commitment to closing the deal. 
* With only two rounds left, this is likely my last chance to get Alice to accept, especially if she's willing to meet me halfway. 
* While I'd prefer a lower price, the risk of going to John for $150 is becoming more significant with each round."
