"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and still a great deal for you. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your revised offer of $1,100,000. However, I believe we can find common ground. How about $1,050,000? This would allow us to move forward while still respecting the value I place on the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
