"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800.

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm comfortable going up to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,600. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",9600.0,Alice,5,
