"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows for a good profit margin for you and is still within my acceptable range. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering $1,150,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and would still allow you to make a significant profit.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that we can both be happy with.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is the highest I can go and still make a profit. Can you consider my offer?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
