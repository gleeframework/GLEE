Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows for a good profit margin for you and is still within my acceptable range. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering $1,150,000.
