"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  $15,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves potential for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is still higher than Bob's offer but a significant step down from my initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject the offer again. There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, and I'd like to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is only $1,000 more than Bob's last offer and shows I'm flexible. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  it seems like we're getting stuck in a pattern.  I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
