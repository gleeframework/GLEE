"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $140 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
