"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  It's a fair markup considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm holding out for a better price.  $90 is below my minimum of $100.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $105. It's a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm still aiming to get a profit, but I'm showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is the best I've received so far. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
