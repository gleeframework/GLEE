Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 aims to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000).  
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.

**Why this strategy is better than others:**

* **Offering below $14,000:** While you could offer it for less, you risk leaving money on the table. Bob is likely willing to pay a premium.
* **Offering at or above $15,000:** Bob is unlikely to accept, and you'll have to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
