{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $135 is higher than your minimum but leaves space for Bob to bargain.
* **Shows you're serious about selling to him:** A starting offer demonstrates your willingness to work with Bob. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $125 is closer but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget.  Would you do $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more than $120,  Bob is clearly pushing for a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves further negotiation time."
