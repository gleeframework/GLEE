"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and allows me to earn a good profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my need to ensure a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $925,000. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
