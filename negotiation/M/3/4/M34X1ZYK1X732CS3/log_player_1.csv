Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $6,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. Can we discuss a price of $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we perhaps agree on $7,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.
