"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
