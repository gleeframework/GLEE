# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 8

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at the final round of negotiations, and Alice is unwilling to go below $1,000,000. I've already made my final offer and it was rejected.  While I'd prefer to get a better deal, the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000, even though it's not my ideal price."
