"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a way to make this work.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $150, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
