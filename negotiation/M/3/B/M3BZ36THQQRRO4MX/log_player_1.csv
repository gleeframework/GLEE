Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, justifying the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he's very interested, potentially landing a price even higher than $1,500,000.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, or negotiates down to a price still higher than $1,200,000."
