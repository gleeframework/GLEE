"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,750?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
