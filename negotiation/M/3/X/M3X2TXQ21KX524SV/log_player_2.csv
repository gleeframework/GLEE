"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, considering it's worth more to me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above my budget of $80, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's a better deal than buying from John for $80. There's a chance I could negotiate further, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting Alice's offer minimizes risk and gets me the product."
