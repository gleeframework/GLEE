Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting price that is significantly higher than your minimum value ($15,000). This allows for room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is based on the following principles:

* **Start high:**  A higher starting price gives you more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Leave room for compromise:** The initial price is not your final price. It allows for a potential decrease to a mutually agreeable price point.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the potential benefits of the product to Bob, which can influence his perception of its value.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, the deal is closed.
* If Bob rejects the offer, we will need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new price.
* If the negotiation stalls, we have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I can only afford to pay up to $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum price we are willing to accept. It's better to accept his offer than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for the same price.  While we could try to counter-offer, it's likely that Bob will stand firm at $15,000.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is our minimum goal.
* **Negotiation Time:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing Bob and potentially having to sell to John, which would take more time and effort.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Even if we counter-offer, there is no guarantee Bob will accept, and we might end up with the same outcome as selling to John. 

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible and efficient option in this scenario.**"
