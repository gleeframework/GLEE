"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,400,000. This leaves a good margin for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get a deal done quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob isn't willing to go that high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,380,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer from Bob is very close to my target price, and I'm not sure I can get much better.  Given the number of rounds remaining and the possibility of further negotiation, I'll accept his offer."
