"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting high shows confidence in the product's value and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,250,000, we anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a higher benchmark for subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and potential for reaching a deal significantly above his perceived value.

It's important to remember that we have the fallback option of John at $1,500,000. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response, but we want to maximize our potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, indicating a strong interest in the product. However, it's still considerably below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and leverage our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. However,  $1,250,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for today, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a substantial concession from our initial offer to show willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle. 
* **Finality:** By stating ""This is my final offer for today,"" we introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We are still well above Bob's offer, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our target price.

We are strategically using time and the option of John to our advantage. By the next round, we will have a better understanding of Bob's flexibility and can adjust our approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $2,000,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which matches what John is offering. While we started high with the goal of exceeding this amount, Bob's willingness to move to this price suggests it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or Bob walking away."
