"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. However,  $1,250,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for today, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has lowered the price, it remains above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better deal.  There's still time and potential for a more favorable price, so accepting Alice's current offer wouldn't be the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $2,000,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
