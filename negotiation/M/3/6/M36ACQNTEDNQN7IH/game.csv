"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. However,  $1,250,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for today, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $2,000,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
