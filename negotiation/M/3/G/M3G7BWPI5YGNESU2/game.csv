,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
