Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to allow for some negotiation room.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing its usefulness. This might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by saying ""Let me know what you think!"".  

This approach allows for a possible compromise while still aiming to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While it's tempting to take $90, it's below my minimum threshold of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **John as a backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and can explore a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $100, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation going.

This counteroffer maintains a price above my minimum threshold while staying within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiation costs.

While I'd prefer to sell for $100 or higher, the potential of losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for $120 makes accepting his offer the most rational decision."
