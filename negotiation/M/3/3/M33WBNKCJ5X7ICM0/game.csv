"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $13,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
