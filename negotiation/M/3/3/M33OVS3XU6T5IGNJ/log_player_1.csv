Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if it goes to the broader market (""before I list it publicly"").
* **Clean and Direct:** The message is straightforward, avoiding overly aggressive sales tactics.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she can afford to aim higher with Bob."
