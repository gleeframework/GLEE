"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price considering I'm a serious buyer and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at that price. ",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.  Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,6,
