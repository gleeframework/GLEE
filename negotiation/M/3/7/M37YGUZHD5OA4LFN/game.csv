"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it for $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 undervalues the product significantly. I can be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a very fair offer considering the value this product brings.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still think $12,500 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
