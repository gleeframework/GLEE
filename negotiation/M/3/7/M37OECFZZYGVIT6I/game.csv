"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price point?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
