"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
