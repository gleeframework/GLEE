Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $15,000.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. This can make Bob more receptive to a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $19,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a premium if the product is unique or hard to find elsewhere. 
* **Market Dynamics:** The message doesn't mention other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob."
