"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I'm confident it's a fantastic opportunity for your company, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I expect to get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and aligns with my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 doesn't reflect the significant value this product offers.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still ensuring a fair return for my investment.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional concession - I'll also consider paying a 5% premium to cover any potential risks associated with the product. This would bring the total price to $1,122,500. Is this a more acceptable offer for you?",1122500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. $1,122,500 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking for this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair return for my investment. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a considerable reduction from my previous offer.  This allows for a profitable deal for both of us, while still acknowledging the product's significant value. ",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still struggling to get to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to move forward with this offer.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're running out of time here. While I appreciate your position, $1,180,000 is simply too low. Let's make one final attempt to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000, which is a small concession but reflects the urgency of the situation. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1190000.0,Alice,9,
