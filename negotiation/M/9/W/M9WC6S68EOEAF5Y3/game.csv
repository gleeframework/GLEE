"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $1,300,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this brings, but $1,300,000 is still out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $1,200,000. This price is still within my desired range and is a good compromise.  Let's close this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
