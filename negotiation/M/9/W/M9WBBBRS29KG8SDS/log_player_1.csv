"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting at a high price, but still below Bob's perceived value. 
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob to make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I've left room for negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially counter without me feeling pressured to immediately drop the price. 
* **Protecting my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is well above my minimum threshold of $800,000, giving me some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort in selling the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $900,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is willing to pay more than John, there's still room for me to increase the price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 more rounds to work with Bob, giving me time to negotiate a better deal. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and moving to the next round to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:** $1,000,000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  My message focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us, making me appear more cooperative.
* **Maintain negotiating power:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we aim for $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I've only had 4 rounds, and there's still time to get a better offer from Bob.
* **Risk of losing to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and going to counter with a price closer to my ideal deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** This offer is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:** I'm framing this price as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially pushing him to agree.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** This is only my 5th round, and I want to maintain pressure on Bob to increase his offer.

I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Close to my minimum:**  However, this is very close to my minimum, and it's possible I could reach a deal in the next few rounds.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I'm hoping to get a higher price, but only if I can get close to my minimum.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and going to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to close the deal and avoid having to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $965,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** This offer is only $5,000 higher than Bob's last offer, showing I'm ready to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to ""close the deal,"" creating a sense of urgency to encourage acceptance.

While I'm still below my ideal price, I'm hoping this offer is enough to convince Bob and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $965000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $955000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $955,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but only by a small margin.
* **Limited time:** We're down to the last 3 rounds, and there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is very close to what I could potentially get from Bob.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and being left with nothing outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000."
