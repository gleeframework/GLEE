Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000.  I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at $11,000 gives him a potential ""deal"" while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, starting slightly higher leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

By setting the initial price at $11,000, I aim to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing my potential profit."
