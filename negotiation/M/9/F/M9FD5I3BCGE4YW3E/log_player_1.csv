Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

I'm starting the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $120 is a decent offer, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

I'm aiming to meet Bob closer to the middle ground while still staying above his initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's unlikely the difference would be significant. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
