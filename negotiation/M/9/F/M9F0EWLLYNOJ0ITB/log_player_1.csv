"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left room for Bob to counteroffer, as I know the price is likely negotiable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm unlikely to go below $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I need to be mindful of the 10-round limit and try to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it demonstrates that he's willing to negotiate. I can potentially close a deal with him at a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that meets my minimum requirements while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $10,000 is a good price, I'm still looking for a little more to make this work for me. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $11,000, he's getting a great deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and open to further discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $8,000, making it a better deal than selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have 7 rounds left, so I still have some time to negotiate but need to move towards a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 above my minimum price of $8,000. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at such a low margin.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that is closer to my desired price while remaining within the realm of what Bob might be willing to accept."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a little more to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer of $9,500 and my previous offer of $11,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise and reach a solution.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair deal"" for both of us. This plays on the principle of reciprocity and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **Open-ended Question:** Ending with an open-ended question like ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** This offer is still higher than John's offer, making it more beneficial to sell to Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $10500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. Selling at this price would result in a loss for me. 
* **Limited Rounds:** While I have 4 rounds left, I'm not willing to risk accepting an offer that's below my minimum, especially when I have John as a backup option.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a significant concession, but I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my final concession, bringing the price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing this as a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a fair solution.
* **Confidence in Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he's getting even at this price point.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Rounds:** I have only 3 rounds left, so this needs to be a strong offer.
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm not keen on selling to John, this offer is getting dangerously close to that price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is still only $200 above my minimum price of $8,000. This is a very small margin and not worth the risk. 
* **Limited Rounds:** I only have 2 rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will move much closer to my desired price in this time.
* **John's Offer:** Given the circumstances, selling to John for $8,000 is a safer and more predictable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing more time and getting a worse offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer to ensure I don't end up selling at a price that's too low."
