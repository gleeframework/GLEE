Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below the guaranteed $15,000 allows for potential negotiation with Bob.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth, subtly justifying the high price. 

This strategy attempts to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still leaving Alice with a profit if Bob rejects the offer."
