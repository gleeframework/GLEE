Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he isn't, I can always work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $13,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise a bit. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is refusing to budge on his price. I've already lowered my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum, but it's clear that he's not willing to pay more. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better outcome, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get a price that meets my minimum and avoids further wasted time with Bob."
