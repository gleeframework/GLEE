Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message focuses on the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price. The goal is to frame it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:**  By highlighting ""exclusive opportunity,"" you aim to appeal to Bob's desire for something unique and potentially increase his perceived value of the product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  This strategy assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium for something he highly values. If Bob is very price-sensitive, a lower starting offer might be more effective.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the advantage of a backup buyer, but you also don't want to price yourself out of a potentially higher sale."
