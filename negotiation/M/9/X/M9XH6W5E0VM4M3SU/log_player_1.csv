Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed sale price ($15,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. The price is still significantly higher than his perceived value ($12,000), giving me room for negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""opportunity"" and potential ""benefit"" for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. If Bob rejects it, I have the option to negotiate further or proceed with selling to John."
