{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, which could encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I would like to receive, but it's still above my minimum price of $10,000. I'm not ready to sell at this price yet. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $13,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves room for a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $11,500, that's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum price of $10,000, and I'm not sure how much lower he's willing to go.  I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal."
