Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the product's value to both potential buyers while prioritizing the highest potential profit for Alice."
