"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1,350,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, and I'm happy to continue discussing a price that works for both of us.  However, $1,350,000 is quite a bit lower than my initial offer. Would you consider $1,400,000?  This compromise would still give you a good deal, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue discussing a price that's mutually beneficial.  $1,375,000 is a step closer to my ideal outcome.  However, to make this deal truly work for me, I'd need to be at $1,390,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still ensuring a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground on this final price point.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
