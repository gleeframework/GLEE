Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,200,000.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my ideal range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is tempting, I still believe I can push for a bit more. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Your offer of $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $1,260,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a bit closer to $1,275,000, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $1,260,000 is still a good price, and I'm happy with the outcome."
