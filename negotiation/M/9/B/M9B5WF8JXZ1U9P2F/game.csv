"Alice, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 represents a fair valuation of its worth, I understand your position. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
