Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower.  Here's why:

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ensures you get the best possible outcome.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, Bob might be willing to negotiate upwards if he's very interested.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering a lower price might make Bob think you're desperate to sell and could encourage him to lowball you further. 

While it's possible Bob might reject the offer at $10,000, you're guaranteed that amount from John, making this the optimal starting point."
