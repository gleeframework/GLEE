"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that the transaction remains beneficial for both parties. Therefore, I propose a price of $9000 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
