"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $125.  I'm confident that's a fair price that we can both agree on.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $135? I'm trying to make a profit here, after all!",135.0,Alice,5,
