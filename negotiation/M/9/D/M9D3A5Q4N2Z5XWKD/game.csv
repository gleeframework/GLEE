,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the sale. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, while also considering your willingness to negotiate.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is a fair price that I believe is closer to your last offer, but still takes into account the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  While $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit lower to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value while also reflecting my budget. I believe this is a good compromise and a fair deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
