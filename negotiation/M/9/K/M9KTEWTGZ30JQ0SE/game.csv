"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's find common ground to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but I'll also throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is a unique opportunity to get a top-notch product with added value. I'm willing to hold firm at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
