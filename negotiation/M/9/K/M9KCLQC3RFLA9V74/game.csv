"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable going up to $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $105. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
