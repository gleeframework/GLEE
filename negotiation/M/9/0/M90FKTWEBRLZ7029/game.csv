"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $14000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $17000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $15500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",15500.0,Bob,4,
