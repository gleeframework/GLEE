"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll love the product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105, which would be $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
