"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I want to start with a strong anchor point.  $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above both our valuations.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I don't want to scare Bob off with an overly aggressive first offer. By expressing openness to discussion, I encourage him to counter and engage in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option (John):**  I have a strong fallback position with John, giving me leverage to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Above His Valuation:**  Bob offering $900,000 indicates he's willing to go above his initial perceived value of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Leveraging John:** My ability to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a strong position to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've come down from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is substantial enough to demonstrate seriousness.
* **Above My Minimum:** The $1,150,000 price point keeps me comfortably above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable deal.
* **Maintaining Value:** My message emphasizes the product's inherent value, subtly pushing back on Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation closer to his initial offer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With several rounds remaining, I have the luxury of time to engage in a back-and-forth to secure the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000, securing a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could push for more, Bob has shown a willingness to move substantially from his initial offer. This indicates he's serious and values the product.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now, rather than risking further negotiation, allows me to realize the profit sooner. There's always a chance Bob could lower his offer in subsequent rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting a strong offer minimizes uncertainty."
