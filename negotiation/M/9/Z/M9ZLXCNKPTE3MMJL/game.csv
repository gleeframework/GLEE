"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me starting out. Could we do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is where I see the value of this product right now.  If you're willing to work in that range, I think we can get a deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
