"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
