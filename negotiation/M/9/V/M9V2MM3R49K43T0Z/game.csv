"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring convenience to your life. Given its unique features and quality, I believe it's worth more than $80. Would you like to purchase it for this special introductory price?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $80 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
