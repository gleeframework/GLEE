{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob has shown that he's not willing to budge on his price, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  $8,000 is my minimum and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
