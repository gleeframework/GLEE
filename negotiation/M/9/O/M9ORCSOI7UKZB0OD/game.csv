"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? This would be a fair price for both parties.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute limit. Let's make a deal and close this out.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $15,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $15,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",15200.0,Alice,7,
