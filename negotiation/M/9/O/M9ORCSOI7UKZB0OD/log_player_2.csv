"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $12,000. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way too high.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? This would be a fair price for both parties."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He can either try to counteroffer again or consider the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute limit. Let's make a deal and close this out."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $15,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $15,200, which is closer to Bob's target price.  However, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $12,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, and Bob is running out of time.  It's important to make a decision that's in Bob's best interest, and buying from John ensures that he gets the product for the best possible price within his budget."
