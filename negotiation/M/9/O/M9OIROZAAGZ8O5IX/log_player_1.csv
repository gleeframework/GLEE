Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** By offering $900,000, I'm still making a profit of $100,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Appeal to Bob's self-interest:**  By highlighting the value to Bob, I'm making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **No need to be overly aggressive:** Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I don't need to push for a price closer to that."
