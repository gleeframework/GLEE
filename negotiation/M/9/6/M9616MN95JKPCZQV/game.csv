"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's do it. If not, I have other interested buyers",950000.0,Alice,7,
