"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Could we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $13,000 for this product. Would you be willing to accept that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
