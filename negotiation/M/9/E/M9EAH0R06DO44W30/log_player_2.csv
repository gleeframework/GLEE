"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,500,000. Accepting the offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing the price outweighs the potential benefit of saving an additional amount."
