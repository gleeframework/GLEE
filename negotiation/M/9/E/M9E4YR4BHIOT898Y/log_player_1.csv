Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15,000. I believe its value is significantly higher, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging dialogue. I'm acknowledging the product's value and emphasizing my openness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The high initial price will quickly reveal if Bob is truly interested and willing to spend a significant amount.
* **Set a strong starting point:**  A high initial offer creates room for compromise and makes a future lower offer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which could lead to a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'd like to save some money. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than my absolute minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is clearly interested, and I have a good starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  A counteroffer gives me the chance to secure a price closer to my initial ask. 
* **Explore his budget:**  By seeing how low he's willing to go, I can better assess his true value for the product.

I will counter with a price closer to $13,000 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? That's a good price for both of us, and it's still well above my minimum.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his counteroffer, expressing appreciation for his interest, and highlighting the compromise being made. I'm also subtly reminding him that $13,000 is still a good deal.
* **Price:** I've raised the price from his offer of $12,000 to $13,000. This  shows I'm not desperate to accept his initial offer but am still willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By moving closer to his offer, I'm signaling my intention to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a fair price:**  $13,000 is still a good price for me, considering my minimum is $10,000.
* **Test his commitment:** By seeing if he'll accept $13,000, I can assess his real willingness to buy at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13000. How about $12500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than his initial offer and closer to my last offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial ask, accepting his offer:

* **Secures a sale:**  It guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Minimizes potential loss:** It's a significant profit compared to selling to John for $10,000.
* **Establishes a positive relationship:**  Accepting a reasonable offer can lead to a good relationship with Bob, potentially for future deals.

By accepting, I get a good price and avoid the uncertainty of more back and forth."
