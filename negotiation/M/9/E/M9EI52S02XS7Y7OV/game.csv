"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product is tempting,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
