Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so we need to offer it below that for him to even consider it.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** We're secure knowing John will buy it for $150 if Bob refuses.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob with a price he might find attractive while still maximizing your potential profit."
