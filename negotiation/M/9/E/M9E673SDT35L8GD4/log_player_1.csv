Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than John's offer of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer, but the potential reward of earning an extra $100,000 is worth it.
* **Uncertainty:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so starting high allows me to potentially capture more of the value.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll go with John's offer to ensure I sell the product for at least $800,000."
