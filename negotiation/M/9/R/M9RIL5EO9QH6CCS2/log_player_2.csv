"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! Would you like to make it yours for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's clear she's starting with a very inflated price.  You know you have a backup option with John at $80, so it's time to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too steep for me, Alice.  How about we start at $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a much better deal. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly indicates the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Aim:**  My goal is to get the product somewhere between my ideal price ($80) and the middle ground between our starting points."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $100 is still significantly higher than both my target price and John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so there's still a chance to get the price closer to my range. 
* **Leverage:** I can use the threat of buying from John to encourage Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving a bit, Alice, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could offer you $70.  It's a fair price, and I'd be happy to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Below Target:** However, my offer remains below my $80 maximum, leaving room for a possible counteroffer from Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""closing the deal right now"", I'm subtly implying that I might consider other options if she doesn't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $70, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice's counter-offer shows she's not budging much. Her latest offer of $110 is barely better than her previous one.  
* **Better Alternative:**  John offers the product for $80, a full $30 cheaper than Alice's current offer.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a cost in terms of time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
 
It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed savings with John."
