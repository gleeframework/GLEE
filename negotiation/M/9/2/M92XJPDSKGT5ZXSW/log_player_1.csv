"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,625,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $1,625,000 is a good starting point for our negotiation. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1675000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,625,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I'm not budging from that price, so I hope we can meet there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is holding firm at $1,625,000.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether, I'll accept his offer. It's still a good price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $1,500,000."
