Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is still below my minimum desired price but above what Bob considers it to be worth. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial deal without risking losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that should be beneficial for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad we're able to continue discussing this. Given my financial situation, I can only agree to $860,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum desired price. It's also likely that continuing to negotiate could lead to further price reductions or even a stalemate. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
