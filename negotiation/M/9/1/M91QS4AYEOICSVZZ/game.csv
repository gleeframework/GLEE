"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 to start. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
