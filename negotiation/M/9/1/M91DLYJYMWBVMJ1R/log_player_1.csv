Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer sets a high starting point, but it's still within Bob's range of what he's willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters, while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $1,125,000 is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to earn. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm meeting Bob halfway on his last offer, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  If he rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and at this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
