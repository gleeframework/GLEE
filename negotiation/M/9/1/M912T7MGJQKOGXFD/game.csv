"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000, which is a generous offer considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $920,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $885,000. This is a fair price that considers both our desired outcomes and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",885000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $885,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to think about the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me consider it... Alright, I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
