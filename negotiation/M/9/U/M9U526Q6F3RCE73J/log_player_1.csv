Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer gives Bob the impression that I'm serious about maximizing profit, while also leaving space for a potential counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a good price for the product, but I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum, and I still have time to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,550,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product is important to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but his offer is still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm open to a compromise - let's meet at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000. Would you be willing to settle at that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not willing to settle yet, and I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to reach a deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,350,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
