Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, considering its potential benefits to my business. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise given the potential it holds for your business. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for my business. Let's close this deal now.
