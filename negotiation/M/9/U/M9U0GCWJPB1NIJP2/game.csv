"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,100,000, reflecting its unique capabilities.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, considering its potential benefits to my business. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise given the potential it holds for your business. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for my business. Let's close this deal now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
