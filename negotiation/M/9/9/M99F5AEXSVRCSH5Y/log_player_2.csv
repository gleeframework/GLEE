"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth. I propose to sell the product to you for $14,000, which is a significant discount compared to its market value and still allows me to recover most of its cost. This offer is exclusive to you and is valid for the next 24 hours. I trust this proposal aligns well with your expectations and budget. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed, please let me know immediately. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get a better price.  Here's why:

* **Maximum Price:** You're willing to pay $15,000, but your goal is to save as much as possible.
* **John's Price:** John acts as your safety net, guaranteeing you can get the product for $15,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to her $10,000 value. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you leave the door open for further negotiation with Alice while still having the option to buy from John."
