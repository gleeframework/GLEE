"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000, so you have a significant opportunity here to save some money. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
