"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm aiming for. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is the absolute most I can afford. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
