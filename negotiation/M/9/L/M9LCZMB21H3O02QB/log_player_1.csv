Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This leaves a significant amount of profit for me while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000.  This initial offer gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still secure a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with $975,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. This price should be appealing enough for Bob to consider, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit ($960,000) and closes the deal. Continuing to negotiate may risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John for a lower price."
