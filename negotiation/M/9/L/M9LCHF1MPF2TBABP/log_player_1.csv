Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Offering the product slightly below Bob's valuation makes it highly likely he'll accept, ensuring you don't have to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest likely profit."
