Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable.  How about a price of $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. Offering it at $140 gives him a good deal while still maximizing Alice's profit.
* **Above Alice's Minimum:**  The offered price is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring a profit regardless.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal with Bob, who values the product more than John."
