"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable.  How about a price of $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer. You're willing to pay $150, so you have some room for negotiation."
