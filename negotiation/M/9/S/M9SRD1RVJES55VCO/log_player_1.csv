I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $120."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm counteroffering with $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum.  I hope Bob sees the value in this offer and accepts."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is reasonable and I'm confident I can make a profit.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and I'm satisfied with this outcome."
