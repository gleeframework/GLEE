"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my top limit. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between our current offers.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
