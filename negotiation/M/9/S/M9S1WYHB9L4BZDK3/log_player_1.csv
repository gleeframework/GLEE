{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He's willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in your product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is still a good amount, it's significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm meeting Bob halfway, but still holding firm to my initial offer. This shows him I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my top limit. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between our current offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum price and represents a decent profit. There's always a risk of further negotiation, and I don't want to push him away. I'll accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
