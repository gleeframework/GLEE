"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $20,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to secure a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would cost $15,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. However, Bob might be able to get an even lower price from Alice with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $14,500. This is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and while there's still room for negotiation, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $15,000, securing the product within budget and avoiding further negotiation that may lead to a higher price."
