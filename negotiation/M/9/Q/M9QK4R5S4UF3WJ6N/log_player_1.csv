"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally like to get ($15,000), hoping to maximize my profit.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this offer is higher than his perceived value. This should give me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This counteroffer is my minimum acceptable price.  I believe that by sticking to this price, I can still secure a good deal while also respecting my own value for the product."
