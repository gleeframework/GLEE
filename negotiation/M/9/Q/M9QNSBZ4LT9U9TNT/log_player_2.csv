"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer of $90 is still above your target.
* **Negotiation is worth trying:**  You have 10 rounds and there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** I'm starting my counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to show my commitment to getting a good deal.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I want to get the price as low as possible, I'm also leaving room for Alice to counter-offer. This avoids a stalemate too early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While slightly lower than the initial offer, $95 is still above my target.
* **Continuing negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to continue rejecting offers and counter-offering until I reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying below my target:** $88 is still below my maximum price of $120, and I believe there's room for Alice to meet me in the middle. 
* **Building towards a deal:** By incrementally increasing my offer, I'm aiming to find a price both Alice and I can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice's offer has fluctuated, it remains above my target price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I believe there's still potential for a better deal. 
* **Counter-offering is the best strategy:**  By rejecting and counter-offering, I'm demonstrating my commitment to securing a good price.  It's likely Alice will need to come down further to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** Alice's offer of $97 is still too high, but I'm showing willingness to compromise by increasing my offer from $88 to $92, which is halfway between our last two offers.
* **Building towards a deal:**  With only 4 rounds left, I want to increase the chances of a deal.  This counteroffer demonstrates a genuine attempt to find common ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Even though I'm increasing my offer, I'm still below my maximum price of $120, so I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $99 is only $1 away from my maximum price of $120.  I'm not willing to pay that much yet.
* **Negotiation is close:** We are in the final stages of the negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue to counter-offer.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While I could buy from John for $120, I have a chance to save money by continuing to negotiate. It's worth the risk of potentially losing the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my final counteroffer before I have to decide between buying from Alice or John.
* **Compromise:** I'm raising my offer to $95, which is closer to Alice's offer but still within my budget.  
* **Minimizing loss:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John for $120.  This counteroffer minimizes the potential loss by pushing Alice to accept a price closer to my ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Alice's final offer of $100 is still above my maximum price of $120.
* **Time is running out:** With only one round left, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Buying from John for $120 guarantees I get the product. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking not getting the product at all.  I've already saved money compared to John's initial price, and the extra cost is minimal considering I've already put in effort to negotiate."
