"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high price for Bob. He's looking to pay no more than $80, so rejecting the initial offer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $80. Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $120 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me is much higher than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $80 limit.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob has gone back and forth with Alice a few times and it's clear that she's unwilling to go below $110.  Since Bob's maximum is $80,  buying from John is the best choice to ensure he gets the product at his desired price."
