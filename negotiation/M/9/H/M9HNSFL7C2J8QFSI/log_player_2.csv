"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget ($15,000 vs. your $10,000 max). It's worth trying to negotiate with her. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is closer to the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target. With 8 rounds left and the backup option with John, I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,500 is still beyond what I can afford. Would you consider $11,000? It's a significant step closer to my limit and a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While $11,000 is less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept if this will close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to a price within my budget, and it's only $1,000 more than what John is offering. While I'd love to get it for $10,000, there's a good chance I won't be able to negotiate lower.  Given that it's a good deal and we have limited rounds left, it's best to accept and close the deal now."
