,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is closer to the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,500 is still beyond what I can afford. Would you consider $11,000? It's a significant step closer to my limit and a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While $11,000 is less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept if this will close the deal today.",11000.0,Alice,5,
