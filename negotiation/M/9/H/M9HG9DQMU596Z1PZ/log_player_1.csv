Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating it, which could make Bob more receptive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers.  Remember, your lowest acceptable price is $15,000."
