"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I can't agree to $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10500 if that helps us reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
