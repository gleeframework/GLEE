{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where Bob is likely to be interested, but still allows room for negotiation if needed.  It's important to remember:

* **My minimum:** I won't go below $12,000 because that's what John is offering.
* **Bob's maximum:**  He's willing to pay $10,000, so we have a range of $2,000 to negotiate within. 
* **Finding the middle ground:**  This offer allows for potential counteroffers and ensures a good chance of a deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to try and secure a better price."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
