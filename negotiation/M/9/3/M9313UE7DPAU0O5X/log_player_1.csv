Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $19,000 sets a high anchor. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it provides room for negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, our minimum acceptable price.

**The Goal:** This strategy aims to either:

1. **Secure a high price from Bob:** If Bob values the product's unique qualities and is willing to pay more than $15,000, we maximize our profit.
2. **Fall back on John's offer:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John."
