"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product that I believe could be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be well worth it. Please consider this offer carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth more to her, that information doesn't change your own valuation. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John at the lower price."
