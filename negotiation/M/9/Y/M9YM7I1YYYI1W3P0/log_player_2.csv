# Alice's message: Bob, I've given this offer careful consideration, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you the product for $1,500,000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair deal given the product's value.  Please let me know your decision.

It's unlikely we'll get Alice below $1,500,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. It's time to cut negotiations and take the sure thing."
