Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  John acts as a safety net, ensuring you'll get at least $100.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum while staying below Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $130 is a strong starting point, there might be room to negotiate slightly upward if Bob hesitates.
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:**  Offering it too close to $150 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer and forcing you to sell to John for less."
