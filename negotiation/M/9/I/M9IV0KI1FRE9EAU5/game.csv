"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm excited to discuss this opportunity with you. To kick things off, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer and provide your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, it falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,600,000. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit beyond what I can justify. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,300,000? This would represent a significant investment on my end while still recognizing the value of your product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
