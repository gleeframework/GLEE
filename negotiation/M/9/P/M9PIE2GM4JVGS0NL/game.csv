"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my expectations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
