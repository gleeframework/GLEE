"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I don't think the product is worth more than $150 to me, and buying it from her for $175 is too expensive. I'll look for a better deal.
