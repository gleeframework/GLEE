"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you know the product is worth significantly less to her ($120)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $110, we're aiming slightly below Alice's value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and acknowledges Alice's offer. We want to maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ultimate goal is to buy for less than $150 (John's price) and ideally closer to Alice's perceived value of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price. It's less than John's offer ($150) and a fair compromise between your initial offer and Alice's starting price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might be able to negotiate a few more dollars off, there's a risk Alice might walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
