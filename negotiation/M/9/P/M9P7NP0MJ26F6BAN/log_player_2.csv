"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get a better price from John ($1,000,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and save $250,000."
