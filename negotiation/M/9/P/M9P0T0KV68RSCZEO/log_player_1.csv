"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows I believe the product is valuable.  I'll need to see how Bob reacts to this offer before making any further decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get $8,000 for the product, I believe it's worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up on his price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I have time to see if I can close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get a lower price, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000 right now. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit. I still have plenty of rounds left and don't want to rush into selling for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $8,500.  This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than his last one. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm also not willing to go below my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems to be determined to get a lower price, and we're now at a point where I'm not sure if I can get him to budge. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether, and Jhon is offering me a safe and reasonable price.  I'm going to sell the product to Jhon."
