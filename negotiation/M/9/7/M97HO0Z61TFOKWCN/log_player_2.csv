# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further back-and-forth."
