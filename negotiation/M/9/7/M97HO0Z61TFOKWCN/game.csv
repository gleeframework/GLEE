"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
