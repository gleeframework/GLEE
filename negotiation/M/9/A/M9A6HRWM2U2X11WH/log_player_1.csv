Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm asking for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to justify the high price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different opening prices and messages to see what works best."
