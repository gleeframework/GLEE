"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! It looks great, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is too low, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $125 is cutting it too close. Perhaps we could settle on $160? That's a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  How about $140? That's the best I can do.",140.0,Bob,6,
