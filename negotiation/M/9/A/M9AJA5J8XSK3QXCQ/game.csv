I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so how about $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
