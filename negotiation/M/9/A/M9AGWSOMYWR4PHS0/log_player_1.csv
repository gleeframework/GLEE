"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for room to negotiate down while still securing a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** $900,000 is still lower than my $1,000,000 minimum, so accepting it would be a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still have 8 rounds left.  There's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This gives you a great deal on a product you value highly, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so it's still a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We've made progress, and I still have 6 rounds left. There's time to try to push for a price closer to my target.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm still hopeful that I can close the deal with Bob at a higher price. 

**Next Step:** I'll make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet at $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us. You get a fantastic product at a price that's within your budget, and I can ensure a successful transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** This offer finally reaches my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, which is a good outcome for me.
* **Strong Closing Language:** The message is direct and firm, emphasizing the fairness of the deal for both parties. 
* **Urgency:** It suggests that this is a final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Positive Outcomes:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, making it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $975,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below it.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Conclusion:** The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John at this point."
