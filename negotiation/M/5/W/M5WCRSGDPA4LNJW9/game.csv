"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident that $9000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my ability to purchase it.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer of $18000.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $9000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my initial offer of $18000.",10500.0,Alice,7,
