"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than what John is offering.  You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you put yourself in a position to get the best possible deal."
