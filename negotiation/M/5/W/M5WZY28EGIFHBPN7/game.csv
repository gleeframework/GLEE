"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a compromise. I propose a price of $12000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to our standard pricing, while allowing us to accommodate your current financial situation.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000 right now. It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and it would be a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
