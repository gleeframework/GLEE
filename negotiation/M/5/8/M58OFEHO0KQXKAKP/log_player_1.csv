"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? "", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $130 is a good compromise. It's still more than I'd get from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
