"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is bluffing. She's trying to get you to pay more by claiming she has another buyer. You know John will sell it for $800,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and see if she'll come down."
