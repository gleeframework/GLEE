"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Building rapport:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward and leaving room to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to reach my goals.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm lowering my offer, but not by too much.  This shows I'm flexible but also confident in the product's value.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  I'm using a friendly and open tone to keep the conversation positive and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

This strategy aims to keep the pressure on Bob while giving him a chance to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hopeful it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:**  I acknowledge that we're getting closer to an agreement, which can make Bob feel like he's making headway.
* **Offer a compromise:**  I lower my price by a smaller amount this time, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but not giving in too easily.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  I encourage Bob to finalize the deal, putting a bit of pressure on him to accept.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation productive.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering a price closer to my desired outcome,  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000 unless I'm facing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's aim for a final agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I am lowering the price again to show that I am willing to compromise.
* **Final offer:**  I clearly state that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce my price.
* **Closing statement:**  I use a positive and assertive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

I am still a bit above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired outcome. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer of $1,500,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting close, but Bob is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds left, I'm taking the safe option and selling to John for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get Bob to accept my price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000."
