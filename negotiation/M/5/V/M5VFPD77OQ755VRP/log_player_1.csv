"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for him to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value, but still higher than what he offered. I'm also emphasizing the deal for him to encourage acceptance."
