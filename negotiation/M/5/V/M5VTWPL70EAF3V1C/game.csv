"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $1,000,000 even.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000, Bob. I've already told you that's the price I'd sell it to John for. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to you. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
