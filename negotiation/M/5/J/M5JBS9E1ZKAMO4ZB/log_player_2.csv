"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above her desired price ($1,200,000) and below your maximum price ($1,500,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this asset. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1280000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable return. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price of $1,250,000. Accepting this offer would allow you to buy the product for a good price, saving you $220,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
