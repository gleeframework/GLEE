"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $85 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and more expensive than buying from John. You should reject the offer and aim for a better price or buy from John."
