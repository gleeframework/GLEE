You can do better than $900,000.  There's a significant difference between Alice's value ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000), so you have room to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $850,000. This is a fair price considering her value for the product and my maximum budget. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a significant reduction from her initial offer."

Alice is being stubborn, but I still have room to negotiate a better price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $875,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good deal.  It's a compromise that hopefully will be acceptable to Alice."

Alice is pushing me too high.  It's clear she's not willing to come down much further, and I'm getting close to my maximum.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
