```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially save a significant amount of money.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $850000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
