"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $7,000?  That would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
