"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm confident this is a price that would be mutually beneficial.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
