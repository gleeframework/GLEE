Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm confident this is a price that would be mutually beneficial.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer.
