Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a good starting point.**  It's more than your minimum price, and it leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** This sets a positive tone and makes Bob more likely to respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and it still gives me a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $105 is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's. It's a clear signal that you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that significantly undervalues your product.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open and prevent a breakdown.
* **Highlight the compromise:** Emphasizing the ""compromise"" aspect shows Bob that you're trying to meet him halfway, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm looking to save as much money as possible. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$95 is close to your minimum acceptable price:**  While it's not ideal, it's still above your $80 floor and is a decent profit.
* **Bob's message indicates he's serious about $95:** He's willing to ""meet you halfway"" which suggests he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Negotiating further could risk losing the deal:**  It's possible Bob will reject another counteroffer, and then you'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting $95 secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
