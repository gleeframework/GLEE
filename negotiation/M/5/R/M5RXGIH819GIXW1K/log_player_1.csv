"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, but I'm not going to accept it right away. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore those options before settling for the bare minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for my bare minimum just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price and much higher than what John is offering. I am confident that I can't get a better deal with Bob and that John will not change his offer. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
