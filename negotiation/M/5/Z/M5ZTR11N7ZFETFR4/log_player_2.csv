Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your company.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to recover a portion of the product's worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $950000 is still not quite there for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $1000000 is a significant step forward, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Given the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for your company.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
