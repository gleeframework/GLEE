"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I get a decent price for the product.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal,  $110 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. It's still too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to stick with a price close to my previous offer. Bob seems to be willing to negotiate, so I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely we'll come to an agreement that benefits me more.  Rather than continue this potentially fruitless negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John.  This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
