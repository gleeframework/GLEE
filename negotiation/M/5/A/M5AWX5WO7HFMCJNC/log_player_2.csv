{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $10,000 to you, so Alice's offer is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $7,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also that you won't pay her full asking price."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm raising my offer to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but it's still significantly below her current price. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down in price again, it's still above my limit.  I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my breaking point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm raising my offer again to $10,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal.  However, it's still slightly below her current price and importantly, below my absolute limit of $10,000. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as I'm running out of rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still too high, and I only have three rounds left.  I'm not confident I can get her lower than $10,000, so it's time to go with John."
