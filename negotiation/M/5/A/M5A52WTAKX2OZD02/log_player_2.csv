Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute highest offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm above my maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go down to $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for my target price."
