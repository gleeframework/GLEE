"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $14,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle somewhere around $11,000?  That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be totally honest, $12,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute highest offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth.
