"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's priced at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts by showing interest in Bob as a potential buyer while simultaneously setting a price point higher than your minimum but lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This sets a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I'd prefer to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
