,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. Let's try to reach a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,000 is really pushing it. Let's settle at $15,500 and call it a deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
