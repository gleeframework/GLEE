"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I think this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",800000.0,Alice,3,
