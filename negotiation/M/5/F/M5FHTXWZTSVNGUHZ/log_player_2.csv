While Alice's offer is a bit lower, it's still above my target. I'm going to try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer.  I can potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still within my budget, and is a better price than buying from John for $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a lower price,  continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer."
