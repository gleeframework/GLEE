"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your collection. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer. To be honest,  $1,150,000 is the highest I can go. I think that's a very fair price.  Let me know if we can make that work!",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
