I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it also demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down to $1,750,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll be mindful of John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not willing to sell for such a significantly discounted price.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a comfortable profit margin. It also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while staying firm on my minimum acceptable price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reconsider my position and potentially adjust my counteroffer again.  I'm hoping to strike a deal that's fair for both of us, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for a price that is significantly less than John's offer. I'll counter with a price that is closer to his offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept a price that's too far below my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he continues to lowball me. I'll be closely monitoring the situation and deciding whether to proceed with Bob or sell to John based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've negotiated as much as I'm willing to with Bob.  I'm not comfortable with accepting such a low price, especially considering John is willing to pay $1,500,000.  I'm going to take John's offer and sell to him."
