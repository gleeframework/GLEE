"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it for a considerable discount. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. How about $700,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 to get this done today.  It's a strong offer and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the time is running out and I'm getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather sell to John and guarantee a profit than risk ending up with a lower price."
