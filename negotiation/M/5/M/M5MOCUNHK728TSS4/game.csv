"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to the table.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to $12,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to $12,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on a price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
