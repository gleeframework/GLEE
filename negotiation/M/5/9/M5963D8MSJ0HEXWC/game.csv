"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
