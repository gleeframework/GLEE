Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a significant profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $10,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $10,000 to Bob, as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I believe the product is still worth more to Bob.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has come up from his previous offer. Accepting $13,000 is a good compromise, especially considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with only $10,000 from John."
