"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we meet at $8,000?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,250. This represents a significant compromise on my part while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $7,250 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I'd like to add a condition: if you're willing to commit to the purchase within the next 2 rounds, I'll throw in some additional benefits, such as a free warranty and support. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
