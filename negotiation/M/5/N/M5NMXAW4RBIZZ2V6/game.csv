"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for my budget, would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $140 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
