Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and it's better to secure the product at the known $100 price from John."
