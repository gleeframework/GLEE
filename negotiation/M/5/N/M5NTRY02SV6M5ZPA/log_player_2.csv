"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintains a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Expresses Interest:** Shows Alice we are serious about purchasing but need a better price.
* **Significant Drop:** The counter-offer is $100,000 lower, demonstrating we're looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Still Above Alice's Value:**  We start above Alice's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value your offer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,120,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice came down a little, but we're still aiming for a better deal. There's space to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,090,000?"",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:** By saying ""to meet you halfway,"" we signal that we're willing to move from our previous offer.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $1,090,000 is a $30,000 concession from our last offer, putting pressure on Alice to make a similar move. 
* **Still Below John's Price:**  We're still well below John's $1,200,000 price, giving us room to negotiate before considering that option."
