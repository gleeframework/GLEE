Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $120.  Offering it at $100 allows us to potentially maximize our profit, gaining $20 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we want to maximize profit, starting too high might discourage Bob. $100 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John. Offering the product to Bob at a price closer to his perceived value increases the likelihood of him accepting and prevents us from having to sell it for less to John."
