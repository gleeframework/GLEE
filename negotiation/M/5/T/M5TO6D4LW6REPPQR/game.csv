"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm very interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,290,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
