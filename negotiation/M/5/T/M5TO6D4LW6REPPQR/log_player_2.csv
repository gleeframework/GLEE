"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her product value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm very interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, but still higher. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before deciding to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,275,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,290,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,290,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further rejection and potential counteroffers from Alice means Bob could end up paying more than he's comfortable with.  

Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a safer option as it guarantees Bob stays within his budget."
