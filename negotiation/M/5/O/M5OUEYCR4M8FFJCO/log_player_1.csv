{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit, even if Bob accepts your first offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It creates a starting point for further discussions, allowing you to potentially close the gap if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your own goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as he's clearly interested, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer considers the following:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not give away too much.
* **It's closer to your minimum:** This brings you closer to your desired price point, making it more appealing to you.
* **It's still within a reasonable range:** It leaves some room for further negotiation, which is important in securing a final agreement.

The message is also designed to be polite and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive relationship with Bob while setting clear expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but it's clear that we're too far apart on price.  To avoid further delays and ensure I receive a fair price for my product, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000."
