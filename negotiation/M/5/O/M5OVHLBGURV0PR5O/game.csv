"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $107.50. Let's try $109.  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
