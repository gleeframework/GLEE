"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor you at a $14,000 price point. While this is lower than your maximum, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's room to negotiate a better price from Alice."
