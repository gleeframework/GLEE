"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your seriousness. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $9250 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $9000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're firm on your price, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $9000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you halfway between $9250 and $9000. I'll offer it to you for $9125. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9125.0,Alice,7,
