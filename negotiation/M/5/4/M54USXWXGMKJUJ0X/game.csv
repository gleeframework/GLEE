"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
