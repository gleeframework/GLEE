"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a significant investment for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a substantial discount on my initial price and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and what it's worth to me.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this.  $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's more than fair. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,6,
