"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product,  $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant way off from what I had in mind. This product offers you substantial value, worth far exceeding your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $887,500? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",887500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you see the value in this product, and I do too. However, $887,500 is still a bit high for me. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to offer $865,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",865000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, my final offer.  This is a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands.",875000.0,Alice,5,
