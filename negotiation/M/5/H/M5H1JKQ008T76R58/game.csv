"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would allow me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
