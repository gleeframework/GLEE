"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell the product for $150, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would allow me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $135 is still within your budget of $150.  Accepting this offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous choice."
