"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,250,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can do $1,220,000, which is $30,000 above your latest offer. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,220,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to compromise and offer $1,180,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",1180000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I can do $1,200,000, which is exactly what I was willing to sell it to John for. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
