Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium, but if he rejects the offer, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a fair price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
