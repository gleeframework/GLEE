"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is too high.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is better than her initial offer, Bob is still hoping to get a better deal.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, and buying from John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's current offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Bob can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $16,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to go higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above what he wants to pay.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, and buying from John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's current offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Bob can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to go higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,250 is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above what he wants to pay.  At this point, the negotiations are getting a bit drawn out, and Bob may not be able to get a much better offer from Alice.  Buying from John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal at a lower price, and it's worth avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
