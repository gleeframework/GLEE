Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 might be a bit steep, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?
