"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 might be a bit steep, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me Alice.  While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit much.  How about we settle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $760,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
