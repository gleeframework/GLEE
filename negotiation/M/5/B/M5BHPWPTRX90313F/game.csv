"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. My initial price is $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  How about $1,350,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to keep my business running smoothly. Let's find common ground!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I believe $1,300,000 is a fair and reasonable price. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $1,275,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, considering the value I'll gain from the product. Can you consider this final offer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,275,000 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,290,000. This is a final offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to close this transaction. Let's make it happen!",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,290,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,260,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,200,000.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
