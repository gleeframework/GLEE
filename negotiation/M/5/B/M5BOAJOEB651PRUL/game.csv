"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for the product, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,750. How about we settle on $10,125? It's still a fair price for the product, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
