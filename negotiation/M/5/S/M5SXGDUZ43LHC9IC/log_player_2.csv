You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know it's worth no more than $1,500,000, and her starting offer is already significantly lower than that.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that her initial price is too high. This gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a better price, closer to Alice's actual valuation of $1,200,000.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. While not ideal, it ensures you won't be left without the product if negotiations with Alice completely fail."
