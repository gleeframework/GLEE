I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $175.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring I make a decent profit."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm running the risk of John getting impatient. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $140."
