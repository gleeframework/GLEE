"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.

You have three options:

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows I'm interested but also want a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While closer to my desired price, I think Alice might be willing to go a bit lower. I'll try one more counter-offer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $95?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price comfortably below my $120 limit while still offering Alice a decent profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $99. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm on her price, and $99 is a good deal, well below my $120 limit.  It's time to accept and avoid the risk of losing out on the product."
