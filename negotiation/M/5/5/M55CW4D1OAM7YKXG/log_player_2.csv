Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. Could you do $13,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd like to see if we can make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer, and it's above your maximum budget.  You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
