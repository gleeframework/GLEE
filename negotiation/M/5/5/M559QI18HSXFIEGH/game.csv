"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business as well.  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  It's important for me to get a price closer to the value I've put on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $700,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This reflects the significant value the product brings to your business and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
