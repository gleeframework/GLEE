Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still potentially attractive to Bob, given the product is worth $150 to him.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might walk away entirely, or that I might have to sell to John for $150."
