# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

While I'd still like to get the price closer to $750,000, Alice seems firm on her price. Accepting the $825,000 offer makes sense at this point. It's a significant saving compared to John's price, and further haggling might not yield a much better result."
