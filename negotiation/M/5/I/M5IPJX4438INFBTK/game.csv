"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
