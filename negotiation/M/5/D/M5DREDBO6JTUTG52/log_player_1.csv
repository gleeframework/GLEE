Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (your value and John's offer), you can afford to start negotiations higher.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $14,000 offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have any insight into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or passive), you might adjust your initial offer accordingly.
* **Market Information:**  While you know Bob's value is $10,000,  knowing more about the overall market value of the product could inform a stronger starting position."
