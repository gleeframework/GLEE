Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,190,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below John's offer ($1,200,000) allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
