"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is way over his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this is significantly lower.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer that's still below his maximum budget. This shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a good deal.  The offer is close to John's price, which gives Bob leverage to potentially walk away if Alice isn't willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He wants to see if he can get even closer to his budget, and potentially even lower than $800,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price closer to his desired budget. He's  showing that he is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay too much. This offer is still significantly less than Alice's previous offer, and is a solid middle ground. By presenting it as a fair deal for both, Bob is attempting to create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer to his ideal price, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He doesn't want to overpay, and he wants to see if he can push Alice further down.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.  Let's finalize it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's desired price, but still keeping it within his maximum budget. This shows that he is serious about buying the product and that he is willing to compromise, but only to a certain extent. By reiterating that it's a fair price and urging Alice to finalize the deal, Bob is creating a sense of urgency and hoping to secure a deal before he decides to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $975,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go any lower than $975,000.  This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiations to try and squeeze out a slightly better deal. Buying from John at $800,000 is the most financially sound decision, as it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that may not yield a better result."
