"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price.  We'll try to bring the price down in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than Alice's asking price ($175). This gives us room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Respectful:** The message remains courteous and acknowledges Alice's offer, which is important for maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is way too low. I'm willing to come down to $160. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $160 is still above your $150 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a decent gap between your last offer ($110) and her current one ($160), suggesting more room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of buying from John at $150 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $135, we're aiming for a compromise, splitting the difference between our last offer ($110) and her current one ($160). 
* **Shows Willingness:**  This demonstrates a willingness to move closer to her price, which might encourage her to do the same.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Importantly, we're still staying below our maximum budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really want to make this work.  $135 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $145.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Still Above Budget:** $145 is very close to your budget, but it's still above your $150 limit.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell, having dropped her price significantly. There's a good chance she might be willing to go a little lower, especially as you've been reasonable in your counteroffers. 
* **Limited Risk:** With only a $5 difference between her offer and your backup option (John), you're not risking much by holding out for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very fair, and I appreciate you working with me. I can do $140, and I promise that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** We're moving closer to her price by offering $140, demonstrating good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating it's our final offer, we're setting a clear boundary and signaling that we're serious. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This puts the ball in her court. She can accept a price close to her asking price or risk losing the sale altogether, as you have the option of going with John."
