"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about we split the difference and go with $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $90, which would be $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we go with $95?  That's closer to my budget and gives you a good price too.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
