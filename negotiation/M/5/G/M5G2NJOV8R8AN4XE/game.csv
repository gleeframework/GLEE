"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,250,000 to $1,300,000. I think this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
