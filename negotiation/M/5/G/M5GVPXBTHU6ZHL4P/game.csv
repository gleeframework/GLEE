"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,075,000. My final offer is $1,090,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial price, and I believe it's more than fair.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're motivated to sell, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt at a compromise. I'll offer $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
