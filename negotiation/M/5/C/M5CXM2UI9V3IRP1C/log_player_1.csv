Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get a better price from John.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for less than what I know I can get."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer, $8,750 is still significantly lower than what John is offering. I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't budge I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,825? This would be a good compromise for both of us.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer to try to get a bit closer to my goal. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
