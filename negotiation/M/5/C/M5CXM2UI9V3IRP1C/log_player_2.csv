"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you're already below your maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still above your target price of $8,000, and you have rounds to spare. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,750. Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still $900 above your target price, and you have 5 rounds left.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,825? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8825}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about $8,850? That's a good compromise for both of us. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You've successfully negotiated a price that's very close to your target price. While you could potentially keep negotiating, you're now just $850 above your ideal price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product and minimizes the risk of Alice going with John's offer."
