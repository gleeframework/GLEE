"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good,  $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
