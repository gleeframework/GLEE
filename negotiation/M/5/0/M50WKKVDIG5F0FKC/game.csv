,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would work well for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $75 is still a bit short of my target. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",95.0,Alice,5,
