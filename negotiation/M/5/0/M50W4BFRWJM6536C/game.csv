"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
