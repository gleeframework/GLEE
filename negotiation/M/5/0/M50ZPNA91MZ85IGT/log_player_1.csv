Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to limit ourselves by starting low. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if we present a strong case for its value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $20,000, we create space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above our minimum ($15,000).
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge empowers us to be firm in negotiations with Bob. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. How we proceed depends on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
