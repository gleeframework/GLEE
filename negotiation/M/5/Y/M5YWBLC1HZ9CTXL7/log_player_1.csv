Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  If he rejects, we can begin the counter-offer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a profitable price for me, and I'm hoping it's appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial target, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good deal, and I'm going to accept it."
