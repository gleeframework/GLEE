"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high for Bob. He is willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's budget. He's aiming for $800,000 and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in this product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but $975,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for $800,000, and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which represents a substantial commitment from my side.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $960,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us given the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $960,000, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  There are only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
