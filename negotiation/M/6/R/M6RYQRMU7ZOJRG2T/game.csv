"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still gives you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
