"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not comfortable meeting you at $9000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $12000. It's a compromise that's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $12000, which would be $10000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000.
