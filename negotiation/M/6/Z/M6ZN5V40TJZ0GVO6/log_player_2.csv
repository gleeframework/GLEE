Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to $10,500, but you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You've reached a point where the potential savings are minimal compared to the guaranteed price from John."
