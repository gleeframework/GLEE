"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $2000000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very high. I'm interested in the product but $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it, but I need to see some flexibility from you to make this deal work.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the previous offers, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $875000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1125000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
