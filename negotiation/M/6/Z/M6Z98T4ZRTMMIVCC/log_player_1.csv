Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very high. I'm interested in the product but $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it, but I need to see some flexibility from you to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
