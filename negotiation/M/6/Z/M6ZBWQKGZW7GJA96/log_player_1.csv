Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum value. I think this price is fair and will encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his offer.  While $7,500 is tempting, selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is more important than chasing a potential higher offer from Bob."
