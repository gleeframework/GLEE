Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about selling and that he's getting a potential ""deal.""
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning the other offer creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a slight risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee the $1,500,000, you should offer it directly to Bob.
* You can adjust the price slightly higher or lower based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
