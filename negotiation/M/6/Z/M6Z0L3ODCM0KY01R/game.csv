"Bob, I believe this product is truly valuable and has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, reflecting its exceptional worth. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This reflects its potential value while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't fully capture the unique benefits of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, a price that still reflects its value while remaining reasonable for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  This price is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
