"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my original offer. How about $825,000? This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to get a better price for my product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000? This is a compromise that I think is reasonable for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $800,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a reasonable price.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
