Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language (""great deal"", ""very useful"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, acknowledging that he may have a different perspective.

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I can hopefully get a price closer to my minimum desired value of $120 while still keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $95 is a good price, I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Budget:**  I'm starting by acknowledging Bob's budget concerns, showing that I'm listening to him.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This presents it as a fair compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us (""good deal""), which helps build trust and encourages agreement. 

By making a counteroffer that's a compromise, I'm hoping to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I believe we can reach an even better compromise. Could we agree on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is very close to my desired value.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll end up selling to John for $120.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and gets me close to my desired profit."
