"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I'm confident this offer reflects a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. To be frank, $13,000 is quite low considering the product's inherent value. How about we split the difference and settle at $16,500?  This offer demonstrates my willingness to be fair while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $16,500 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Given the price John is offering, I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for this product. Let's close this deal before I change my mind.",14000.0,Bob,6,
