"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, based on my current budget and financial planning, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. I would like to propose an alternative that might be more in line with what I can afford at this time. How about we aim for $875000? I believe this could still be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given this matter considerable thought, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the latest offer of $925000. My budget constraints remain unchanged. I would like to propose one final offer of $900000. This amount still allows me to consider the product's value while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $915000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
