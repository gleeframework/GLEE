"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I was thinking more in the range of $9,500. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and you to get a good value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $10,000",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $10,200? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and you to get a good deal.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. Can you meet me at $9,900? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. You're getting closer, but $9,900 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about we settle at $10,100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,900. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. I'd like to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget",9900.0,Bob,10,
