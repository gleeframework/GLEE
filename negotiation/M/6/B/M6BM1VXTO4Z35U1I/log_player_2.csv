"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below my maximum, there's room for negotiation. I should aim lower, closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to bring the price closer to my target. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and risking a worse outcome, especially since I can get the same price from John."
