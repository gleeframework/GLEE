Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum ($100), leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. If he rejects, you'll have more information to work with for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $80 is significantly lower than your minimum price. You'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your minimum to see if you can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 meets your minimum price, so you should accept. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a higher offer and you risk losing the sale to John.  Accepting ensures a sale at your minimum price and minimizes the risk of getting nothing."
