"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $140 is still above Bob's maximum price of $150. 
* It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider it. To move forward, I propose selling the product to you for $135. This is my best offer, and I hope it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is within Bob's budget of $150. 
* While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up buying from John for $150 is high.
* Accepting the offer at $135 allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and save $15 compared to buying from John."
