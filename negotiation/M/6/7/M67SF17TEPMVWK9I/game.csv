"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,
