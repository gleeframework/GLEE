"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while leaving you with a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
