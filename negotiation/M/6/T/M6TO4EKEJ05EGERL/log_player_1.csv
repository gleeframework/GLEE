"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm a bit of a savvy buyer and I've done my research, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,500? This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm confident I can get at least $12,000 from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be at least at $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fantastic deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $12,000. How about we meet at $11,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. I'd rather sell to John for $12,000 than risk losing out on a deal altogether."
