Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only $1,000 more than what John would pay, it's still a better deal for me.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go any higher, and risking another counteroffer could result in a lower price or even a deal falling through."
