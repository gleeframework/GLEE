# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
