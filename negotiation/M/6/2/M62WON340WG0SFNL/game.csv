"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $14,000 is still a little low for me. How about $15,500? That's a great price for a product worth much more. I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",14500.0,Bob,6,
