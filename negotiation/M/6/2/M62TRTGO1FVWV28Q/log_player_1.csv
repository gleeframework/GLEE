Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

This is a reasonable offer, considering Bob is willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'll decide to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer to Bob will be:

{""product_price"": 9,400}
