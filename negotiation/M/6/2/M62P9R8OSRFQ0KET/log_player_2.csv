Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, he can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

``` 
Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price, and Bob has already rejected a lower offer from Alice. Accepting the offer means getting the product at a good price."
