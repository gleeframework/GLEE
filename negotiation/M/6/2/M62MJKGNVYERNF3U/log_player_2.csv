"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to understand Alice's flexibility and establish a lower anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but firm, clearly stating my price limit while expressing continued interest in the product.

This strategy aims to encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation as I won't be able to get a lower price."
