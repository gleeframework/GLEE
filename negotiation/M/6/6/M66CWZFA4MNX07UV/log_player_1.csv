Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's highly valuable and worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to maximize my potential profit by starting with a higher offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and desired profit margin, you could adjust the offer price accordingly."
