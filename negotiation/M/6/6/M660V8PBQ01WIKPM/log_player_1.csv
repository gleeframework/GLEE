Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value that would be beneficial to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a potential win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him, and you make a $100,000 profit above your guaranteed sale price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide whether to slightly lower your price or stick with John's offer."
