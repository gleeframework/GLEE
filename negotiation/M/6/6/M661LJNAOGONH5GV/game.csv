,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for me while acknowledging your budget constraints.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
