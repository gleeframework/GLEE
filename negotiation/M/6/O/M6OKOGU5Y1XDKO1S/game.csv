"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
