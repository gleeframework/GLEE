Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds very interesting, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I hope you'll reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your absolute maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1000000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
