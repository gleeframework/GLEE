"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
