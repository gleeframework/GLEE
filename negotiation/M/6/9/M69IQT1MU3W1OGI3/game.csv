"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value within my business model.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable margin for both of us. I'm eager to find a solution that works for us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price.  To show my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value and the potential for our successful partnership. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
