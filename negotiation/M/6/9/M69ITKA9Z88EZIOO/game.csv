"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $13,000, and I believe that's a fair price considering both our perspectives.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $14,500, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the last two hundred dollars. I'll sell the product to you for $14,200, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",14200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  While $14,200 is closer, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $13,800, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's reach a deal and make this happen!",13800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'll sell the product to you for $14,000, which is the same price I offered initially, but I'm willing to stick with it this time. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still committed to buying this product, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $13,900, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen!",13900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though - I'll sell the product to you for $13,950, which is just $50 more than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13950.0,Alice,9,
