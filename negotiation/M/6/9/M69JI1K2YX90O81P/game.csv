"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial situation. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875000?  This gives you a good deal on the product, and allows me to secure a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued patience and understanding, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $860000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial capacity. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your business, $860000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that, considering its potential.  Would you consider a price of $865000? This small increase will allow me to accept your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",865000.0,Alice,5,
