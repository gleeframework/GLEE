,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we consider $1,500,000? This is a fairer offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark. However, to be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a fair and final offer considering its true value and potential return on investment.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
