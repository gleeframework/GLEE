Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start there.  Beginning with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, we know he's likely not willing to come close to our desired price range.
* **Fallback Option:** We have a secure offer from John at $15,000.  This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price accordingly.  The goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
