# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is my best offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, $825,000 is still a bit too high. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my final offer. This is a fair price, given the product's value to me.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to sell at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is still too high.  I'm happy to buy from John at $800,000, rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
