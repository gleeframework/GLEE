Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand you're working within a budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe you'll still be getting a fantastic product at a competitive price.
