Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can secure an even better deal with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential to Bob, justifying the price and encouraging a positive response.

By starting with a strong but potentially negotiable offer, I increase my chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
