Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Can we work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, we need to nudge him closer to at least the $1,400,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle at $1,400,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end and represents a fair price for this quality of product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far. Can we work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,400,000, Bob is consistently moving in smaller increments. Accepting at $1,300,000 provides a $100,000 buffer over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob significantly lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
