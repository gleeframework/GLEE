Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This still gives you a good profit and keeps me within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
