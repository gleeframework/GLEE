"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what you're willing to pay and significantly higher than what I'd sell it for elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts!",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This still gives you a good profit and keeps me within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This still leaves you with a good deal and gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
