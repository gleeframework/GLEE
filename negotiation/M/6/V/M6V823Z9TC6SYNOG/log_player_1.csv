Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

Here's why this approach is strategic:

* **Ambitious but Grounded:** The offer starts significantly above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to still gain a considerable profit ($75,000).
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making the price less about arbitrary negotiation and more about inherent worth.
* **Open for Dialogue:** The tone encourages discussion.  While firm, ""I believe this is a fair deal"" invites Bob's perspective and potential counter-offer.

By aiming high initially, you maximize your potential gain while still making the deal enticing for Bob."
