"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it right now. Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price still offers you a great value, and it's closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This price is a good compromise, and it's closer to your desired range. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
