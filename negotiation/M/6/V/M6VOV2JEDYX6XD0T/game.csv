"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand that you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $10,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $11,500. This would be a great price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
