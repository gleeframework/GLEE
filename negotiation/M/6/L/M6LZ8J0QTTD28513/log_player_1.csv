"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
