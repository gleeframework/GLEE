"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than you're willing to pay, and you have a better option with John.  You can try to negotiate with Alice, but you're in a strong position to either counteroffer or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit of $10,000.  You're guaranteed to get the product for your maximum price with John, so it's the most financially sound option."
