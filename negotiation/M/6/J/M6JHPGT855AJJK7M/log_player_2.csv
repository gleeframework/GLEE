"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a very attractive price.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, so it's a win-win situation.  Consider it carefully, as this offer won't last long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
