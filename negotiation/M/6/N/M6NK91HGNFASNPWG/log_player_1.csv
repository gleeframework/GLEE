"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point and allows for potential concessions in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. There are still 8 rounds remaining to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show willingness to negotiate. However,  $9,000 is still a good price for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000.  This gives Bob some room to counter if he wants, but still keeps the pressure on him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're halfway through the negotiations and there's a risk of further stalemates. There is also a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I might end up losing more by rejecting his offer."
