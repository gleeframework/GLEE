Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can still potentially get a higher price by counter-offering.  However, if negotiations drag on, you always have the option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $102 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $2 less than what John is willing to pay.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and accepting his offer is the best option to maximize your profit at this point."
