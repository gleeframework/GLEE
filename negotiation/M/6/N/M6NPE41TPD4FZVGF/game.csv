"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. Let me start with a price of $950000. This is slightly above my cost but well below market value considering its worth to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit steep. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $850000 at this point. This is a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900000. This is a compromise between our previous positions, aiming to find a fair solution for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to go up to $875000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our negotiations so far, I would like to propose a price of $890000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and the costs involved. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",890000.0,Alice,5,
