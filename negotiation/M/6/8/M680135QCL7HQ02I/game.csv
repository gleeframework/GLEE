"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't go as low as $2,100,000.  Would you consider $2,200,000?  This reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $2,200,000 and $1,800,000, which would be $2,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",2000000.0,Bob,4,
