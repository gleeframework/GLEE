Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum, but gives me some room to negotiate. I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents potential further negotiation that could ultimately result in a lower price or even a rejection."
