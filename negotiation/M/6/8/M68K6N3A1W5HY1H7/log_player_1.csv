Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,800,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, there's still room to negotiate.  I believe I can get a higher price if I continue the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1550000? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,550,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price.  I'll counter with a price just below my minimum to see if Bob will bite.  If not, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
