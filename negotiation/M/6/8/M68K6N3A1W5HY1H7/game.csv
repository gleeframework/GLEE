"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1800000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1550000? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1550000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
