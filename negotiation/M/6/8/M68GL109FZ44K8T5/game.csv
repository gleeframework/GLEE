"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need something closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference - how about $10000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
