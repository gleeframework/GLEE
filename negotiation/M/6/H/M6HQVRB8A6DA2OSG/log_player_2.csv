"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $95 is still too expensive. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John, but you want to try to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:**  $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's $95 offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $85 is a compromise between your maximum price ($120) and Alice's minimum price ($80). 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** You still have 8 rounds left, so there's room to adjust the price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $100 is still more than you're comfortable with.
* **More negotiation is possible:** You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's likely room to get the price down further.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option:** You can always buy from John if the negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  $90 is a compromise between your last offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100. 
* **Signaling flexibility:**  By increasing your offer slightly, you show Alice that you're willing to negotiate and are open to a deal.
* **Leaving room for a final negotiation:** You still have 6 rounds left, allowing for further negotiation to reach a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's slightly lower than her previous offer, $105 is still above your ideal price range.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 5 rounds left, so there's still time to try and lower the price further.
* **John is always an option:**  Buying from John for $120 is your fallback, but you're determined to try and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:** $95 is a midpoint between Alice's last offer of $105 and your previous offer of $90.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** Increasing your offer slightly demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:**  With 4 rounds remaining, you can still adjust your price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $110 is getting close to your maximum price, and you're running out of time.
* **No significant room for negotiation:** You have only 3 rounds left, and Alice is unlikely to drop her price significantly.
* **Minimizing risk:** Buying from John for $120 guarantees you get the product. There's no guarantee you'll be able to agree on a price with Alice within the remaining rounds.

**It's better to secure the product now for a slightly higher price than to risk getting nothing at all.**"
