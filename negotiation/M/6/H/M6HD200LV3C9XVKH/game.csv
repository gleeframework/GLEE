"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $75 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $79. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",79.0,Alice,5,

I'm starting to think I'm getting a bit too close to buying it from John for $80. I'm willing to meet you at $78. Can you accept that price?,78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to buying from John, but I'm not ready to give up yet! I can offer you the product for $79.50. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",79.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to buying from John now, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $78. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from him. Can you reconsider?",78.0,Bob,8,
