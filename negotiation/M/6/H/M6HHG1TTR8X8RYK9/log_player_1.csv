Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer is a starting point. If Bob negotiates, you can gradually lower the price, staying above your minimum while gauging his interest.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message to Bob is positive and emphasizes value, which can encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a slightly lower price if you want to appear more flexible or if you think Bob might be highly sensitive to price."
