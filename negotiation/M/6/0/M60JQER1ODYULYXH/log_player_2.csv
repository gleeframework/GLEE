"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price than $1,100,000 from Alice.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's valuation ($1,000,000) and my maximum price ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation:** This is a good starting point for negotiation.  Alice is likely to want to sell, and this price gives her a profit.  However, it's also low enough that I still have room to bargain if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting her offer at $1,080,000 saves me $120,000 compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might walk away or counter with an even higher price.  It's better to secure this deal at a price that's still within my budget and saves me money."
