Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'll see how Alice reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't go much higher. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without risking losing Alice's interest."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly becoming more flexible with her price. I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget. If Alice accepts, I'll get the product at my desired price. If she rejects, I'll move on to buying from John, who is offering a guaranteed price."
