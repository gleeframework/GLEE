"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I need to be strategic, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price, especially since I have other options. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer.  I want to see if I can push him a bit further before considering selling to John. I'll reject the offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this offer shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also not willing to cave in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below it. I'm starting to run out of time, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
