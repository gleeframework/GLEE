"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is far above his budget, and he has several rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true market potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects its unique value while offering you a competitive advantage. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down somewhat, $1,150,000 is still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating to get a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still committed to finding a fair price for this product. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle -  I'm offering $950,000. This allows for a healthy profit for you while remaining within my price range.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. I'm willing to make a final adjustment to close this deal quickly. Let's settle on $1,025,000. This recognizes the product's value while offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $1,025,000 is still above his target of $800,000. He has more rounds to negotiate, and with each round, he can attempt to lower the price further.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if they can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting closer! While I appreciate your latest offer,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 975000}
