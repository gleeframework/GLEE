"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,900. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
