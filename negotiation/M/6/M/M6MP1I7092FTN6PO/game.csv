"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand the value this product represents.  I can't go lower than $1,300,000 and still make this worthwhile for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,275,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
