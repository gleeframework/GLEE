"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase such an item. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer, perhaps closer to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my financial situation, I am still unable to meet the $950000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a very fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. Given my current financial constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $800000. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $875000. I think this is a very reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $875000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,7,
