"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer but still provides a substantial profit margin for Alice if she accepts. This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor the negotiation lower:** By starting with a much lower offer, we aim to shift the negotiation's center point down, making a more favorable final price likely.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  This first counteroffer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate and move away from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. Rejecting and providing another counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to move closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to find a price that works for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  We are increasing our offer, demonstrating that we are serious about purchasing the product.
* **Maintain a significant gap from John's offer:** By staying significantly below John's price, we maintain pressure on Alice to negotiate while leaving room for further concessions. 

We are aiming to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties while avoiding a stalemate situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's make it $1,000,000 even. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to John's price. At this point, there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation. It's best to buy from John since it's the same price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
