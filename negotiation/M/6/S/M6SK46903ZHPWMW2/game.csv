"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,750? It's the highest I can go",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $9,250? This is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",9250.0,Alice,5,
