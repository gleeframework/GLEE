"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $9000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $10000, which I think is a fair price considering my budget.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. I think this is the lowest price I can accept and still make it worth my while. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still just a little too far apart from you. I'm ready to pay $9500 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
