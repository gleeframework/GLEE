"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price reflects a fair balance and allows for a successful deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
