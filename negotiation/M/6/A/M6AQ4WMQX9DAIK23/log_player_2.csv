Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925000 is the highest price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $1000000, which is a price that I think is still reasonable considering the product's value. I'll make one last offer of $987500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500.

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she came down slightly. I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially getting stuck with a higher price. I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000. It's a better deal for me, and I'm happy to avoid further negotiation."
