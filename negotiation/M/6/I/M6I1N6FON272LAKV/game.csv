"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000 for this product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to it, and I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1050000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance that with the value I believe the product holds. I'll meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $985000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",985000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I'll meet you at $990000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,9,
