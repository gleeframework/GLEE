"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $120 is significantly lower than what I need to sell the product for. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $155. This is a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
