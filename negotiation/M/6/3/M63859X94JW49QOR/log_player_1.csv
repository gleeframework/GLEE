Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your price, even if vague, can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer is high enough that if Bob counters, there's space to come down while still potentially making more than your guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $150 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is a decent offer, it's still below my initial ask and leaves room for negotiation.  I'll counter to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $165?"", ""product_price"": 165}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've come down from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Target Price:** This price point is still a significant markup from my minimum, and closer to my initial ask. 
* **Clear Goal:** By suggesting a specific number, I'm guiding the negotiation toward a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $150 is still a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his $150 offer. While I could counter again, there's a risk he walks away. $150 is a good profit margin above my minimum, and it's better to take a sure thing than potentially lose the sale altogether."
