"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
