"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is still a great deal, considering the uniqueness of the product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8500.

"I respect your position, Alice, and I'm glad we've narrowed down the price range. Given my budget constraints and the current market conditions, I believe $8500 remains a reasonable price for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,
