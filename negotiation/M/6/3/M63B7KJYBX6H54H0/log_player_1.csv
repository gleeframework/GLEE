"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I will reject Bob's offer because it is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer because it is the minimum I am willing to sell for.  While I could sell to John for the same price, this offer closes the deal in this round, minimizing any risk of the deal falling apart in future rounds."
