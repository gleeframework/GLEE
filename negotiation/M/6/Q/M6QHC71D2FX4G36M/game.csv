"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price for this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1500000 is still a bit higher than my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. While $1350000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1400000. This represents a further compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1400000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $1375000. If we can close at this price, it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your limits, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $1390000. This is a good compromise, and it gets us very close to a deal. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",1390000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $1390000 is getting very close to what I can do, I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $1380000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. This is my absolute final offer.",1380000.0,Bob,8,
