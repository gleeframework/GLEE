"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm very interested in this product and would be happy to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $8250.  Could we settle on $8000? I'm confident that this product is worth that much to me, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
