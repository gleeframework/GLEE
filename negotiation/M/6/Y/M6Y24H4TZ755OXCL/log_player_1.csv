"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We're aiming for the highest possible price, so starting significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is key. $2,200,000 provides substantial room for negotiation while staying within a believable range.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and emphasizing the ""return on investment"" aims to anchor Bob's perception to a higher value. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about making a sale. Bob's counter-offer will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:**  While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's crucial to remember we have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. There's still room to negotiate with Bob before considering John's offer. 
* **Understanding Bob's Position:** Bob's counter-offer, while a considerable drop, indicates he's serious and willing to pay a premium over his perceived value. This suggests further negotiation is possible. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're seeking a price closer to the middle ground between his offer and our initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the price,  I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By proposing $2,000,000, we signal flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We reiterate the product's high value, reinforcing the idea that our price is justified and encouraging Bob to stretch his budget further. 
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  Presenting the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see the negotiation as a collaborative effort rather than a battle."
