"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750 is too high, so I'll go with $10,250. That's the most I can afford.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. This is the lowest I can go, so let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
