While $10,250 is closer to my desired price than $10,000, I believe I can still do better. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. This is the lowest I can go, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob has remained firm at $10,250, and I'm running out of time. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $10,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
