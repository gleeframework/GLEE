"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is well below your maximum budget of $120.  Accepting her offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
