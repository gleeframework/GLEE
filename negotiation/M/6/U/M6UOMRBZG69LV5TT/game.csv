"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? That's my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer, at $8,875. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any lower. Let's make this deal happen.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no more. That's my absolute limit. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
