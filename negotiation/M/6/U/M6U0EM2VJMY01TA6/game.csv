"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get this great product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, it's very close to what I can afford. Would you consider $12,250?  I feel like that's a fair compromise and we could close the deal today.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,250 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,7,
