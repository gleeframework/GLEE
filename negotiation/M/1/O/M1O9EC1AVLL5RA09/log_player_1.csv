Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes my willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage in a back-and-forth.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, it's a sign that he's interested in the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $10,000. It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway and suggests that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I remind Bob that this is still a good price for him, considering the value of the product. 
* **Increased Pressure:**  By offering a price closer to my minimum, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Good Deal for Both:** This price is likely a good deal for both of us. Bob is getting a product he values at $8,000 for $9,000, and I'm getting a price close to my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will continue to reject offers and I'll lose the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000.

Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale and ensures I receive a price that's within my acceptable range."
