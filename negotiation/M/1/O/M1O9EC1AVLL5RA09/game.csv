"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $10000. It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
