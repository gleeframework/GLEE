Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $110, I'm allowing for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get at least $100.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation drags on or Bob seems unwilling to meet my minimum, I'll move on to selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** While $90 is a good price, it's still below my minimum of $100.  
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price from Bob.  I believe there's potential for him to go higher. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm happy to work with you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still ensuring I get more than $90.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob (""great deal"") and emphasizing my willingness to work with him.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $95 is a good middle ground, potentially making it more likely Bob will accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll sell him the product.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $85 is significantly below my minimum price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob seems unwilling to move further towards my price, suggesting the negotiation is unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired minimum price of $100, guaranteeing a profit and avoiding further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John, as this is the best option given Bob's stubbornness and my minimum price requirement."
