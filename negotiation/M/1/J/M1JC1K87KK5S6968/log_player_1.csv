Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Understanding Value:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and $800,000 to you.  Setting the price at $925,000 gives Bob a potential $75,000 gain while netting you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, maximizing profit with Bob is ideal. This offer attempts to secure the best possible outcome before resorting to the guaranteed sale."
