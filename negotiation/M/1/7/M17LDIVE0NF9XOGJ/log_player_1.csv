Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
