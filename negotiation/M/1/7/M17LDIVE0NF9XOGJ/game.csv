"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
