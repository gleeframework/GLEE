{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's a better deal for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
