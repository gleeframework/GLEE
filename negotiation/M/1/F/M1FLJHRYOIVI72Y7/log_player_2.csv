Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a better deal than my previous offer, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $900,000, and it's not worth the risk of her ending the negotiation.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is your maximum price."
