"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make it an exclusive offer just for you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's price of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.**  Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to save $100,000."
