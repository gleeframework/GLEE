I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price and have more rounds to negotiate."

While I'm still above my minimum threshold of $120, I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low. There are only a few rounds remaining, and it's likely his offers will continue to decrease. It's better to guarantee the $120 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower price from Bob."
