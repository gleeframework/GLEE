"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $80 right now. Would you be open to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us a chance to work something out.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  $120 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $80. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy.",80.0,Bob,4,
