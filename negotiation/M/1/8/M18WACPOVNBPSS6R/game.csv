"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum value for the product and the fact that I can purchase from John for $800000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering its value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1500000. I believe this price is reasonable and still a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer.

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1050000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm ready to offer $975000 for the product. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product.
