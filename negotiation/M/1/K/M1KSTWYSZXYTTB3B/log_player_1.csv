Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
