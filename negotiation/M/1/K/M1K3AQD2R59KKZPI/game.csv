"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too high for me. Given my valuation and the current market, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still above my limit.  Considering the value of the product to me and the potential for a quick sale, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while getting me closer to my desired price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still below my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $925,000 is still a bit too steep for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is a good compromise that allows us to both close the deal quickly and fairly.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $920,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $920,000 is still slightly above my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $915,000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers and the potential for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction. ",915000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $918,000.
