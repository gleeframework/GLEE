"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of the product.  Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  leaving room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $88, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $88 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price than John's offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John or running out of rounds.  
* **Potential Compromise:**  Alice has already shown flexibility by lowering her price. Further negotiation may not yield a significant difference."
