Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for Bob to make a profit as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.
* This initial offer is high enough to incentivize Bob to negotiate, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. 
* I'm leaving room for counteroffers, which will allow me to gauge Bob's level of interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, it's significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.** I believe Bob is still interested in the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a more favorable price. 
* **I have a backup option with John.** While I'm not immediately accepting John's offer, knowing that I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 provides me with leverage during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering in the middle:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $1,200,000 and my previous offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Maintaining a firm position:** This counteroffer still provides me with a good profit, while also showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will tell me if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price point or if he's firm on his lower offer. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide if I'm willing to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
