"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional features and support to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
