"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,000? That's a significant price jump from my initial offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
