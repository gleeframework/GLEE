{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good deal:**  $13,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, potentially leading to a profitable sale.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to participate, making it less likely for him to walk away immediately.

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the need to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000:** This price is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but also lower than my initial offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and maintains a positive tone. It reinforces the product's value to Bob while emphasizing the potential for a win-win outcome.

**Strategy:** 

By counter-offering at $9,000, I aim to:

* **Increase the offer:**  Move closer to my desired price while still being within a range that Bob might consider.
* **Maintain negotiation:** Keep the dialogue open and encourage further negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate that I am willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,000? That's a significant price jump from my initial offer and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean losing a significant amount of money. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's more in line with my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500:** This price is a compromise between my last offer ($9,000) and Bob's current offer ($7,000). It demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the potential value the product holds for Bob. It aims to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering at $8,500, I aim to:

* **Close the gap:** Get closer to a price that both parties might find acceptable.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlight value:** Remind Bob of the product's worth, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

This counteroffer should lead to a more agreeable price for both parties while still allowing me to achieve a profitable sale."
