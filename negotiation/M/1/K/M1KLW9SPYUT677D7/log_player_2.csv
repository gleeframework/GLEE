# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is still above your ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. It's a great compromise that should satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise and within my budget.  Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John."
