# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. Since you have a better option to buy the product from John for $100, it's best to reject Alice's offer."
