Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth ""a great deal,"" you're subtly anchoring its value in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Alternative Option:** Letting Bob know there's another potential buyer (even if not explicitly stated) creates a sense of urgency and competition.

**Important Note:** While John acts as a safety net, aiming for a price higher than $100 with Bob is the best strategy to maximize profit."
