"Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Since the product is worth $100 to you, there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75, which is still a good deal for Alice since she values the product at $100.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $80 is a good deal for me.  It's less than John's price and I'm comfortable paying that amount for the product.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy it."
