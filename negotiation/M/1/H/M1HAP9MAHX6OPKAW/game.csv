"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product offers even greater value than your initial assessment reflects. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price point acknowledges the product's unique advantages while still representing a significant investment on your part.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market demand and the product's value.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, to be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who sees the full value of this product at a price closer to my initial offer.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to see a significant move on price. Would you be willing to consider $1,850,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while still recognizing the true value of what's on the table.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,850,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market demand and the product's value.",1750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I've been upfront about having other options, and to be frank, $1,750,000 is too far off the mark for me to continue dedicating time to this negotiation.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I need to see a substantial offer, closer to $1,825,000, by the end of tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
