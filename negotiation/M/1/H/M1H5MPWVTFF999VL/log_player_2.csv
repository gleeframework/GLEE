"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, I'm aiming for a lower price point.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower price, framing it as a ""significant discount"" and a ""fair starting point,"" making it less likely for Alice to immediately reject the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:**  Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than John's offer, making it a very attractive proposition for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has already moved significantly in price, demonstrating her willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of not reaching a deal within the 10 rounds, potentially leaving Bob with no product.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer in this round offers the best value for Bob considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
