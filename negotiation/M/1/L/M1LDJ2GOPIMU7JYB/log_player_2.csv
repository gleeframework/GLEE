"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, Bob. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. Would you be willing to purchase it from me for $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no point in spending an extra $100,000 if you don't have to."
