Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), you have room to start high. Aiming for a significantly higher price allows you to potentially secure a much larger profit.
* **Justification:**  While the initial offer is high, you are framing it as a ""fair reflection"" of the product's value. This leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is not a demand, but an opening for discussion. This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still well above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation strategy. Bob may outright reject the initial offer. Be prepared to potentially lower your asking price during the negotiation process, but always aim to stay above your $1,500,000 minimum."
