"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1250000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it at full price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($1,000,000), you can still get the product for a better price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase the product for $1,000,000, saving you $250,000."
