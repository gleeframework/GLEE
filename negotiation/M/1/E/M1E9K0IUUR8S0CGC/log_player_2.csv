"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a top-notch item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're trying to save as much money as possible.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, you can use this as leverage to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very close, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save even more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $7,800 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price and still gives you a significant discount compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to save $2,200 compared to John's price."
