Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum price of $100, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** By sending a message along with the price, you demonstrate you're open to a conversation and not just trying to squeeze the maximum out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $110 is a little low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $120 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and gets me closer to my desired price."
