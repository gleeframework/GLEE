"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $105. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer you the product for $98. This is a good price for both of us, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $90.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. ",90.0,Bob,6,
