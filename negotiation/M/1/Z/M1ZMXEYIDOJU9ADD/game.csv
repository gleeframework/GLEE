"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm happy to pay $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget. What do you say?",145.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $145 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $155.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair. What do you say?",155.0,Alice,5,
