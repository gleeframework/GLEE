"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still outside my price range. Let's continue to work towards a solution that benefits both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair value considering my budget and its worth to you. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint between $1,250,000 and $1,000,000, which is $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
