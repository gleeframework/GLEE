"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get a bit closer to my goal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That way, we can both get a good deal.",102.5,Bob,4,
