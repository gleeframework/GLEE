"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,600,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's value, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
