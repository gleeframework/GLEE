Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting $105 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
