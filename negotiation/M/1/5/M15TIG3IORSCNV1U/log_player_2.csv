"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still too high, and Bob has room to negotiate a better price. He should aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still too high for Bob. He should aim for a price closer to $950,000. There are still several rounds left, and Bob has room to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price given the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,050,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has made a significant concession by lowering her price to $1,050,000. This price is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a breakdown in the deal and Bob may end up buying from John at a much higher price."
