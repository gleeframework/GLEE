"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly above the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This means you have some leverage to reject Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $1,400,000. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product.  I could consider $1,350,000. I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Although it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to her.
* **You have more room to negotiate.** You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price. There's still potential to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a safe fallback.**  This gives you leverage to keep pushing for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price, given our both sides' positions. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
