"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $1,400,000. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product.  I could consider $1,350,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price, given our both sides' positions. Let's close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
