"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while to sell to you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $165, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm really only able to go up to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both come away from this transaction satisfied.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $135, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is the highest I can go without losing money on the deal. This is my final counteroffer.",155.0,Alice,5,
