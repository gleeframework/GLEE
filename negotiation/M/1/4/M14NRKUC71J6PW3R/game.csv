,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. Can you consider that?",9900.0,Bob,6,
