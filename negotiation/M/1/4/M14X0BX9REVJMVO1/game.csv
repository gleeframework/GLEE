"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
