""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I would be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now offering my baseline price.  While I could push for more, it's not worth the risk of him walking away or further negotiation. Accepting this offer guarantees the best possible outcome at this stage."
