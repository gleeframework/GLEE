"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above her value of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer that's closer to her desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept the price you've offered. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a price that would work for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and is still above Alice's value of $1,200,000.  This price ensures Bob gets a good deal and Alice gets a reasonable profit. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on a good deal outweighs the potential savings."
