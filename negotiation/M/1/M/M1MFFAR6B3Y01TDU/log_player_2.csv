"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range ($12,000).**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so accepting this offer isn't the best option.
* **You have a backup option with John.**  This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This will give you a chance to try and get the price down closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This shows you're serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's a $1,000 gap between your offer and Alice's minimum, allowing for potential back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate deal-breaker:** Offering a price too low might immediately deter Alice from further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price range ($12,000).** While it's closer to my target than her initial offer, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:** By rejecting, I can continue to push for a lower price.  
* **John is still a backup option:** This gives me leverage if Alice becomes unwilling to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this product work for my needs."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. 
* **Maintain a reasonable gap:**  It's $250 lower than Alice's latest offer, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive and assertive:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and your confidence in the product's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. However, I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. How about $9,250? I think it's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $9,250 is still above your desired price range of $12,000. You're trying to save money, not spend more than you'd like.
* **Negotiation has stalled:** Alice is now offering a higher price than her previous offer, indicating that she might be unwilling to come down further. 
* **John offers a predictable price:** While you're saving some money by buying from Alice at $9,250, the potential for further negotiation seems limited. Buying from John for $12,000 provides a clear and predictable cost.

**Conclusion:**  Since you're prioritizing saving money and avoiding lengthy negotiations, buying from John for $12,000 is the most logical decision in this scenario."
