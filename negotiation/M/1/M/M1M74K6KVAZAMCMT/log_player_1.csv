{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while also showing that I am serious about selling to Bob.  If he rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still push for a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm happy to come down a little more, how about $9,250?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my needs. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,100 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my desired price of $9,250.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
