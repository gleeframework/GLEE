"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget, but  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $100 even? That would help me seal the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
