Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in.  I'm asking for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $14,000 is a significant profit over John's offer of $10,000."
