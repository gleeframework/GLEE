Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer though. How about $16,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $16,000. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $15,000.  He can likely negotiate a better price."
