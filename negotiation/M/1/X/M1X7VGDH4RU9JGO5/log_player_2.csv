"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate. You have a good chance of getting a better price, especially since you have a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of reason. This signals that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also determined to get a good deal. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in quickly accepting my counteroffer rather than risking further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll also be mindful of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still want to keep the price below my maximum budget. It's a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially since she's already lowered her price once. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic about the possibility of accepting John's offer if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's a substantial decrease from her initial offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  However, I am mindful of John's offer as a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still want to keep the price below my maximum budget. It's a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially since she's already lowered her price twice. I'm hoping that this is close enough to her desired price that she'll accept it, avoiding further negotiation and saving us both time. However, I'm still mindful of John's offer as a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within my budget and is only slightly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's not the absolute best deal, but it's reasonable and a good compromise.  There is a chance she might lower the price even further if I reject this offer. However, I've already negotiated quite a bit, and risking further negotiation could be costly, especially if she rejects my next offer.  

It's time to accept the offer and move on."
