"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to potentially benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
