```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still a good price, but I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still being above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal.  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and I'm confident that I won't get a better price.  $1,050,000 is significantly more than what I'd get from John, and I'm happy to close this deal."
