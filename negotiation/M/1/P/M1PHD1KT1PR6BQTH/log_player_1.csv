"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving space for negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Set a high reference point for the negotiation.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to this initial price to understand his flexibility.
3. **Maintain Control:**  Starting strong gives you more control over the negotiation's direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is quite high. I'm interested but only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  You have a guaranteed offer from John, so there's no need to settle for a price this low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is below what I can accept, I understand there's value in finding common ground. To move things forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  The significant drop from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000 signals a willingness to negotiate but remains above both your minimum and Bob's stated maximum. 
* **Holding Firm:** While closer to a potential deal, the offer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Justification:**  The message connects the price to the product's inherent value, reinforcing your position.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage Counteroffer:** The substantial decrease encourages Bob to respond with a significantly higher offer.
2. **Maintain Value Perception:**  The language emphasizes the product's worth, justifying the higher price point. 
3. **Control the Pace:** You are setting the pace of the negotiation and leading the conversation towards a more agreeable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  While $1,700,000 is closer, it's still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to consider $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), indicating serious interest. However, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have leverage as you have a guaranteed offer from John. Continuing the negotiation is the best strategy to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving closer to a figure that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** A smaller decrease this round ($150,000) shows willingness to negotiate but at a slower pace, indicating you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Above Minimum, Enticing Compromise:**  The offer is now just slightly above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000), making it palatable if Bob is truly committed. 
* **Focus on Value and Fairness:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value while positioning the offer as a mutually beneficial compromise.

This approach aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Resolve:** See if Bob is willing to bridge the remaining gap, given that you've made consecutive concessions.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  By staying slightly above your minimum, you maintain leverage while encouraging a final decision from Bob. 
3. **Avoid Stalemate:**  The smaller concession keeps the negotiation moving and prevents a stalemate at this critical stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal might outweigh the potential reward. 

Here's why accepting is the best option at this point:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 represents a substantial profit, even if it's slightly below your ideal target.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means you receive the payment sooner. Prolonging negotiations delays receiving the funds and could potentially lead to no deal.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's compromise demonstrates goodwill and fosters a positive business relationship for potential future deals.

While there's a chance you could get more, the certainty of a good deal now outweighs the risk of ending up with nothing if Bob walks away."
