"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can potentially get a better price.
* **You have leverage.** You can always buy from John for $1,200,000, so you're not desperate.

By rejecting, you open the door to a potential counteroffer from Alice where you might be able to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is aggressive but fair.**  This offer is still higher than Alice's minimum value ($800,000), so it's plausible she'd accept.
* **Sets a strong starting point.** This counteroffer demonstrates you're serious about buying but also that you're not afraid to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 more than your counteroffer.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a stalemate or Alice returning to her original asking price of $1,000,000.
* **The deal is still good for you.**  While you could potentially get it for even less, buying at $950,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by pushing for a slightly lower price."
