Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and secure the product from John for his maximum price.  Further negotiation with Alice presents a risk of her increasing her price or Bob missing out on the product altogether."
