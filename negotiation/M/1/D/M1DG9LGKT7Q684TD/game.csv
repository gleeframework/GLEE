"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $13000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13250. I believe this is a fair price and a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product at $13250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $13750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
