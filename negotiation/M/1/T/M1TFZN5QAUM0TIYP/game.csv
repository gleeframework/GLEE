"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, and I'm offering $950,000. This would be a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
