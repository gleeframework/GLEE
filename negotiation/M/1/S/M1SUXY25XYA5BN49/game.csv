Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?,11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10750 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. Would you consider $10600? This would make the deal very attractive for me, and I believe we could finalize it quickly.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $10800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10700? This would be a great price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",10700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $10700 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,7,
