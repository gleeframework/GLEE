"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a good starting point but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some wiggle room while still securing a good profit for me. 
* **Framing the offer:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob and frames the price as ""fair"" to encourage acceptance. 

**Strategy:**

This is a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, I get a good deal. If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and adjust my own offers accordingly.  I'm also keeping in mind the safety net of John's offer, which ensures I'll get at least $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still a good deal:** $1,000,000 is above my minimum price and still a significant profit. 
* **More negotiation room:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate.  
* **Gauging Bob's commitment:** I want to see how determined Bob is to get this product. A low counteroffer in the first round might indicate he's not truly invested in the deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer.  This allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to budge. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation goes south."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit closer to my original price.  How about $1,100,000? I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining confidence:** My message reaffirms the product's value and suggests that the price is fair, further incentivizing Bob to accept.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While this offer is significantly higher than John's, I'm still keeping my options open and ensuring I can walk away with a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more conservative approach this round, trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about $950,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is pushing for a lower price:** While his offer is still above my minimum, it's getting closer to John's offer.
* **Time is running out:** We're in the fourth round, and I need to be careful about losing too much time.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of pushing for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll need to be strategic and make sure my counteroffer is attractive enough to keep Bob engaged, but also not so low that I leave too much profit on the table. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between his last offer and my previous counter-offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Time is ticking:** While I'm willing to negotiate further, I'm also acknowledging the limited time we have and pushing for a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring the deal doesn't fall apart. This counter-offer is a calculated risk, and I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the potential of John's offer more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be reasonable, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. How about $900,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to John's:**  While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's also very close to the $800,000 I could get from John. This situation is getting risky.
* **Time is still a factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob.
* **Potential for compromise:** I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm not ready to give up on a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's slightly higher than $900,000. I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away completely, but I'm also trying to maximize my profit. I'll also need to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to come down a little further.  However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about $975,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a smaller gap:** I'm offering a price that's only $75,000 away from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway. This increases the chances of him accepting while still keeping my profit margins relatively high.
* **Urgency with a solution:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach a compromise and close the deal, reminding Bob that time is running out.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm presenting this offer as a fair compromise, suggesting that it benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more assertive approach this round, aiming to close the deal while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. This counteroffer is a final push before I need to seriously consider John's offer. I'll be closely watching Bob's response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but $975,000 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $850,000 or less. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 more than what John is offering. This is a very small difference in profit. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob will continue to push for a lower price, potentially leading to a deal that's even closer to John's offer.
* **Time is running out:** We're in the eighth round, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is growing.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, the risk of further negotiation and the dwindling time remaining make it wiser to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit.  I can't afford to risk losing more rounds and potentially ending up with a deal that's barely better than John's."
