"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $13,000.
* **Alternative:** John's price is $15,000. 

Alice's offer is the best deal available right now, as it's lower than John's price and within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
