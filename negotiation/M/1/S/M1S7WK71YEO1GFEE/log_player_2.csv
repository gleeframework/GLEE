Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $12,800, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000."
