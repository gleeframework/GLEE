Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's worth to me. I'm hoping to get a good price but also acknowledge that Bob might not accept the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. It's not worth selling the product for that price, considering John is willing to buy it for $15,000. I will proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering a price of $15,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price. I believe it's a fair price, but still allows for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll agree.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation."
