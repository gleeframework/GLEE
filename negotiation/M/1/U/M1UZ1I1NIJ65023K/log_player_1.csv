Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Testing the waters:**  A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, you have room to negotiate downwards while still exceeding your minimum price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might outright reject the price, or he might counter with a lower offer."
