"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product but need to stay within my price range.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000 to find a middle ground.  This offer reflects the considerable worth and potential this product holds.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to purchasing this product but need to stay within a strict budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while respecting my financial limitations. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
