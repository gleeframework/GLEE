I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value it holds for you. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget and you to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. I believe it's worth more than that to me, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
