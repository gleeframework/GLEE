Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to close the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $795,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one last offer, and that's $825,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the full $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $825,000.  We've been very close to this number and she's unwilling to budge further.  It's highly likely she'll follow through on her threat to sell to John for the full price.  Rather than risk getting stuck with no deal and having to pay John's full price anyway, it's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,000,000."
