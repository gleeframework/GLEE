"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more significant reduction to $750000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer at $775000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've negotiated for 5 rounds and am getting impatient.  It's time to take the secure offer from John and avoid any further risk."
