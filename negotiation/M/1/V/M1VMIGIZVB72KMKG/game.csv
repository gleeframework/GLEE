"I'm really interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more significant reduction to $750000. Can we meet in the middle again?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to drop my price to $850000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer at $775000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
