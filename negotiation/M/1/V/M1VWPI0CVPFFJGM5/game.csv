"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a stronger business case for the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for me while remaining competitive.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This price would be a more comfortable fit for my budget and would allow me to make a stronger business case for the purchase.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
