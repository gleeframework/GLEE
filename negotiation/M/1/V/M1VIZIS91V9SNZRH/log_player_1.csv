"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold. This strategy aims to close the gap with Bob's offer while keeping the potential for further negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $910,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John at a lower price yet, so I'm going to counteroffer again. I have four rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, as time is running out. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal and get me a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. We are down to the last two rounds and I'm willing to risk it for a slightly higher price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 915000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $915,000.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, and with only one round remaining, this is my last attempt to get a better price."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one.  While I'd love to get more than $890,000, I don't think I'm going to get a better offer from Bob in this final round. It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee at least my minimum price."
