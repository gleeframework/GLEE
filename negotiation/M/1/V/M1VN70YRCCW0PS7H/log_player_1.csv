Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), so she has leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential,"" Alice emphasizes the product's worth, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages a response from Bob, opening the door for further discussion and potential counter-offers."
