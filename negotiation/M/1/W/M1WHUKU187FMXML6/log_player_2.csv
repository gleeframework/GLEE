"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a competitive price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than $1,500,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating further.  There's also the option of buying from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's initial offer is the best strategy for Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum limit, while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite but firm. It acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating Bob's intention to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strategic Value:** A counteroffer that is not too aggressive gives Alice room to accept. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $1,250,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, reflecting the value you've outlined. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to find common ground. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Concession:** While Alice has come down from $1,400,000, $1,350,000 is still above Bob's desired price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. This suggests there's room for further compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  The option to buy from John for $1,200,000 is still on the table, acting as a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

**By rejecting the offer, Bob continues to strive for a better price.**"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land somewhere closer to $1,300,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to close the gap.
* **Focus on Meeting in the Middle:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise, further encouraging Alice to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and creates pressure on Alice to make a decision."
