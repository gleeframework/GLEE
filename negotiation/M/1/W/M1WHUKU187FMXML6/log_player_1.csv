Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
 I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer at this point. I want to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $1,250,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, reflecting the value you've outlined. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to find common ground. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land somewhere closer to $1,300,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer is a good strategy as it's likely we won't get a better deal from Bob in the remaining rounds and I risk losing the sale completely. It's also important to remember that John is always an option if this deal falls through."
