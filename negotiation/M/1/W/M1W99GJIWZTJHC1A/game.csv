"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,900,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,000,000 undervalues it significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter. I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,450,000 is better, it's still a bit rich for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,150,000?  That would make a deal much more doable.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be open to $1,325,000? That's a significant compromise on my initial price, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
