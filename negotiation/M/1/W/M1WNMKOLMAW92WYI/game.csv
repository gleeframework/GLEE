"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $725,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see where you're coming from, the value of this product is truly above that mark. Let's settle this at $850,000 and close this deal.  It's a win-win for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
