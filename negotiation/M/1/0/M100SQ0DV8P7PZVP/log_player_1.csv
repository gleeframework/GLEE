{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for compromise. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting Bob's potential appreciation for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point.  You can likely get closer to your desired value by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $108 for it. Is that a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to your desired price, it's still a little below what you're hoping for.  There's a good chance you can get a bit closer to your goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $109? That way we both get a little closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $106 for the product. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still below your minimum. While you could continue negotiating, you're now getting close to your minimum and you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.  It's likely that you won't get a better offer from Bob and the time spent negotiating could be better spent on other opportunities."
