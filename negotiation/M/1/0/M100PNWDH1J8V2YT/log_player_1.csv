"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This will test the waters and see how eager Bob is to purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer now is the most logical decision to maximize my earnings."
