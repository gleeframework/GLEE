"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a beneficial outcome for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for both of us to gain something from this deal. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
