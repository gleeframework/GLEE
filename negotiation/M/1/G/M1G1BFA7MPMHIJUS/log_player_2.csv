We're still slowly making progress, and Alice is consistently countering.  There's a good chance we can get the price lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $800,000. If we can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Anchor at Alice's value:** We've reached Alice's known product value of $800,000.  This is a strong negotiating position.
* **Signal firmness:**  By stating a ""hard limit,"" we indicate we're unlikely to go higher. 
* **Encourage a deal:** Expressing readiness to close quickly adds incentive for Alice to accept."
