Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $10,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also subtly points out the value proposition. 

This offer allows me to:

* **Maximize profit:** A price of $10,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, allowing me to secure a good profit.
* **Keep negotiations open:** This price is likely to trigger a counteroffer from Bob, giving us an opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **Maintain John as a backup:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiations:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I show Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This strengthens my position in future negotiations. 
* **Preserve John as a backup:** I can still sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,500 is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price.  It also highlights the ""fairness"" of the deal, making it more appealing to Bob.

This approach allows me to:

* **Gain Ground:** I've moved closer to my desired price while still being open to a deal.
* **Signal Flexibility:** I've demonstrated my willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000 if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and might not result in a price that is satisfactory to me. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and allows me to close the deal quickly.

Here's why selling to John is the best option in this scenario:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired profit, which is $12,000.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Negotiating with Bob further will take time and effort, with no guarantee of a successful outcome.
* **Eliminating Risk:**  There's no guarantee that I can convince Bob to go higher. Selling to John eliminates this risk and ensures a guaranteed sale.

By selling to John, I prioritize a certain profit and avoid the uncertainty and potential losses that further negotiations with Bob could bring."
