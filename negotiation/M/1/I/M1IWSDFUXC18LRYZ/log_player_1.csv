Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $120}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $100. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm not willing to sell it to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100, I'll increase the price slightly to try to get closer to the value the product has to me. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $110}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
