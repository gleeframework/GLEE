"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can make a deal.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105? That leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident this product is worth it to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy using the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
