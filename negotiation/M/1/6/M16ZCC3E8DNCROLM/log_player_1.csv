Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer. I also want to leave enough room to potentially make a counteroffer if he gives me a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $100.  This is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and his offer of $90. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but it also gives me some leeway if he decides to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
