Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $95. This is above my minimum price of $80, and I think it's a fair starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel the negotiation is going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $75. It's below my minimum price of $80, and I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $88. This is still above my minimum price of $80, but it's a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $82. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $80 and a better outcome than selling to John for $80. I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement with Bob."
