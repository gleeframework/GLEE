Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's initial offer was low, it shows he's interested. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap and find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's significantly higher than his initial counteroffer. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $8,500 is above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm not making a huge sacrifice. 
* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is a good compromise, and it might be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting close to what I can spend. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed, secure deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, but if he rejects it, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to go as low as $8,000 for this product.  This is a final offer from me, as I have another buyer lined up.  It's a great price for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer to create urgency and pressure.
* **Slight Compromise:** While still above my minimum, this offer shows I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John again emphasizes that I have a viable backup option.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm trying to end the negotiation on a positive note, even though I'm setting a firm price."
