Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but well above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob counters. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum price, I know Bob values the product at $120. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a very fair offer considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our last two offers, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the idea that my counteroffer is reasonable. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** $110 still provides a good profit margin above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you do $108?  That's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gain vs. Risk:**  While I could push for a few more dollars, Bob's latest offer is only $2 less than my counteroffer.  There's a risk he might walk away if I reject this, leaving me with John's offer of $100.
* **Acceptable Profit:**  $108 is still a decent profit above my minimum, and it's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose the sale altogether."
