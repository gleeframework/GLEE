Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming high is key. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you a great deal.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives you a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer."
