"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's significantly more than our budget and even higher than Alice's own valuation. Rejecting this offer is the best way to signal that we're serious buyers but not willing to be taken advantage of."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($8,000) creates room for negotiation and helps us understand Alice's bottom line.  While it's a significant difference from her initial price, it's important to aim low in the beginning. 
* **Respectful Communication:** Maintaining a polite and professional tone is crucial throughout the negotiation. We acknowledge her offer while clearly stating our price limit.

This strategy balances our goal of saving money with the need to engage Alice in a meaningful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved from her initial price, $17,000 is still significantly higher than both our budget and John's offer. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at any cost. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** We're increasing our offer substantially (from $8,000 to $10,000), signaling flexibility and a genuine interest in purchasing the product.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's crucial to keep our offer below $12,000. This ensures we're still negotiating for a price that's better than John's fallback option. 
* **Clear Communication:**  We clearly explain the reasoning behind our counter-offer, emphasizing our desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By striking this balance, we aim to move the negotiation towards a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's meet in the middle - $14,500 and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but $14,500 is still more than John's offer of $12,000. We're getting close to a possible agreement, but it's not time to settle yet.  We can use another counteroffer to try and nudge Alice closer to our acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget further to make this work. How about $11,500?  That's a substantial move on my side and shows how serious I am about buying this from you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Acceptable:** We're making a significant jump from $10,000 to $11,500. This puts us above the midpoint between our last offer and her current one, showing strong movement towards a deal.
* **Staying Competitive:**  While aggressive, $11,500 is still below John's offer and comfortably within our $12,000 limit. This keeps the pressure on Alice while ensuring we're not overpaying.
* **Emphasize Deal Closing:**  By stating our willingness to ""stretch"" and highlighting our commitment to buying from *her*, we're signaling a strong desire to close the deal quickly.

This counteroffer aims to finalize the negotiation in our favor while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $11,500. My final offer is $13,000. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is higher than John's offer of $12,000. While we were able to negotiate down significantly from Alice's initial offer, it makes more financial sense to purchase the product from John at this point."
