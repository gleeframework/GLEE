"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's meet in the middle - $14,500 and we have a deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget further to make this work. How about $11,500?  That's a substantial move on my side and shows how serious I am about buying this from you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $11,500. My final offer is $13,000. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,7,
