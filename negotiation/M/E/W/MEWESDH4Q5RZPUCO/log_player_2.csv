"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still within your budget of $12,000. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product at a price that's favorable to you. While there's a chance you could negotiate even lower, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (or having to buy from John at a higher price) outweighs the potential for further savings."
