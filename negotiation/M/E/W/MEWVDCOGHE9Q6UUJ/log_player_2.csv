"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also higher than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. This means you get a good deal and Alice also makes a profit. It's the best outcome for both parties."
