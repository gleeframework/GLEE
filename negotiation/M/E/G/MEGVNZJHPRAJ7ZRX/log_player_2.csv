You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $8,250. Buying from John guarantees you get the product without further negotiation and at a price you know is acceptable."
