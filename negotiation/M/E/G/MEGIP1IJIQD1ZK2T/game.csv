"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $105 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
