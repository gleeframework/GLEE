"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my target. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $975000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",975000.0,Alice,3,
