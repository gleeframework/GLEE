Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so there's space for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** By offering a price slightly lower than what you know it's worth to Bob, you show flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum price, it leaves no room for profit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price point.  It's also worth considering that Bob is already demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $10,750 is the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  Emphasizing a ""good deal"" for Bob can make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Reiteration of your goal:**  Mentioning the need to make a ""reasonable profit"" subtly reminds Bob of the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $10500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** While it's not your ideal price, $10,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, guaranteeing you a profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that if you reject Bob's offer, you might not be able to get a higher price in the next round, and you could end up selling to John for your minimum.
* **Moving forward:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and move on, rather than continuing to negotiate with the potential for a less favorable outcome."
