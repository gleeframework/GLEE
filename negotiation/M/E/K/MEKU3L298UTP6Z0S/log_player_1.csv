Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not sure if I can get Bob to budge further, but I'm willing to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  Would you consider $11,750? It's a small step, but it could be the final one to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $11,750 isn't enough for me.  I'm concerned that we're getting into a stalemate, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  John is a guaranteed buyer, and I'm happy with this outcome."
