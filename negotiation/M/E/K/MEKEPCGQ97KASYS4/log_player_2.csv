Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. He should proceed to make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you consider $16,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.

While $16,000 is lower than Alice's original offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject and try to negotiate further."
