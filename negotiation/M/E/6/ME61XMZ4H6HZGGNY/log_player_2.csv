"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80. For this round, I'm offering it to you for $95. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at an excellent price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is less than your maximum budget of $120, it's still a bit high.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** We're trying to save as much money as possible, so we're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Be polite:**  It's important to maintain a positive tone, even when rejecting an offer. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  We're not simply rejecting her offer outright, but instead, we're stating our willingness to negotiate and offering a concrete counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to meet you halfway. How about I offer the product to you for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is within my acceptable range. While I'd still prefer to pay $80,  it's likely that further negotiation will take us closer to my desired price. However,  accepting her offer ensures I get the product without risking losing it to another buyer.  There's always the chance that I can get a better deal in later rounds, but it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether."
