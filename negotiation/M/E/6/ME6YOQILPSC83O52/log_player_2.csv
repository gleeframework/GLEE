"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and unique features, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant significance to me. However, understanding its potential worth to you, I am offering it at a special price of $11,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its intrinsic value of $12,000 to you. I believe this offer presents a favorable transaction for both parties. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
