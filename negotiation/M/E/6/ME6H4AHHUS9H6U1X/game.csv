"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12000, which is the lowest price I can go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to keep it under $9000. Would you consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this under $10000. How about $9800?  It's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.",9800.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering it to you for $10500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $10500 is still more than I can afford. If you are truly serious about a deal, I am willing to go up to $10000. That's my absolute final offer.",10000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,10000.0
"I've already offered you the lowest price I'm willing to consider, Bob, and you've already met me at $10000. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at your final offer, so I'm accepting your offer of $10000. I'll sell the product to you for $10000.",10000.0,Alice,9,,
