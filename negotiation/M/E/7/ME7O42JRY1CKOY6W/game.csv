"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, given its unique value. This is a significant amount and reflects my sincere interest in acquiring it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product, which reflects its value and demonstrates my strong interest. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,5,
