"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to come in lower.  Would you consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $13000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit higher than your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
