"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $110, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $110. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $90. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a purchase.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $100, Bob. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to sweeten the deal. I'll meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're interested, this is my final offer.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the slight discount, Alice, but $99 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer of $92. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a purchase.",92.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $100, Bob. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'll make one last offer to you, and it's at my minimum price of $100. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at the end of the negotiation, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $90. I'd like to make one final offer of $90. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll make a purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80.",90.0,Bob,10,
