"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
