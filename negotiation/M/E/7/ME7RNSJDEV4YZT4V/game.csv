"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you for $15,000. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the exclusive features and the high demand for this item. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay a fair price for this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price of $12,000? This still allows us to cover costs and maintain profitability, while acknowledging your financial constraints. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you some profit while still being within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I'd like to propose a price of $10,800 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and should allow for a satisfactory transaction for both parties. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the sale.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. To be honest, I can only go as high as $10,500. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm happy to move forward with the purchase. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10500.0,Bob,6,
