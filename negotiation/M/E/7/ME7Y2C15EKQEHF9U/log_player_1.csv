Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle above our minimum ($800,000).
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while ensuring the sale doesn't fall through."
