Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140?

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on a price well above our $100 limit.  It's unlikely we'll negotiate her down to an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. Cutting our losses and buying from John guarantees we get the product at our target price."
