"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to compromise, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $132.50.  It's close, but I need to be a bit closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $134? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $133.25?",133.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to an agreement. I understand your budget constraints, but $133.25 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $133.62. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",133.62,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $133.62 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $133.31?",133.31,Bob,8,
