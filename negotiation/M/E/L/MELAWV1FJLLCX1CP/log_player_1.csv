"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value and the ""great deal"" to make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I ask for Bob's opinion to signal that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth at least $120 to me. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price than my initial offer, but there is still room for me to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have ten rounds, and I believe there's a chance I can get Bob to pay closer to my initial $140 offer. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to compromise, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm using a counter-offer to show flexibility while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** Suggesting $135 positions me as reasonable and willing to compromise, but it's still closer to my initial offer than Bob's.
* **Framing:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price and focus on mutual needs to increase the likelihood of acceptance.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is profitable for me while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer of $140. While $132.50 is above my minimum of $120, it's not ideal.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a deal. I believe I can still push for a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation. I have several rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit.

**Next steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above his current offer, hoping to find a middle ground closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $132.50.  It's close, but I need to be a bit closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $134? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic counter-offer:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still holding firm on getting a price above $132.50.
* **Framing for closure:**  I emphasize a ""fair compromise"" and the opportunity to ""finally close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on the middle ground:** I continue to aim for a price that is halfway between our last two offers. 

This strategy aims to close the deal while maximizing my profit, while also being mindful of the limited rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $133.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** While $133.25 is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential for a better deal.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have four rounds remaining, and I don't want to settle too early, especially with the risk of John's offer looming.

**Next steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my last offer but still higher than Bob's current offer, hoping to find a compromise in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're very close to an agreement. I understand your budget constraints, but $133.25 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $133.62. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 133.62}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push for a higher price:** I'm making a final counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm using a price that is halfway between our previous offers to show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Framing for closure:** I'm reiterating that we are close to an agreement and emphasizing the need to finalize the deal.
* **Limited rounds:** I'm conscious of the limited rounds remaining and want to make sure I'm getting as close to my desired price as possible. 

This strategy aims to close the deal while getting as much money as possible for the product, considering the time constraint and the potential of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $133.62 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $133.31? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133.31. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133.31
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and having to settle for John's offer at $120 is significant.
* **Slight increase:** Bob's offer is only slightly below my previous counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my desired price.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better offer in the remaining round. Accepting this offer ensures I get a price above my minimum and closes the deal.

**Next steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
