Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point, but if Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's last offer. I believe this price is a good compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer but it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price requirement."
