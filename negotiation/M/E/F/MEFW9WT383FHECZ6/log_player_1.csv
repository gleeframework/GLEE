Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $120 would be a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob seems firmly set at $120.  It's unlikely he'll go higher, and I have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
