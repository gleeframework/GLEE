Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob even values the product for. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering it at $150,  even if Bob negotiates you down, you're still likely to get a price higher than your $100 minimum and John's offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about how much he might be willing to pay."
