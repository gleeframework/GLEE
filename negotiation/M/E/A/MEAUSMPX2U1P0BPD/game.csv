"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $11,500? I'm serious about buying the product if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price!",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is close, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,500? This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product!",13000.0,Alice,7,
