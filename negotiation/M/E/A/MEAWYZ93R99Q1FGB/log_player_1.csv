{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above what Bob is willing to pay, but it still allows room for negotiation. It also shows you are willing to negotiate but are not giving away the product for less than you need.  If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly in the next round. Remember, you have the option to sell to John at any time if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I am willing to negotiate, but I cannot drop the price that significantly. I will make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a good compromise, and it still allows you to get the product at a price that's significantly lower than what I would get from other buyers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,000, which would be $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. $11,500 is too low for me. I'll make a final counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $11,500 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 12000}
