"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a good compromise, and it still allows you to get the product at a price that's significantly lower than what I would get from other buyers. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,000, which would be $11,500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $11,500 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",12000.0,Alice,5,
