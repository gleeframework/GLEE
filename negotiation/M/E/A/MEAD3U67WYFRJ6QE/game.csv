"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $175 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $190.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I should consider other options. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I can offer it to you for $220.
