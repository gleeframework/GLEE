"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close the deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $107.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is just not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's get this done!",112.5,Alice,5,
