"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique product with immense potential. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1350000. This takes into account the value of the product and the potential for its future success. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1250000 is closer to where I need to be.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. I'm confident this is a win-win solution for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
