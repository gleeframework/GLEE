This offer is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  It shows you're willing to deal, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $14,750? I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,750 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll sell to John for $15,000. It's guaranteed money and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
