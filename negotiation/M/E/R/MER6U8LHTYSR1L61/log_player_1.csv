I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed $800,000 from John, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 

By offering a higher price, I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential higher valuation of the product. However, if Bob rejects the offer, I can still guarantee a sale to John for $800,000, so there's limited downside to this strategy."
