"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I think you'll really appreciate its features. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his desired price. He should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is the absolute maximum I can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise at $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's likely that further negotiation will lead to a similar stalemate.  John's offer of $10,000 is the best option for Bob."
