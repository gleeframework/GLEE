"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is the absolute maximum I can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise at $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal!",18000.0,Alice,5,
