Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You are still hoping to save more money.  You can continue to negotiate by making another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $1,200,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth one more counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit.  You can make a counteroffer that splits the difference between your last offer and Alice's current offer, hoping to secure a deal within your budget."
