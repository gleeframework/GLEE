"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $150.  Since Alice's initial offer is $150, there's no potential upside to negotiating with her.  It's always beneficial to secure the guaranteed deal if it's at your maximum price point."
