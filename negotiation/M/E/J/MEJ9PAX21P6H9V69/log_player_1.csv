"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price, $1,200,000. This is the maximum value for me, and I know Bob won't accept it right away, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I'm confident that John will be a reliable backup if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, $950,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can still get closer to my target. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that gives me a decent profit. I've dropped to $1,050,000, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider my options carefully in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  There are still a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get as much as possible. $1,025,000 is a compromise that is still a decent profit for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I might have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum, but not quite there. This is a risky move, but I'm confident John is a reliable buyer, and I'll be able to secure my desired price."
