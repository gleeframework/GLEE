"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  $11,500 is a good price, better than buying from John and likely the best you'll get from Alice."
