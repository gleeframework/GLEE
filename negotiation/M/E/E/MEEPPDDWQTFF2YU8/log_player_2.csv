"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,200,000, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000 but it's getting closer.  Continuing to counteroffer risks Alice walking away from the deal and forcing Bob to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
