Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $1,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Fair Offer:** While still significantly higher than my minimum, this price is still below the estimated value of $1,500,000 to Bob. This makes the offer appealing to him.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and highlights the value of the product for Bob. This creates a more collaborative atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* I will observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob recognizes the value, his offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Potential for compromise:**  By making a counteroffer, I can demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.
* I will consider factors like Bob's perceived urgency and my own timeline to determine the best counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $1,100,000 is still a good deal considering its worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message is positive and reiterates my willingness to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* Depending on his reaction, I'll either accept his offer if it's acceptable or prepare to make a further counteroffer.
* I'll keep in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $1,000,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no financial incentive to continue negotiating.
* **No Room for Improvement:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a strong chance I'll end up selling to John for the same price.
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a lower price, or even a loss of the sale altogether.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. 
* It's important to document the agreement and ensure a smooth transaction."
