Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also implying a sense of fairness. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While I could start at a higher price, it risks immediate rejection.  $1,400,000 gives me a substantial profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. If Bob doesn't accept, I can always go to John. 
* **Starting high:** Even though Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high allows for a more advantageous negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Loss aversion:** Accepting Bob's offer would lead to a substantial financial loss compared to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have a strong negotiating position with John as a backup buyer. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for better outcome:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I have the chance to secure a more favorable deal, even if it means potentially losing the sale to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $1,000,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while reiterating my own value assessment.  I frame the $1,000,000 as a good deal for both of us. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise to keep the negotiation alive, but not at a price that significantly diminishes my profit.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps my backup option with John in play, allowing me to potentially secure a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Moderate price:** $1,000,000 is a substantial profit for me, but it's still lower than my initial offer, signaling a genuine willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it still falls significantly short of my goal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to try to reach a more favorable outcome.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and can continue to push for a higher price. 
* **Backup plan:** I still have John as a backup buyer, who is willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal.
* **Minimizing losses:** While $750,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  To show you my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it reflects the value of the product and the importance of this deal to me.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $900,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer of $1,000,000 but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's concerns while emphasizing the value of the product and my commitment to finding a mutually acceptable solution. I frame the offer as a ""significant compromise"" to show my willingness to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual compromise:** I'm steadily reducing my price while still maintaining a significant profit margin. This demonstrates a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Final push:** This counteroffer is likely my last one before I resort to selling to John.  I'm hoping to push Bob towards a more favorable price.
* **Potential for acceptance:** $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price while still exceeding his offer, potentially making it more appealing."
