Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we know Bob only values the product at $120, starting at your minimum acceptable price ($150) makes sense for a couple of reasons:

* **Anchoring:**  Starting high sets an ""anchor"" for the negotiation. Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, it frames the subsequent discussion.
* **Potential for higher profit:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $120, especially if he doesn't know your absolute bottom line.
* **John as backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk in starting the negotiation high. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate down slightly. You can always move closer to $120, knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
