"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
