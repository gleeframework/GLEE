Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's highly valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $20 markup (from $100 to $120) is a reasonable starting point. It allows for some negotiation room if Bob counters.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the perceived value of the product. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, starting at a higher price point gives you a better chance of maximizing your potential profit."
