Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $15.
* **It's below John's offer:**  You're incentivized to negotiate with Bob, as you can always get $120 from John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum profit threshold of $120.  You have a guaranteed $120 from John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is still below your minimum profit threshold.  You've already gone down from your initial offer of $115 to $110, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go much higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $120 from John, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
