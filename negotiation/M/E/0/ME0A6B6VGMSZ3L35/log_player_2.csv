"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your budget.  You should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. You can likely get it for closer to your maximum budget with further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $850000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your budget and you have already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. It's more efficient to buy from John for $800,000 and save the time and energy of further negotiation."
