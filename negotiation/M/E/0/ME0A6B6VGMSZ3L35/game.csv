"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $850000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
