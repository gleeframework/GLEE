# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell."
