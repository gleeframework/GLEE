"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum of $80.  I'm confident I can close the deal with Bob, but if he rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $120 I initially offered. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum of $80.  Hopefully, this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still too far from my desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $105. This demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still staying above my minimum price.  With only a few rounds left, I want to make sure we reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still not meeting my minimum target.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my previous offer, hoping to close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm making a final concession by lowering my price to $100. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I want to ensure we reach an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to consider selling to John as it is getting close to the end of the negotiation."
