"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but significantly below my minimum. This should leave room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm not giving away too much right away. I'm optimistic and positive in my message, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm aiming for a higher price.  $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm confident in my product's value and willing to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $9,500 to make this deal work.  This is still a great value considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 
I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I initially aimed for a higher price,  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and a significant improvement over his previous offer.  The negotiation is taking longer than expected, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing it entirely."
