Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth in the market. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation. It also establishes the product as potentially highly sought after.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""true worth in the market"" are used to subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind at a higher level than his initial valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion.  Alice doesn't want to scare Bob off entirely, but rather engage him in a potential negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** While not provided, real-world negotiations often involve researching comparable products or market values. If Alice had access to such information and it supported an even higher price, her offer could be adjusted accordingly.
* **Bob's Personality:**  Knowing something about Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive) could influence how Alice structures her initial offer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice is under time pressure to sell, she might be more inclined to propose a lower, more immediately appealing price."
