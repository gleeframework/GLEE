"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet your specific needs and exceed your expectations. This product is not just an item; it's a solution tailored to enhance your experience significantly. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, we believe its true worth is $12,000. However, to make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of bringing this product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's message is enticing, $9,500 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. You'll save the most money by going with John."
