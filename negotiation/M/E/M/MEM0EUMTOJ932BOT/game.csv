"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and honesty about your budget constraints. I understand your position, but $800,000 is considerably below the market value of this product.  To move this forward, I could consider coming down to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant discount on my end, reflecting my willingness to find a solution for us both.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position and appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump, I'm willing to accept $1,125,000 as a final offer to avoid further negotiation. This price represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you've made a significant concession with your last offer, and I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,125,000 is still above my budget.  To reach a final agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
