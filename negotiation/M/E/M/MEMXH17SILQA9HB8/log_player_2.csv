Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $8800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

While I'd prefer to get it for $8,750, Alice is getting closer to my price.  At $8,800, I'm saving $1,200 compared to buying from John, so it's a good deal for me."
