Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. My asking price is $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't need to go below that price.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Bob in a good position:** While the price is high, it still leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer and feel like he got a deal if you negotiate down even slightly."
