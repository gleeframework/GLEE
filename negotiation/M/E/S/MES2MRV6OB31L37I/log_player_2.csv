"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not smart to accept Alice's offer as it's way above your budget. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This counteroffer sets your maximum price point and gives Alice room to negotiate if she's willing to sell for a bit more than your ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're willing to pay more than your initial offer but still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting close. You've already rejected multiple offers and it's possible she won't budge further.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise to avoid the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and possibly getting stuck buying from John for $8,000."
