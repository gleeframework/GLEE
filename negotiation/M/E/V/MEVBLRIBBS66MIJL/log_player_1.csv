I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. This also shows him that I value the product and am confident in its worth.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is still a decent amount, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum valuation. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further and I don't want to risk a protracted negotiation that might end up with a lower price. John is a sure thing, and I'm happy to accept the $1,500,000."
