"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to secure a price as close to my desired $1,200,000 as possible while remaining open to a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, there is potential for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that brings him closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a secure option, but I'm still hopeful of reaching a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to incentivize him to close the deal.
* **Seeking a win-win:** Emphasizing ""finding a solution that benefits us both"" emphasizes collaboration and a desire for a fair deal. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer, while still retaining a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:** There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher. He's clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in the following rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap further while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'll also emphasize the urgency of finalizing the deal, reminding Bob that there are limited rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation window, and I need to consider other options. To move forward, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlighting limited time:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that time is running out, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Compromising further:**  I'm reducing my price again, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm positioning $975,000 as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties.
* **Encouraging finalization:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while still presenting a good deal for him. I'm hopeful that the urgency and the perceived fairness will lead to a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to reach a deal, but $975,000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise that gives you a fair price while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $925,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I need to maintain my leverage to secure a better deal.
* **John is a viable option:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a secure alternative, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price significantly lower than that.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap further while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll also reiterate the urgency of finalizing the deal, as the remaining rounds are limited."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $925,000 is still too low. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasizing limited time:**  I'm using phrases like ""running out of time"" and ""final offer"" to increase urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm explicitly calling this my ""final offer"" to show seriousness and discourage further bargaining.
* **Fair compromise:** I'm framing the $950,000 price as a fair compromise that allows both parties to find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to accept the offer, as he has shown a willingness to negotiate and the remaining time is limited. The offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a backup option if negotiations fail."
