"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation window, and I need to consider other options. To move forward, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to reach a deal, but $975,000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise that gives you a fair price while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $925,000 is still too low. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,7,
