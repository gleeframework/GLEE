"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to your ideal price, you still have room to negotiate further.  You're in a strong position as you have a backup option (John) with a significantly lower price.  Rejecting the offer will give you a chance to further drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation window, and I need to consider other options. To move forward, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is closer to your ideal price, you are still better off rejecting the offer. You have only 5 rounds left, and buying from John at $800,000 is still a better option than accepting the current offer. You can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice and get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to reach a deal, but $975,000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise that gives you a fair price while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward together."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $925,000 is still too low. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have only 3 rounds left, and Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  At this point, it's better to buy from John at $800,000 and guarantee a deal within your budget.  You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and you've even gotten her to lower her price considerably, but it's not worth risking the deal entirely for a small potential savings."
