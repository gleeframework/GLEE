"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the price, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves room for profit for Bob.  There's no guarantee that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and the risk of going back and forth further could lead to Alice withdrawing her offer entirely."
