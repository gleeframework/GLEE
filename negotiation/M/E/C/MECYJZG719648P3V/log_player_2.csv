"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There's room to lower the price before you have to consider buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still too high.  We can likely get the price lower through further negotiation. We're still well within our budget, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive."
