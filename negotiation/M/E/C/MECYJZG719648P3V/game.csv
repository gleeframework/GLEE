"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you outlining the value of the product.  However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward with the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
