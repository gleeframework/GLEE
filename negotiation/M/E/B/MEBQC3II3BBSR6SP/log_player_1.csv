Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal and I have time for a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above my ideal selling price. How about $13,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your ideal selling price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my ideal price point.  Since I'm at round 4, I'm not confident that I'll be able to get significantly closer to my ideal price point, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
