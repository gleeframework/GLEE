"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a fair price and I'll still be able to get a good value for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $15,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is below that. It's better to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as there's still room for a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below Alice's minimum price, and she has already made two counteroffers. It's likely that Bob is unwilling to go higher, and it's not worth spending more rounds trying to negotiate with him. Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees Alice the best outcome."
