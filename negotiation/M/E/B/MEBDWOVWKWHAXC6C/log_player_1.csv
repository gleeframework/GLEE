Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $100.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** My goal is to maximize profit. While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, getting more from Bob is ideal.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $80. I need to offer a price lower than his valuation to entice him.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $100 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can still potentially sell for more than my minimum ($150).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
