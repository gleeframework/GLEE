"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still potentially get a better deal from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While you can buy from John for $15,000, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value for the product ($8,000). This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further while still allowing for potential profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for you.  It's lower than her initial offer and significantly lower than the price John is offering.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
