I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair starting point, giving Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than $1,200,000 for the product, as it's worth that amount to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully it will be more appealing to Bob than his last offer. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
