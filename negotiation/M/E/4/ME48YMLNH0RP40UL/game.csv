"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This price is within my budget, and it represents a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, however,  $850,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it can bring. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can realistically pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a substantial savings for you compared to your initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000 as a final attempt to make this work. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm offering a final price of $975,000. This represents a considerable discount from your initial offer and is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
