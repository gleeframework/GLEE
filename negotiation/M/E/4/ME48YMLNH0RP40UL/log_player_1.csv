"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and slightly below our minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message uses soft language (""significant value,"" ""careful consideration"") to subtly justify the high price without revealing our bottom line.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate while keeping our options open for John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This price is within my budget, and it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We're still in the early rounds. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about a higher price and opens the door for further negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** We have the security of John's offer, allowing us to confidently reject low offers and aim higher with Bob.

We'll use the next round to try and bring Bob closer to a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, however,  $850,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it can bring. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price by $50,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The new price is still considerably higher than Bob's stated value, leaving room for him to potentially move closer to our range.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and our desire for a ""fair deal,"" subtly reinforcing our position without being overly aggressive. 

We'll continue to evaluate Bob's responses and adjust our approach accordingly while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can realistically pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a substantial savings for you compared to your initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Unacceptable:** Bob has increased his offer, signaling his interest, but $950,000 is still significantly below our $1,200,000 walk-away point.
* **Negotiating Power:** We have John's offer as a strong alternative, giving us leverage to hold firm on our price. Accepting now would leave a substantial sum on the table.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With six rounds left, we have time for a few more counteroffers to try and close the gap.

We'll use the next round to make a smaller concession, demonstrating our willingness to deal but also signaling that we're getting closer to our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000 as a final attempt to make this work. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We decrease our offer by $25,000, a smaller amount than our previous concession. This shows we're getting closer to our limit.
* **""Final Attempt"" Language:** By phrasing this as a ""final attempt,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to respond more decisively. 
* **Emphasize Value and Acknowledgement:** We reiterate the product's value while acknowledging Bob's efforts. This aims to maintain a positive tone despite the firm stance.

This approach allows us to test Bob's true willingness to pay while keeping John's offer as a viable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm offering a final price of $975,000. This represents a considerable discount from your initial offer and is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still substantially below our minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Stalled Negotiations:** While Bob has shown some movement, his increases have been relatively small. His ""final price"" statement suggests he's unlikely to move significantly closer to our target.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money. 

At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
