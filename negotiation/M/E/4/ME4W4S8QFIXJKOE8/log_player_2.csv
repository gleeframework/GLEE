"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe could be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident that its worth to you exceeds $800000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true potential. I'm asking for $900000. This price reflects a significant discount from what I believe it's truly worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
