Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer that gives Bob a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high and be willing to negotiate, as Bob likely won't accept this first offer. I am confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 through strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my target price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price and get closer to $1,200,000. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to raise the price a bit, to $975,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, especially considering his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $960,000 is quite close. I'm concerned that continuing the negotiation might result in a lower offer from Bob or lead to a deadlock. Accepting this offer ensures a sale that's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000."
