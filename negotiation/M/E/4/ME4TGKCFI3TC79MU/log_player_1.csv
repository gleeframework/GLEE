While it's less than I hoped for, accepting Bob's offer at $915,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $915,000 is still a significant profit, even though it's below John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to haggle might frustrate Bob, jeopardizing the deal entirely."
