"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair offer.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. It's a fair price that should make both of us happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer, Alice.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
