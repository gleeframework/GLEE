Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value, but it's not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately. I want to see if he's interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I think I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $145.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's only slightly less than my counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John. It's in my best interest to accept and finalize the deal."
