"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  To be totally transparent, I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
