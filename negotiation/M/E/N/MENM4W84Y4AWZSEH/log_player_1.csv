Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  It's above Bob's perceived value but not ridiculously high. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""special price"") might make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
