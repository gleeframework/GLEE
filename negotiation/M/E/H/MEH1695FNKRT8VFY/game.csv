"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but given my budget constraints, I am looking to purchase the product for a maximum of $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. While $12000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $18000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $18000. I am willing to offer $15000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a satisfactory agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
