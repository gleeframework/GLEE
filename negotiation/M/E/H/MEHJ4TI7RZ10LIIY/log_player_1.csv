Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting $200,000 more than your backup offer from John.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  Bob still saves $200,000 compared to his own valuation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of a successful deal while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
