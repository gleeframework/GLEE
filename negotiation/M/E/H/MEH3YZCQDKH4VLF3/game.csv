"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit far off.  Would you consider $9,250?  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
