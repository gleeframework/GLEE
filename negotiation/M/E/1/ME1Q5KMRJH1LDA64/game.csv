"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. This product is worth quite a bit to me,  but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  Let's find a way to make this work.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $1,450,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay closer to $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's compromise at $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?  That's a firm offer from me, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
