"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be happy to purchase the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
