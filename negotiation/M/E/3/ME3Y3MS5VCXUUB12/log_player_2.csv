You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still potential for a better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is  incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. Offering $710,000 is a good middle ground, closer to Alice's last offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice has come down to $720,000, which is a good price.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility that Alice will walk away or raise the price.  Accepting Alice's offer at this point secures a good deal and avoids further risk."
