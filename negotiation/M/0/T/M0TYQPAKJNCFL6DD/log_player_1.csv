{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,450,000 is below Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate while still making a profit. 

This offer is likely to spark a negotiation, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to your ideal. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer or consider selling to John."
