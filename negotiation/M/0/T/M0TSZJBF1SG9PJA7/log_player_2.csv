"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, but it's still worth seeing if he can get an even lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $875,000 is a great price for Bob. It's a good compromise and saves him a considerable amount of money. While further negotiation could potentially save a few more dollars, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
