Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $9,500 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that if Bob declines, you have other options (which you do with John).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid resorting to selling to John."
