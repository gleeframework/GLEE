"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $92 is just not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference at $96?  I'm really trying to make this deal work, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $94, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",94.0,Bob,6,
