This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation, but significantly below your minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

While $92 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a price closer to my target."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $94, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.

You have three options:

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I've made several concessions and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price too far below my target. John is offering a significantly better deal, and I'm going to accept his offer."
