# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget of $1,200,000 and is a good deal, considering the product's value to Alice is $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to save $25,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation could potentially save you more, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
