"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
