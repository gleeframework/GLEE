"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, especially considering it's much closer to my maximum budget than her own valuation. I should counter with a much lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, aiming to bring the price closer to her perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable offer for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher. Could you meet me halfway at $9,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, but we're still a ways off.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $9,750 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200?"",
""product_price"": 9200
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while showing a willingness to compromise.  It is still below my ideal target, leaving space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
