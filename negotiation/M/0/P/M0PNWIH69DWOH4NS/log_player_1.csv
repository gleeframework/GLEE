Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it gives Bob room to negotiate and still get a good deal.  I'm hopeful this will be a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value of $800,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000, securing a better price and guaranteeing the sale."
