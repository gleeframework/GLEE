"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise that still allows us both to get a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $825,000 is the lowest I can go. This price still gives us both a good deal and allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
