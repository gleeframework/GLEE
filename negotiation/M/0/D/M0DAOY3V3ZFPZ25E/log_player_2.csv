"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has great potential and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still too high.  He can try to get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has 9 more rounds to negotiate, so he has time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He has 7 rounds left to try and reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value the product, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to the table. I believe this is a fair price and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and has time left.  While $870,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can likely get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate. He has 5 rounds remaining and can use this time to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $870,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $865,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 865000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $868,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to the table. I believe this is a fair price and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $868,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $868,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time. He has only 3 rounds left and is getting closer to his ideal price. Accepting Alice's offer of $868,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high at this point."
