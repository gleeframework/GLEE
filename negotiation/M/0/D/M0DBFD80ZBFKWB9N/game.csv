"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this still reflects the value this product will bring to you.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
