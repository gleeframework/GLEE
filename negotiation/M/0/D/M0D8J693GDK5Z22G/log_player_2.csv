"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no need to rush into the first offer, and Bob has 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save money and  is trying to find a middle ground.  By offering $90, he's showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making it more likely that she'll counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Since there are still rounds left, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  He has the option of buying from John for $80, so he's not pressured to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If we can agree on that, I'd be happy to purchase the product from you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing continued negotiation by only increasing his offer by a small amount. He's still below his maximum budget of $80 but is demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and creates an opportunity for Alice to consider a final deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $98. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  At this point, the negotiation is getting more difficult.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $80, it's strategically better to stop the negotiation with Alice and secure the product for a lower price."
