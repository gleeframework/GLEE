"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've given this matter careful consideration and I'm willing to go up to $825000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions and I believe it's the best I can offer within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit shy of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $850000 is still too low, so I'm going to try to meet you halfway from your last offer. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I need you to meet me at $875000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you at $862500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope you find this offer acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",862500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $862500, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $862500, but I need you to meet me at $900000. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, and I'm starting to think that selling to John for $800000 might be a better option for me.",900000.0,Alice,7,
