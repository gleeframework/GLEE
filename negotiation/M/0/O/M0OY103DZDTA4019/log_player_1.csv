Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  The offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to lower the price if Bob counters, while still ensuring you profit.
* **It's a starting point:** It establishes the negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.

By starting with this offer, I can assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price for myself.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $15,000 because there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:** It meets Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **It's still above my minimum:** This ensures I get a reasonable profit.
* **It's clear and concise:** This avoids confusion and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, as it represents a good compromise and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $15,000, $13,000 is a decent deal considering Bob's stubbornness. It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to him entirely.  I'll take the $13,000 and move on to other opportunities."
