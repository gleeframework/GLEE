"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he also wants to show Alice he's serious about buying the product. Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a substantial reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price is now only $75,000 more than what Bob can get from John. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and securing the product, as further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might increase her price or Bob might run out of rounds."
