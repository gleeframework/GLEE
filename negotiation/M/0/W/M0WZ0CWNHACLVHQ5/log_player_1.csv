"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing confidence:**  A strong opening price shows confidence in the product's value.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  I'm not aiming for the full $12,000 right away, as this could scare Bob off. 

I'm hoping to get a deal with Bob within these 10 rounds, but I'm aware I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, he's clearly interested and willing to negotiate. This indicates we can potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time for a counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can bridge the gap.

I'm hoping to achieve a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds, but will remain prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  That would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us to encourage acceptance.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, but leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary. I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still aiming to stay within my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between your last offer and mine? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob's offer is still low, he's showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which suggests we can potentially find common ground.
* **Time for another counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired amount, but still leaves some room for negotiation to ensure a win-win outcome.

I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob soon, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating and will keep the option to sell to John in mind."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm continuing to show a willingness to compromise, moving halfway between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and to highlight the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Getting closer to my minimum:**  $10,750 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed. I'm mindful of the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I believe $10,500 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation continues:**  Despite repeated rejections, Bob is persistent and still willing to negotiate, suggesting there's still room for improvement.
* **Counteroffer to close the gap:** I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired amount, but still leaves some room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 

I have a few rounds left and the option to sell to John. However, I'm still hopeful that I can reach a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're sticking to $10,500.  Let's try to split the difference one last time. How about $11,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a final attempt to meet in the middle, offering $11,000 which is the average of my last offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm stressing ""good compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make it easier for him to accept. 
* **Few Rounds Left:** With limited rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a deal that's close to my minimum. 

I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough to close the deal with Bob. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiation continues to stall."
