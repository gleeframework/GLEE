"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us! I know you're interested, and this price allows for a good profit margin for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me there.",950000.0,Bob,4,
