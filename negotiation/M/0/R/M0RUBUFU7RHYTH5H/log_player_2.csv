# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $695,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $710,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to go below $700,000. Her 'compromises' are consistently pushing the price higher.  At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap significantly enough to justify the risk of losing the $1,000,000 backup option with John."
