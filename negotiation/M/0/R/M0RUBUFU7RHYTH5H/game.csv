"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price that's a bit more comfortable for me. How about we bring it down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $725,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
