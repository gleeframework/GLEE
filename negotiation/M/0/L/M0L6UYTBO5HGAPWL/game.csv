"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
