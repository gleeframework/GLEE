"Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more than my initial asking price. To make this move quickly, I'm willing to offer it to you at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential return on your investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value it brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair return for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer is simply too far from what I consider fair value. I've received a very compelling offer from another buyer, and frankly, I'm close to accepting. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer. If you can meet me at $1,600,000, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with the other offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about buying this product at the right price.  My absolute limit is $800,000. If you're willing to accept this, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I wish you the best with the other offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
