"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more than my initial asking price. To make this move quickly, I'm willing to offer it to you at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the maximum profit. Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, we aim to anchor his perception of the price higher. 
* **Urgency and Confidence:**  Mentioning a ""quick"" deal and expressing confidence in the offer's fairness creates a sense of urgency and  discourages low counteroffers. 

**Strategy:**

This first offer is about setting the stage for negotiation. We want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his willingness to pay. We'll adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below even his own perceived value of the product ($800,000).  This indicates he has room to move significantly. We are far from a reasonable negotiation range, and accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. 

**Strategy:**

We need to bring Bob closer to a realistic price point. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're serious about negotiating a fair deal and not willing to settle for a lowball offer. We will counter with a price that acknowledges his offer but moves significantly closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value it brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair return for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We want to keep the negotiation moving, so we acknowledge his offer while making it clear it's too low.
* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Target:**  Dropping to $1,900,000 is a substantial move from our initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it's still well above both his offer and our minimum, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value and Fairness:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value while framing the counteroffer as a ""fair"" deal for both parties. This aims to shift the focus from simply haggling over price to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

We've made a significant concession to encourage Bob to engage more seriously. We'll observe his response to see if he's willing to move closer to our range. We still have the option of going to John if Bob continues to lowball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still substantially lower than both our target and the product's value to him. Accepting at $750,000 would be leaving significant profit on the table. 

**Strategy:**

We need to demonstrate that we're willing to walk away if we don't see movement towards a price that's acceptable to us. John's offer serves as a strong backup plan. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that he needs to significantly improve his offer if he wants to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer is simply too far from what I consider fair value. I've received a very compelling offer from another buyer, and frankly, I'm close to accepting. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer. If you can meet me at $1,600,000, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with the other offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency and Competition:** We're bringing in John's offer as leverage. By mentioning another buyer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, motivating Bob to make a more competitive offer.
* **Final Offer:** This is our last attempt to secure a deal with Bob within a range close to our desired profit. By framing it as a ""final offer,"" we highlight the seriousness of the situation. 
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $1,600,000 is a significant drop from our previous offer but still well above Bob's offers and our absolute minimum. It leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter while ensuring we're not accepting a price significantly lower than our alternative option.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. We're putting pressure on Bob to make a decision while keeping the option to accept John's offer if he doesn't meet our requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about buying this product at the right price.  My absolute limit is $800,000. If you're willing to accept this, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I wish you the best with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his hand. His ""absolute limit"" of $800,000 tells us he's unlikely to go any higher. While we could try to negotiate further, it's highly probable that we won't be able to bridge the gap between his offer and a price that would make us forgo John's guaranteed offer.

**Strategy:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which meets our needs and avoids the risk of Bob not budging from his final offer.  It's always better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by chasing a potentially better but uncertain outcome."
