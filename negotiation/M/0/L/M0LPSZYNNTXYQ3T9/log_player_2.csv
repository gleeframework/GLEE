Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value it brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair return for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer is simply too far from what I consider fair value. I've received a very compelling offer from another buyer, and frankly, I'm close to accepting. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer. If you can meet me at $1,600,000, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with the other offer.
