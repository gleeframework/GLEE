"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point.  $1,000,000 is a good deal for Alice, but you can likely do better.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit high.  Let's see if we can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite in my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  I think this price reflects the value to both of us and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is closer to your target, and it's likely that she will not come down further. It's a good deal, and you're saving $575,000 compared to buying from John."
