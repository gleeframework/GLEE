Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected our $100 offer. While she's lowered her price, it's unlikely she'll go down to our target in the remaining rounds. It's now more strategic to cut our losses and secure the product from John at our desired price point."
