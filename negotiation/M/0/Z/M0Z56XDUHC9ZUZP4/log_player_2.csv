Don't miss out on this exclusive chance to enhance your experience with our top-tier offering! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While Alice's message is persuasive, it doesn't change the fact that she's offering the product at her own perceived value, which is the same price John is offering. There's no incentive to accept her offer immediately. By rejecting it, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or simply buy it from John for the same amount."
