# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer will likely lead to Alice proposing a lower price, or you can always buy from John as a backup."
