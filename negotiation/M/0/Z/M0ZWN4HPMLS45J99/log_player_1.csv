"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fairer price for me."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. Let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, $132 is a good price and a decent compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by being too stubborn."
