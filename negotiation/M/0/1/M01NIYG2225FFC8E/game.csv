"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere for $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
