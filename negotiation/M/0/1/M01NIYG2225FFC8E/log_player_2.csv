"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere for $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget than John's offer of $1,200,000.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, accepting this offer saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a chance Alice could reject any counteroffer, leading to a higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
