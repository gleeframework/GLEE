Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go anywhere near $1500000. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, which is still a good price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still out of my range. I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe $850000 would be a fair price for both of us. It's a significant amount of money, and I'm confident this deal would be beneficial for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1000000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a significant amount of money for me, and I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
