Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000, which is a bit higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message concise and friendly, highlighting the value of the product to Bob while leaving room for discussion. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer is intended to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for further negotiation. I'm leaving room to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe there's still room to improve the price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum and closer to my desired price of $1,150,000. This shows flexibility but maintains a strong position.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while expressing that it's too low.  I frame my counteroffer as a win-win situation, appealing to his sense of fairness. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my preferred price. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully. If he accepts, I've secured a decent price."
