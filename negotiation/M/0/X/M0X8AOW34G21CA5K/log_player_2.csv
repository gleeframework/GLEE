Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, Bob! I can see you're willing to make some concessions, but I still need to make a bit more. How about we meet at $140, and we can call it a deal?

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $140.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $150, it makes more sense to cut your losses and take that deal rather than risk Alice increasing her price or the negotiations dragging on."
