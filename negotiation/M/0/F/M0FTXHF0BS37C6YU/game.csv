"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $150 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $162.50. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but based on my assessment, I believe $125 was a fair starting point. Considering the value to me, I am comfortable sticking to this price. However, if you could meet me halfway, perhaps at $140, I would consider it.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $140 is closer, but I still need to get at least $150 for the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a great deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am still not able to go above $140 for the product. I believe $140 is a fair price considering its value to me. If you could meet me at this price, I would be happy to proceed with the purchase.",140.0,Bob,6,
