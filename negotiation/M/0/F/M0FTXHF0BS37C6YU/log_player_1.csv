"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

While $125 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have the potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $150 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $162.50. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my assessment, I believe $125 was a fair starting point. Considering the value to me, I am comfortable sticking to this price. However, if you could meet me halfway, perhaps at $140, I would consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

$140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, even though John is a guaranteed sale. I want to try and see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, as he's shown interest in the product and has already come up from his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $140 is closer, but I still need to get at least $150 for the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a great deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am still not able to go above $140 for the product. I believe $140 is a fair price considering its value to me. If you could meet me at this price, I would be happy to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are now at round 6, and Bob has been insistent on $140. While this is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that the negotiation is getting drawn out, and I don't want to risk losing any more time. It's better to be certain of $150 from John rather than potentially getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
