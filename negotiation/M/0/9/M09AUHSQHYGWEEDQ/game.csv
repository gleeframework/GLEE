"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of that, I am proposing a revised price of $1,150,000 for the product. This allows us to find a balance between the value you see in the product and my asking price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations. I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
