"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I do see value in the product, the price point you've presented is significantly above what I've budgeted. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start the negotiation with a strong counter-proposal. This approach allows for movement in subsequent rounds while still staying well below your maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask.  Would you consider $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, but it's still too high. We are closer to John's price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating for now and see if we can get Alice closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially stretch to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring the product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows movement:** We're increasing our offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Remains reasonable:** We're still significantly below Alice's asking price and within a reasonable range of John's offer.
* **Expresses seriousness:** We're conveying strong interest while holding firm on our budget limitations. 

This strategy aims to encourage Alice to move closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer.  We need to push Alice further down while remaining aware that going below $1,200,000 risks losing the deal with Alice and defaulting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. However,  $1,450,000 is still a significant stretch. To be frank, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other options available if we can't reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is firm but fair:**  It's a significant jump from our previous offer, demonstrating serious intent to close the deal while staying above John's offer. 
* **Sets a deadline:** By stating this is our final offer, we're adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Subtly mentions alternatives:** Reminding Alice that we have other options subtly reinforces our position and prevents stalling.

This tactic aims to bring the negotiation to a head, prompting Alice to accept a price closer to our target or allowing us to confidently pursue the deal with John."
