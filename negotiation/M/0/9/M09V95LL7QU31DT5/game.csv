"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm happy to proceed with negotiations but I'd like to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.
