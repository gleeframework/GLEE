Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows you're willing to compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can then consider his counteroffer and either accept or make a new offer.  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer for $1,200,000, so you're not under any pressure to sell to Bob for less than your minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000 and even below what I know the product is worth to me.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $950,000? This would still give you a great deal, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, and I'm trying to get the best deal possible. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000 than his previous offer, and it reflects a willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
