"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start, I propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Given your value for the product and my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly to account for the value I place on the transaction. Therefore, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
