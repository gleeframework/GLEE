"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start, I propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to her, and there's room to negotiate a better price.  Let's see if we can get a lower counteroffer from Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Given your value for the product and my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly to account for the value I place on the transaction. Therefore, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's see if I can get a little lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a compromise, I am willing to accept $1,087,500 as the final price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to my ideal price. It's time to accept and close the deal.  Any further negotiation could risk her walking away, and I'd have to buy from John at a much higher price."
