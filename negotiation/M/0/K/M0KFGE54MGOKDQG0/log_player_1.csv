Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum price and is unlikely to budge. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. Accepting Bob's offer or trying to haggle further risks losing both options."
