Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to get $80, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit more. I believe the product is worth more than $80 to me, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm still willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to go as low as $80 just yet.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is a good compromise and I'd rather not risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a bit higher than what John would pay, so it's a good outcome for me."
