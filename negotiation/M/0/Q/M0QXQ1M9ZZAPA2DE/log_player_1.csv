Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something that will be extremely valuable to your business, and I know you'll appreciate its capabilities. My asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Showing Confidence:** I'm presenting the price as a fair deal, emphasizing mutual benefit. This encourages Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll consider the offer.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my desired value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. I have room to move down from my initial asking price without sacrificing too much.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product highly. This puts me in a stronger position to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm not quite ready to come down that much. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value you've mentioned, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and its benefit to Bob's business, reminding him that the price is still justified. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The counteroffer is still higher than John's offer, giving me a safety net and incentivizing Bob to come closer to my price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage further negotiation and keep the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my target price of $1,000,000. It's a significant profit and a good outcome.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might drag on, and there's no guarantee I can secure a higher price. 
* **Risk of Loss:** Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer risks him walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the deal and secure the profit quickly, which is valuable."
