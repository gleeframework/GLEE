Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $700,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, reflecting the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be close to your asking price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
