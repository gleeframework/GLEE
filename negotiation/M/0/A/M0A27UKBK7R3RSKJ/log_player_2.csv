"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a fantastic deal. It's well below your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer maximizes your savings."
