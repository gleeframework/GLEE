"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to me, so I should try to get a better price than $140. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
