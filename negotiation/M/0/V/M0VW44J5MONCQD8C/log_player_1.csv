Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe the product will be worth more than this to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is above my minimum value and it's a fair price considering Bob's budget. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation."
