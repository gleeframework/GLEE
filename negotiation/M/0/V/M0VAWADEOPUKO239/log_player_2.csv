Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my best offer and reflects the real worth of this product.
