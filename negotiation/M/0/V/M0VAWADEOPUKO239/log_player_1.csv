This is a tricky one, but here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best move now:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While we have a guaranteed offer from John, dragging it out risks Bob walking away.
* **Significant Movement:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest. Meeting him halfway shows flexibility and builds goodwill.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While $1,425,000 isn't our ideal price, it's a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and well above his perceived value. 

Waiting for a better offer from Bob might not be worth the risk of him reducing his offer or ending the negotiation."
