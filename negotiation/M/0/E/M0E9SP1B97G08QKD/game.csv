"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're a serious buyer.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay?  Let me know if you're open to that.",800000.0,Bob,4,,
