Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get as much as possible.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  By stating ""Let me know what you think!"" I am explicitly open to counteroffers, making the negotiation feel more collaborative. 
* **Plan B:** I have a fallback option with John, which gives me the power to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can potentially get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the gap a bit.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $8,000 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  I'm not dropping my price too much, but showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate that the product is valuable and that this is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Focus on compromise:**  I propose meeting halfway to show a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Open ended question:**  I end with an open ended question to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8500.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my target price of $9,000.
* **Value of deal:**  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant profit and worth the sale.
* **Time and risk:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I get a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
