"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $8000 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $9,000 is a better price than $12,000, he can likely still get a better deal. He has the leverage of being able to buy from John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate further."
