"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. My initial offer price is $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value, we set a high anchor point for the negotiation. This leaves room for potential concessions while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Show Confidence:**  The language used conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing the high price. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  The offer leaves a gap for negotiation but is still significantly above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. While we could accept and secure the sale, it leaves no room for negotiation and potentially undervalues the product's worth to him. We know he's willing to pay more, so we'll push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, but with Justification:** We've made a substantial concession from our initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, we're justifying the price by re-emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:** The $900,000 price point offers a significant profit margin for us while still saving Bob $100,000 from his perceived value. This encourages him to engage further. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While we've moved closer to his offer, we're still holding firm above our minimum to maximize potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still believe $900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $850,000 represents a $50,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price and is a significant gain. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has moved closer to our price range, indicating a willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer shows we're also flexible and value closing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's offer later. Accepting now secures a good deal without unnecessary delay."
