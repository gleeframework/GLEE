Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth considering. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the item, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $80 to me. Accepting his offer would mean I make no profit. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $80, it makes the most sense to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation."
