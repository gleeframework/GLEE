"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $975,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope this is more in line with what you're looking for.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good price for the product. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope this is more acceptable to you.",980000.0,Alice,7,
