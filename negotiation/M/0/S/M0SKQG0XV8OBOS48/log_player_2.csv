"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  It makes sense for Bob to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still slightly above Bob's budget.  At this point, Bob has two options: 

1. **Continue negotiating:** There's a chance Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, but there's also a risk that the negotiations could drag on or fail, forcing Bob to accept a price he's not comfortable with.

2. **Buy from John:** This is the safer option. John's price of $10,000 is within Bob's budget, guaranteeing a purchase without further negotiation.

Since Bob's priority is saving money, the certainty of buying from John at $10,000 is the most sensible choice."
