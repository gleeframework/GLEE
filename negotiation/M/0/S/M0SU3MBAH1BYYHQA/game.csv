"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  I can come down to $98.  That's only a small difference from your last offer, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's make this deal!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $98 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  That seems like a fair compromise.",96.0,Bob,6,
