"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer that is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to see if I can build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm confident you'll still get great value out of this product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $150.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but I can't go any lower than $110. This is a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm confident Bob won't go much higher, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'm going to take that offer."
