"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value, and I believe it's a fair price for such a valuable product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. Let's try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,850. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our shared desire to close this deal. What do you think?",8850.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,825? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8825.0,Bob,8,
