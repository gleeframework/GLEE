"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really looking for a good deal, and I'm confident I can get it for $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we discuss a price of $152?",152.0,Alice,5,
