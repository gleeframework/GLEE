Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $15,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
