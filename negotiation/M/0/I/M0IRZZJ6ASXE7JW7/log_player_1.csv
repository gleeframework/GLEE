Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a higher price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time I'll accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and while I'd ideally like more, $12,800 is a good price. It's significantly above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
