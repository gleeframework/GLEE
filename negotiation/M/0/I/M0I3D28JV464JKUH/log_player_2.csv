"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and see if we can negotiate a more favorable price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $10,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice is willing to meet me halfway. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows you to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still within my negotiation rounds and I can potentially get a lower price.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget and we've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000.  While I would have preferred to save even more,  it's important to be practical and avoid getting stuck in a long and potentially fruitless negotiation."
