Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's in excellent condition and will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately triggering a rejection.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Plan B:** Keeping John's offer in mind, I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for anything lower than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room to get a higher price from Bob, as his initial offer suggests he values the product at $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter and potentially nudge him closer to my target. 
* **Plan B:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $12,000? This still gives you a great deal and leaves some room for me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the Difference:** This strategy is often seen as fair and can lead to a faster agreement.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the potential value to Bob, reminding him of the good deal he's getting.
* **Staying Firm:** The offer still stays above my minimum price, while showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum of $10,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 

* **Close to Minimum:**  While I'd prefer more, this offer is still a significant profit compared to selling to John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  If I reject and counter, there's a chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds."
