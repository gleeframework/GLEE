"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm initially offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be frank, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $900,000. If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear that your budget has constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute limit. This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both sides.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, and I'm hoping you can see the value in closing this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
