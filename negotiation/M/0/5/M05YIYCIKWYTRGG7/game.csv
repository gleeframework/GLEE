"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet at $11,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.  ",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10,750. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. But if not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Bob,8,
