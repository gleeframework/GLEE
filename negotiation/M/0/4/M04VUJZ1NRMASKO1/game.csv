"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,600,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,350,000? This is the best I can do, but I'm willing to compromise to get this product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work.  Let's go with $1,425,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $1,425,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay below $1,400,000. How about $1,375,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to compromise to get this product.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
