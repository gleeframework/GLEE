"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is a competitive price that still allows you to make a profit while also being fair to me. What are your thoughts?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  He has already rejected Alice's offer of $1,300,000 which is still above his budget. He has been negotiating with Alice but it seems that she isn't willing to come down to his price range.  By purchasing from John, Bob can secure the product at his desired price point, saving him $100,000 compared to Alice's offer."
