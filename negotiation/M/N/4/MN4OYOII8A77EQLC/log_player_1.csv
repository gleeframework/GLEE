Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above your minimum price of $80.
* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond.

This strategy balances the need to maximize your profit with the risk of losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is your minimum, Bob's offer is too low considering:

* **His value:** The product is worth $120 to him, so he can afford to pay more. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  We can likely negotiate a price closer to $100, which would be more beneficial for you.

**Next steps:**  We will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than our initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $90. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit higher than your minimum.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** By reminding him that it's a ""benefit for both of us,"" we subtly emphasize that he's getting a good deal.
* **Open door for further negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to continue the discussion, keeping the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our minimum:** $85 is very close to our minimum price of $80, and we are unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.
* **Potential for higher offers:** We can always try to get a better price from a different buyer in the future.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy, which could be better spent on other opportunities. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $85 is the most sensible decision at this point.  We can secure a good price while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
