"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
