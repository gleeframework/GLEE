"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
