"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a great product, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested and would be happy to buy it if we could agree on a price closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8500.  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement, as this is a fantastic product.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $8800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
