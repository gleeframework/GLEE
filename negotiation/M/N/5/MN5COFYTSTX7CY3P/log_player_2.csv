"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my target price of $12,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a great product, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested and would be happy to buy it if we could agree on a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target of $12,000. I want to see if I can get her closer to my price before I consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8500.  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement, as this is a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $8800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $8,800 is now within my budget. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal.  While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great."
