"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how far apart our valuations are.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, but I know he values the product at $800,000. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value to you is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I propose $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm strategically moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant margin above his valuation.  This shows flexibility while reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to nudge him towards accepting a price closer to my target. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have rounds remaining, securing a deal sooner is generally advantageous. This offer attempts to find an agreeable point relatively quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I will consider it, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value of the product and a substantial profit for me. It's also more than John's standing offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, securing the deal now provides immediate returns and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation.
* **Negotiation Success:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my asking price, indicating his genuine interest and validating my negotiation strategy. Accepting this offer represents a successful outcome."
