"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant return on investment. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've already factored in considerable potential for your success.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,950,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,950,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to consider $1,700,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $1,825,000? This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business while recognizing your investment.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,825,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,675,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's settle this now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can offer while still honoring the value of this product.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
