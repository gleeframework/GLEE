{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference at $122.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 122.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $122.50. I'm willing to pay $120, which is my maximum.  Let me know if that works for you.
