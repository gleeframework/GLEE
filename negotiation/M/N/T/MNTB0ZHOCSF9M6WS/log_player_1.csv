Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. It's worth the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below the value of what this product provides. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $17,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob is clearly stuck on a price point significantly lower than my minimum. While he might be willing to go a bit higher, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
