Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me leverage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit slightly.

By starting high, I increase the chances of getting closer to my desired profit margin."
