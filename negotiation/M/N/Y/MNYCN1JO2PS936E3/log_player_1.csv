"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

This is a strategic starting point, leaving room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. However, if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably or if I feel like the time is running out, I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally want to sell for more, accepting his offer right now would mean losing a significant amount of money. 

I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm also keeping the option to sell to John in mind, as that's a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise, making it seem like a fair solution for both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation going.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. However, I'm still keeping the option to sell to John in mind, as I don't want to give away the product too cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go above $11,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to accept it yet.

I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get him to go higher. However, I'm closely monitoring the number of rounds left. If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to meet you halfway and offer $12,500 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal and move on!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's latest offer ($11,000). This shows a strong commitment to reaching a compromise.
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to ""close this deal"" and ""move on,"" creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm saying this is the ""best I can do,"" suggesting that there's no room for further negotiation.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. We're down to only five rounds left, and I'm getting closer to the point where I might need to sell to John to ensure a decent profit."
