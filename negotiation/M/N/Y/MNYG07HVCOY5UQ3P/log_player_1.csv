Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This gives us room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and hopefully reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value Bob places on the product while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can sell to John for a much higher price, so I'm going to take that option."
