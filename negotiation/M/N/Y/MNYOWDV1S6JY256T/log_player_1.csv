Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing an initial price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for discussion."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget, I'd be happy to purchase the product for $12,000. This seems fair considering the value I place on the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To make this work for me, I could come down to $18,000.  This price reflects the true worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  It's the most I can afford, and it's a fair price considering what I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firmly anchored at $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer means losing out on $3,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
