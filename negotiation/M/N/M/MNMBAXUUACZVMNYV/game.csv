"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price that I think is a fair reflection of its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the range of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,050,000, which is $987,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",987500.0,Alice,5,
