Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $70 is below my minimum, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we try $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit more.  I still have rounds left, and I think I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $78 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise again - how about $82? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it worth it."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $82. Can we try $79? I'm willing to make one more compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting a bit risky to keep negotiating. I'm only 1 round away from my minimum, but Bob is stubborn, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price. Selling to John for $80 is the safest option, ensuring I don't lose money."
