Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your safety net with John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (This is the space where you can negotiate)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  There's no emotional need to be ""nice"" since you have a guaranteed buyer.  This allows for a strong opening offer.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will provide a significant return on your investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** This price captures a significant portion of the potential profit margin ($350,000 for you, $150,000 benefit for Bob compared to his perceived value).
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions you as doing Bob a favor by granting him this opportunity.
* **No Justification:**  You don't need to explain your pricing. Let Bob counter if he wants to negotiate. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer.  Have a lower limit in mind (maybe $1,200,000) that you're willing to accept.
* **Don't Reveal John:** Never let Bob know you have another buyer. This weakens your position."
