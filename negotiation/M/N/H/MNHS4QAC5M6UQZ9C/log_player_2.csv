I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000, which reflects its true worth. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's in your best interest to seize it.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer who is ready to purchase at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
