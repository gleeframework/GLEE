"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
