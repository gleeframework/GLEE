{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate and potentially make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps to avoid confusion and keep the negotiation moving forward.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then evaluate his counteroffer and consider whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:**  John is willing to pay your minimum price, so selling to him guarantees you a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation space:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your position and continue the negotiation. You can now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but still maintains your position.
* **Counteroffer is below your minimum:** You're willing to compromise slightly but still aim for a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and specific, encouraging further discussion. 

This counteroffer allows you to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway. If he rejects again, you can either make another counteroffer, or ultimately choose to sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $7,000 might be a big drop. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $7,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below what you're aiming for.
* **John's offer guarantees your minimum:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum of $12,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lower price, while selling to John guarantees a higher profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you choose to pursue the more secure option of selling to John. You've already made several concessions, and the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of ending up with a price far below your desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise but still maintains your position.
* **Counteroffer is closer to your minimum:** You're willing to come down a bit more, but still aiming for a price that's closer to your desired range. 
* **Clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and specific, encouraging further discussion.

This counteroffer gives Bob another opportunity to agree on a price that is acceptable for both of you.  However, you are still aware that you can sell the product to John for $12,000 if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet your expectations."
