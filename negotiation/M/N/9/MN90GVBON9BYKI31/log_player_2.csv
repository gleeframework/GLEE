Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above our budget. It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make further negotiation worthwhile.  We should take John's offer."
