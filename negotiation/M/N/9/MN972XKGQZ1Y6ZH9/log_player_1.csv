Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a profit, and this price leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also shows you are serious about selling. 

By starting with a strong offer, you set a high bar for the negotiation and leave yourself room to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, but I can likely do better. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. My counteroffer will be closer to my initial offer, but still leave some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still keeping the price above my minimum.  I believe this demonstrates flexibility while showing I'm still aiming for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. If Bob refuses to budge further, I'll be ready to accept his offer or move on to John.  However, I'm hoping a final counteroffer will convince him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1390000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also showing that I'm not willing to go any lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident that he will go any higher.  I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and potentially lose a good deal with John.  Selling to John ensures I receive a decent price for the product without further risk."
