"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value this product will bring to your business. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
