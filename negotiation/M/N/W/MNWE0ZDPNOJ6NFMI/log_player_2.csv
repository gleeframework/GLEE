"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is within your budget, it's still too high. You want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the product's benefits.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's still above Alice's minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. This aggressive counteroffer might encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both find a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise but are still pushing for a lower price. The $8,750 offer is closer to Alice's ideal price while remaining within your budget. It creates a space for Alice to potentially accept or make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
