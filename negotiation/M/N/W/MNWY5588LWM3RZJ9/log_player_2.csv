{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Based on our discussion, I would like to offer the product to you for $9,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  He's only 500 dollars away from his target price with John, so he should see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $8,750 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am proposing a price of $8,900 for the product. This reflects a compromise that maintains the value of the product while being more accessible to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but she's still $100 above what John is offering.  It's not clear if Alice will come down any further, and there is a risk that if Bob keeps rejecting her offers, she might walk away from the deal completely."
