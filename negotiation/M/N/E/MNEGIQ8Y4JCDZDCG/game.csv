"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Let's see if we can make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
