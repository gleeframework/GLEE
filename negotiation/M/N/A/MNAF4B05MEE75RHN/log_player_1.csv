"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $105. That's the most I can stretch to at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, but if he keeps refusing, I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This is my final offer, and I really want to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to propose $105.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to feel like Bob is just playing games.  I've already gone down significantly from my initial asking price, and I'm not sure if he'll ever meet me in the middle.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a never-ending negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not risking further haggling that might lead to a worse outcome."
