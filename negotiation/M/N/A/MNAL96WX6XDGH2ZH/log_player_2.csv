"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value of your business operations. Given its high worth to you at $15,000, I propose to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to the market value and is an opportunity not to be missed. I trust this proposal aligns well with your financial planning and strategic goals. Let's discuss how we can make this transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Rejecting Alice's offer leaves the option to negotiate further with Alice or explore other sellers."
