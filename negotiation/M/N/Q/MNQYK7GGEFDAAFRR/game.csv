"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my valuation of the product, I am unable to agree to $1,000,000. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still not comfortable with $975,000. I would like to propose a price of $960,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
