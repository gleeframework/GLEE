"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $95. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
