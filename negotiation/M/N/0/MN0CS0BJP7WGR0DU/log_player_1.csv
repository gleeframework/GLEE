{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum price. It sets a starting point for negotiation. I'm leaving room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but I'm also giving myself the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $95. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too far below my minimum price of $120. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for a significant loss.  I'll sell to John for $120, which is a much more favorable outcome for me."
