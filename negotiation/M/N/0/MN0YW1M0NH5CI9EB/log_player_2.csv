Bob can do better than $12,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should accept this offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, he's already gotten the price down to a point that's within his budget, and Alice has indicated she's not willing to go any lower.  Trying to push further risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
