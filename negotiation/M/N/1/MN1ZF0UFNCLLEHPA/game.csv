"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your operations.  I'm confident this price is fair considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value. I'm happy to sell you the product for $950,000.  This price is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
