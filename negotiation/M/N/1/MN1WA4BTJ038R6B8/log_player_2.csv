"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's minimum value ($10,000).  This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $11000 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer of $11,500 to $11,000. This is a significant discount and gets Bob closer to his desired price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may reject and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice for Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
