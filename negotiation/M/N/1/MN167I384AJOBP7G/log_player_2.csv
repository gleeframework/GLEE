"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I value this product at $1,200,000, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's start there."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your valuation of the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is my best and final offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer in the next round. While John's offer is tempting, it's still worth seeing if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,520,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth rejecting and trying to get closer to my target price with another counteroffer.  John's offer is always a backup, but I'd rather see if I can secure a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,520,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and I've already offered my maximum. While I'd prefer to buy from Alice if the price was right, it's time to cut my losses and take John's offer. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm running out of time to negotiate with Alice."
