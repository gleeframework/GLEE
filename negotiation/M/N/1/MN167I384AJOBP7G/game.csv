,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I value this product at $1,200,000, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's start there.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your valuation of the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is my best and final offer for this round.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,520,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,520,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1520000.0,Alice,7,
