Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still offer an attractive price to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than $150. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** If you start too high (e.g., $150), Bob will likely reject the offer outright, and you'll have to sell it to John for your minimum price. 

This strategy balances getting the best price while still making the sale to Bob more likely."
