"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price, so I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
