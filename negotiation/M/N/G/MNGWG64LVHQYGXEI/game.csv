"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is far too low.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, and it's really the lowest I can go.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
