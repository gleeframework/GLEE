"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. While it's a good deal compared to the product's value to you, it's still not within your desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget. While it's a compromise, I'm still determined to get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $10,200. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is close to my budget, but I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal.  While negotiating further with Alice might lead to a lower price, it's not guaranteed and I'm not willing to risk spending more time.  It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid further negotiation."
