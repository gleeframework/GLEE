Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $11,500 is still a significant profit over John's offer of $10,000."
