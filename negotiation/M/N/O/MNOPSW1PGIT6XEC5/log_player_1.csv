Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strong Opening:** A starting price of $15,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I signal that I'm open to discussing the price further, making it more likely Bob will engage instead of outright rejecting the offer."
