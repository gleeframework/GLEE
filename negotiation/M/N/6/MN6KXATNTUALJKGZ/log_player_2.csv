"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if you can get her to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating, but still within a reasonable range. You're hoping this will get Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is a reasonable price considering your initial goal of saving as much money as possible.  While you could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or that you'll run out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out to John."
