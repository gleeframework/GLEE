"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a premium price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting out of the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get it for less. How about $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free warranty and some additional support services, and we meet at $13,000? It's the best I can do.",13000.0,Alice,5,
