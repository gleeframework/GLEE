"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you!  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $7,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still a good bit away from her value and there's no rush to settle. Let's counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a more favorable price."
