"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the opportunity to buy from John entirely."
