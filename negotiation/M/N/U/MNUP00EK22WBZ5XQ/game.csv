"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
