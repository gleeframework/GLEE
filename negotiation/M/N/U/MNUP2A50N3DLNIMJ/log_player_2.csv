"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to work with Alice, and Bob can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further.  Bob has 7 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price, and he can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's getting closer, it's better to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further. Bob has 5 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price, and he can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $12,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.  I'm eager to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. I'm getting close to my minimum, so I hope we can meet here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's getting closer, Bob is running out of time. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of Alice coming down to a price that Bob is comfortable with are slim.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees a successful purchase within Bob's budget."
