"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
