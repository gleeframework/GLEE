Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your floor price:**  You're not leaving money on the table, ensuring you get a good return.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has a $100,000 potential gain, making it likely he'll want to negotiate, giving you leverage.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Offering the full $1,500,000 might make Bob suspicious and potentially less likely to negotiate.
