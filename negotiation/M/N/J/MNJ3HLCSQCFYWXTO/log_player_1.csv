Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm happy to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to see if Bob is interested in the product at all.  

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept (if it's close to my desired price) or make a counteroffer of my own.  If negotiations stall, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  While I'm interested, $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** While Bob's initial offer is too low, his message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal.**  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering, potentially closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $115 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $125 is still a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts my offer, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If not, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay, but I'm close. How about $120?  This would be a good price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a quick sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiation.
* **Slight Loss but Acceptable:** While I would prefer a higher price, losing $30 is a small compromise for a guaranteed sale.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, finalize the sale, and move on to other opportunities."
