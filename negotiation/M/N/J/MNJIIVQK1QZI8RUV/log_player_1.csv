Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is above my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to the $150 value he places on the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120, and it's closer to my initial asking price than what John is offering.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
