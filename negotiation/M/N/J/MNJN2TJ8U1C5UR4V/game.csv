"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,600,000 is not even in the ballpark.  If you're serious about selling, I'd be willing to consider an offer around $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be completely transparent, I've found similar products in the range of $900,000. If you're able to meet that price point, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the research you've done. While I understand your position, the product I'm offering has unique features and advantages that justify a higher price point than the alternatives you've found. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,125,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
