Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above your minimum of $120 but leaves room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I think the product is worth. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm willing to move a little closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $132 is closer to my desired price and higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
