"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further. You can save potentially $100,000 by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

You're still $50,000 away from your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate down a little further before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,025,000? That seems like a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,030,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer.  You're only $30,000 away from your desired price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a good deal considering John is selling the product for $1,200,000."
