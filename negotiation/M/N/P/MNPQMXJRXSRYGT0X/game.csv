"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $18,000.  This reflects the value it would bring you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a substantial difference from what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we try $13,000?  That's me moving closer to your last offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
