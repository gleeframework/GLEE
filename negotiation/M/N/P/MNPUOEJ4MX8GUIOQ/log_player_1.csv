Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will pay $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better outcome. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  We need to propose a price significantly lower than John's offer while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle on a price higher than $1,500,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes limited information about Bob's financial capabilities and negotiation tactics.
* We're balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (leading us to accept John's lower offer) against the potential reward of a higher sale price."
