Round 7
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,525,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the best possible price."
