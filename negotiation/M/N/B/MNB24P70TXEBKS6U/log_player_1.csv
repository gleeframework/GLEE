Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message implies it's worth a significant amount by mentioning ""its value.""
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly reminding Bob that you have other options (""list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and competition.

This offer aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards, knowing John provides a guaranteed $12,000 backup."
