"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its unique potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a sound investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This offer is fair considering the value you've placed on it and aligns with my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your position, $1,100,000 undervalues the asset significantly. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This reflects a degree of flexibility on my part while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,450,000 remains beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise considering your valuation of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
