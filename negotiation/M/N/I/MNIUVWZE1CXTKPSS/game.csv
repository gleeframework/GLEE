"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept to get this off my hands quickly. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. That's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
