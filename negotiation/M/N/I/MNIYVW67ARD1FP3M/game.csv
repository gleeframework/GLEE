,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $200 might seem steep, but the value of this product is definitely higher than $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $95? I feel that's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - $120, and it's yours.",120.0,Alice,5,
