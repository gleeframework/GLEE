"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for a deal around $90.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  $105 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  Let's try $95.  This feels like a fair deal for both of us. ",95.0,Bob,6,
