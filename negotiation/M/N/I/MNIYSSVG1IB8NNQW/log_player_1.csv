"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" for both of us, trying to build some goodwill. 
* **Open ended:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, encouraging him to respond.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer is designed to:

* Gauge Bob's interest. 
* Set a high starting point for negotiations.
* Leave room to lower the price if needed.
* See if Bob will counter-offer in Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $500,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum and even lower than his perceived value.  I need to reject this offer and try to get a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and counter:** It's better to reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. There are still more rounds to negotiate. 
* **Don't sell to John yet:**  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I might be able to get closer to that number with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer, but I'm also showing a willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair price"" for both of us, implying that it's a good deal for him considering the product's worth.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language (""make this happen"") to maintain a friendly and constructive negotiation atmosphere. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy here is to:

* Show that I'm serious about negotiating, but not desperate. 
*  Maintain a price point above my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* See if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I need to keep pushing for a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Hold firm:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, so I need to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price.
* **Don't give in to pressure:** Bob's ""fair compromise"" is not a fair compromise for me. I need to hold firm and let him know that I'm not willing to settle for that.
* **Keep negotiating:** With five rounds left, there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $700,000 is still too far off.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this."" , ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but stand firm:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from $900,000 to $850,000, but I'm still maintaining a price point above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value and the fairness of my offer.
* **Collaborative approach:** I'm using language like ""work together"" to emphasize that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to:

*  Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
*  Stay above my minimum while giving Bob a sense of progress.
*  Encourage a more serious counter-offer from Bob in the next round."
