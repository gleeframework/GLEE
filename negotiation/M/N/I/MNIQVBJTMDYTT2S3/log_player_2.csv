"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You can always fall back to John if the negotiation fails."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price and a reasonable compromise.  It's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice without risking the deal falling through."
