"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. 
* There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible, so you are offering a price closer to Alice's value of $100. 
* Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It leaves some room for Alice to counter, but it's still a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your desired price point.
* You have limited rounds, and rejecting the offer could lead to further counteroffers that may not be favorable. 
* Accepting the offer allows you to acquire the product for a price that is within your budget and leaves some room for a potential profit if you choose to resell the product."
