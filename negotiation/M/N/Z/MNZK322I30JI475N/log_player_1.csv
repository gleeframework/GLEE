{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $8000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go that low.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose $8500 as a compromise. This still keeps me within my financial limits while allowing you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than my previous counteroffer. While I'd prefer $9,000, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead me to selling to John for $10,000."
