Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable going back up to $950,000, I'd like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. This allows me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair return for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.

While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than selling to John and only $75,000 away from my initial offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
