"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would allow me to make a good profit, while still giving you a significant value for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable going back up to $950,000, I'd like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. This allows me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair return for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
