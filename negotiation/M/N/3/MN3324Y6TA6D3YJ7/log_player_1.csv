Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than the $80 Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will tell you how motivated he is to buy.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have room to bargain.
* **Maintain your leverage:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a bit closer to my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I still have the option of selling to John for $120, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
