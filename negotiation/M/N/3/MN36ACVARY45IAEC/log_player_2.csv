"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $11,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes more sense to counter-offer Alice and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. John offers the product at Bob's desired price, making it the best option at this point."
