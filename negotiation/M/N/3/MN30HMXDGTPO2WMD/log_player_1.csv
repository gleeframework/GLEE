Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to start too low.  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our minimum acceptable amount ($1,500,000).
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though we haven't revealed the other offer from John.
* **Urgency:** Requesting a quick decision from Bob adds a subtle pressure to act before someone else (John, in this case) takes the deal.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to find a balance: 
*  **Maximize profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob.
*  **Secure the sale:**  We don't want to price Bob out completely, as we have a guaranteed sale with John. 

By starting high, we give ourselves the best chance to negotiate a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation while still remaining attractive compared to losing the opportunity."
