Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $9,500 is more than your $8,000 floor, so you're already making a profit.
* **Below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially raise the price if Bob is eager to buy, or you can go lower if he's hesitant. 

By starting with a strong offer, you give yourself a good chance of securing a great deal with Bob while also being prepared to accept a lower price or switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $9000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer of $9,500. You want to maximize your profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Counter with a higher price:** You can try to get closer to your target of $9,500, or even higher. 
* **See how determined Bob is:** If he's willing to counteroffer again, it shows he's truly interested in the product and might be willing to go higher.
* **Maintain leverage:** You're not in a rush to sell, and you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $8,000.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, you should make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer, but still within a range that is acceptable to you. Keep in mind that you want to find the sweet spot where you get the best price possible while also keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little closer to my initial price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to drop too far below your initial offer.
* **Still attractive to Bob:**  $9,250 is still well below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him a good deal.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You're open to dropping the price slightly if Bob is adamant about $9,000.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, keeping Bob interested in the deal while giving you a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9100. This is the highest amount I can afford for your product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. You've already rejected his previous offer, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher price. 

Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Profit:** You'll secure a profit of $1,100, which is better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate might take longer and there's no certainty of a better outcome. 
* **Risk:** If you reject and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with the less desirable option of selling to John.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good profit and avoid unnecessary risk."
