Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still ensuring we get more than our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we know John will buy it for $150, ensuring we don't lose out. 

By starting high but not unreasonable, we maximize our chances of a profitable sale to Bob while having a safety net in John."
