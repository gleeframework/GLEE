"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable offer:** $12,500 is still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000, making it a reasonable offer for her to consider. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation while expressing Bob's interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has come down in price,  Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  
* **Close to John's offer:**  $13,500 is getting closer to John's price of $15,000, so Bob needs to be careful not to get too close to that point.
* **Strategic counter-offer:**  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer, trying to find that sweet spot where he gets a good price while ensuring Alice doesn't walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing negotiation:**  Bob is showing continued interest and willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** $13,000 is exactly halfway between Alice's offer of $13,500 and Bob's previous offer of $12,500, making it a logical compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  Bob stresses the fairness of the proposed price, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
