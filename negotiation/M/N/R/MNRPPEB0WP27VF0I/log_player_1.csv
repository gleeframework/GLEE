"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to allow room for negotiation, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a quick agreement, but I'm prepared to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
