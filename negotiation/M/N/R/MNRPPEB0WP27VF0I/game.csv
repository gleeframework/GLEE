"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
