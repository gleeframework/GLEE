Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 
We are in a negotiation, and coming down from the initial high price shows a willingness to deal, but not too much. Bob's offer was significantly below my minimum, so this keeps the ball in his court while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is now above my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting into the later rounds. It's better to take a good profit now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
