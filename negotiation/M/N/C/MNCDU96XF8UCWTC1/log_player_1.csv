Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $15,000 gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's beneficial for both of us.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum, but not outrageously high, so it leaves space for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and open tone in my message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to settle immediately. There's a chance I can get more.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Exploring potential:**  Even if Bob won't go higher, the negotiation process might give me valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,500?  I think this is a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my initial price:**  $13,500 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.
* **Reasoning and justification:** Providing a justification for the price helps build a stronger case and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12800? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm looking for in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,800 is only slightly above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher offer, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Negotiating fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and I'm likely to get closer to my minimum price than to my ideal price."
