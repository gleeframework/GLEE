"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. Buying from John immediately is also an option, but there's a chance you could get a better deal by negotiating with Alice first."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer you $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $8,000. While she has lowered the price, it's still not a deal I'm ready to accept.  I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, perhaps closer to my counteroffer of $8,500. Buying from John immediately would mean I get the product, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a significant step towards your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'll counteroffer $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price will not drop significantly lower.  To ensure I get the product and avoid further negotiation, I'll buy it from John for $8,000. This guarantees a purchase within my budget, even if it means losing out on the potential for a slightly better deal with Alice."
