"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
