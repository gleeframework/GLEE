"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $9,000 is the right price for me. How about $8,250? That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,750, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not sure if $8,750 is the right price for me. How about $8,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm hoping we can get closer to the price I'm looking for.",8500.0,Bob,6,
