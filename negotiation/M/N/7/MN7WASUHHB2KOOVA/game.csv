"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $2,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
