"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13750? This gives you a great price and ensures I get a fair value for my product. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but I need to stay closer to my original offer of $14000. How about we compromise at $13625? This gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I receive a fair price. Let me know if that works for you.",13625.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $13375? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13375.0,Bob,6,
