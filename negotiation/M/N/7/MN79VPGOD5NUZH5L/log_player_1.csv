{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to make sure the deal goes through.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation. 
* **Iterative approach:** I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer.  I'll adjust my offers based on his counteroffers, but I'll never go below my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product for me.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to consider:

* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  He's shown he's willing to pay more than his initial estimate, so there's room for compromise.
* **My minimum acceptable price:** I won't go below $15,000, even if it means losing the deal with Bob. 
* **John's offer:** I have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000, which gives me leverage."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,750? This gives you a great price and ensures I get a fair value for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,750, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and acknowledging Bob's perspective. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the ""great deal"" he'll get at this price.
* **Strategy:** By offering a middle ground, I'm hoping to get Bob closer to my desired price without risking losing him completely. I'm also demonstrating flexibility, which can be beneficial in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider another counteroffer, perhaps adjusting the price slightly or changing my approach. It's important to remember that John's offer of $15,000 is always an option if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me, even if it means losing the deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us, but I won't budge on my minimum price. I'll also keep John's offer in mind, as it provides a safety net if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but I need to stay closer to my original offer of $14,000. How about we compromise at $13,625? This gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I receive a fair price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13625}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,625, which is closer to my previous offer of $14,000 but still acknowledges Bob's need for a lower price.
* **Message:** I'm being firm about my minimum price while still showing willingness to compromise. I'm also reiterating the benefits of the deal for Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept.
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to find a sweet spot where I get as close to my desired price as possible without pushing Bob away.  I'm also using the word ""compromise"" to make the offer feel like a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I might consider lowering my counteroffer slightly, but I'll be cautious not to go below $13,500. If necessary, I'll rely on John's offer of $15,000 as my backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $13375? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,375

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,375 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've made multiple counteroffers and have reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. I don't want to risk losing the deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. 

**It's time to move on to a sure deal with John.**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal of $15,000, securing the deal with John is the most sensible choice at this point."
