Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer without me feeling like I've given away too much. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's value and potential benefit to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer (if any) and use this information to adjust my strategy. I'm also mindful of the $150 offer from John, which provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150), it's still below my desired profit margin.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Exploring Counteroffer Potential:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially find a price point that works for both of us. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I have a backup plan with John's offer, so I can afford to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind the balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $105? This gives you a good deal, and it lets me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (But Not Really):** I'm using Bob's ""meet me halfway"" language, but I'm suggesting a price closer to my ideal than his. This is a tactic to make my counteroffer appear more reasonable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price still gives Bob a good deal, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positioning for a Deal:** $105 is a fair middle ground, and I'm confident that it's a price Bob might be willing to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer and be prepared to negotiate further or accept his offer if it seems like a good deal.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's just slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This is close enough to my minimum to consider accepting.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal.  It's possible Bob might not budge further, and I might end up selling to John for $150 anyway.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I'm not sure if John is still waiting, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity while waiting for a potential better offer.

**Next Steps:**

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll proceed with the sale. If I had rejected it, I would have considered a counteroffer at $102 or $103, but would still have been leaning towards accepting Bob's offer."
