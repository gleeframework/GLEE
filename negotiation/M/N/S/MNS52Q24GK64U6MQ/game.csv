"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about I offer $1,200,000 for the product? This still gives us room for profit while saving you some money.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's definitely closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $1,250,000? This would still give you a good margin, and I'm confident we can make this work for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
