You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and her valuation of $800,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at your maximum budget. 

**Strategy:**

There's a good chance Alice will make another offer closer to your budget since it's in her best interest to sell to you rather than lose the sale entirely."
