"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm making a compromise to make the deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to your desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
