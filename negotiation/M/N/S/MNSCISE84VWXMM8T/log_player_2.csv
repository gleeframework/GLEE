"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's not a reasonable starting point for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm making a compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get a price closer to his $8,000 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to your desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget of $8,000.  While it's closer than previous offers, it's unlikely that further negotiation will bring the price down enough to be acceptable to Bob.  It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $8,000."
