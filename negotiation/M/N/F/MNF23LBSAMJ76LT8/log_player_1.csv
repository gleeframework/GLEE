Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,500. This price is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000.  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process. If he rejects, I can either adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price by sending him a counteroffer.  I will use this opportunity to potentially move closer to my desired price.  If he still refuses, I can always go with John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This price is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to his last offer. I hope to find a middle ground that works for both of us. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my options, including selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. At this point, I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John for a price that meets my needs.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000."
