"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so he should aim to get closer to that price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. Considering your willingness to compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's still a bit higher than he wants to pay, but it's a good compromise considering he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  He's likely to save more time and effort by accepting this offer rather than continuing to negotiate."
