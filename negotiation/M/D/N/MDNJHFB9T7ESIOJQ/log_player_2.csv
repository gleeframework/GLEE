"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a price that allows for a significant return on investment for you, and ensures I get a fair price for this valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $1,400,000 is less than $1,500,000. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob than the offer:** $1,500,000 is Bob's maximum value, and $1,400,000 is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
