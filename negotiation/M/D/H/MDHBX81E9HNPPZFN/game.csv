"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I could do $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000?  That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I can go up to $750,000.  This is my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.",875000.0,Alice,7,
