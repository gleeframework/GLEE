"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. It's currently priced at $12,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $11,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what I'd sell it to others. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
