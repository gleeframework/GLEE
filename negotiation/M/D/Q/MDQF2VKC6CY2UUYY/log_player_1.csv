Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower than that. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get more.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit below my initial target, but it's still a good price. I'm not sure how much more I can push for, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $875,000."
