"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price being below market value, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still above her desired price of $1,200,000 but within my budget of $1,500,000.  I can save $150,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she could reject my counteroffer and I might end up with a worse outcome. Accepting her offer at this point is the most sensible choice."
