"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price being below market value, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
