"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price being below market value, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
