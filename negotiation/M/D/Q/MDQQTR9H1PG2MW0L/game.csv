"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1150000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I think this is a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1250000. I'm willing to go up to $1170000, but no more. I think this is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget.",1170000.0,Bob,6,
