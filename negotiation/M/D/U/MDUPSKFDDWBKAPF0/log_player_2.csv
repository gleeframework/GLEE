You can still try to negotiate a lower price.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, you're still paying more than your budget."

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a little higher than you want to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
