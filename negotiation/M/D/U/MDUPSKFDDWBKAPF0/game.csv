"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price given the product's value and the savings you'll get compared to selling it to John. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think selling to John might be a better option...",10750.0,Alice,5,
