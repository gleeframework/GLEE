"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,012,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
