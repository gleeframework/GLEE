"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the immense worth of what we're discussing. "",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique value"" and ""investment potential"" without being too specific.  This leaves room for Bob to justify a higher price to himself.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language (""initially proposing"") signals that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  People tend to fixate on the first number presented.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how aggressively he wants the product.
3. **Leave Room for Concessions:**  A lower starting point would limit my ability to negotiate effectively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. This suggests:

* **He's anchoring low:**  He's trying to shift the negotiation in his favor.
* **He's potentially undervaluing:** He might be willing to go higher.

Accepting $800,000 is a significant loss. While selling to John is always an option, I still have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the unique benefits this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show I'm open to negotiation, but I clearly state it's too low. 
* **Justification:**  I'm re-emphasizing the ""unique benefits,"" reminding Bob of the value proposition.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm dropping $400,000 from my initial offer, which is a significant move designed to encourage Bob to make a counter-concession. 
* **Above Minimum:** Importantly, I'm still aiming for a price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching his Value:** Bob is now offering his perceived value of the product. This is a positive sign, indicating he's serious about the purchase. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** However, I still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a price above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. However, I believe this is my absolute best offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a final significant concession ($200,000), signaling my willingness to close the deal but also setting a clear boundary.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the ""true value"" while acknowledging Bob's perspective to create a sense of fairness.
* **Above Minimum, Below Stated Value:** This offer positions the price above my minimum but below Bob's initial statement of the product's worth to him.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiations. Putting forth my ""best offer"" adds a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. It seems we are getting closer.  I could potentially go up to $1,100,000.  Do you think that might work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is now willing to exceed his initial perceived value, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Potential Upside:** While $1,100,000 is still below my target, Bob's language (""potentially go up"") suggests there might be room for further negotiation.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to leverage my position and the remaining rounds to see if I can secure a better deal, knowing I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on price.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,500,000. However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to finalize this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** I'm revealing John's offer to create a sense of urgency and demonstrate the product's strong market value. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the offer as a gesture of fairness to Bob while maintaining a strong position.
* **Final Compromise:**  The offer of $1,250,000 is a clear midpoint between his current offer and John's offer. This signals my willingness to compromise but sets a firm limit.
* **Limited Time:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm putting the decision in Bob's hands to encourage a quick response."
