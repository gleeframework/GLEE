Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on price.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,500,000. However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to finalize this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000. She's revealed she has another buyer at $1,500,000 and is using that as leverage. While she might come down slightly, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay."
