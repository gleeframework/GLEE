"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's the best I can do.,105.0,Bob,4,
