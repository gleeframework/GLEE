Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while leaving room for us both to make a fair deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This price recognizes the value you've described while being within my financial range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,850,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,850,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I am still making a substantial profit of $350,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. The difference between his offer and my desired price is now relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 

Accepting $1,850,000 represents a strong outcome in this negotiation."
