"Alice, your product seems interesting, but the initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, reflecting its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but  $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant step in your direction.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
