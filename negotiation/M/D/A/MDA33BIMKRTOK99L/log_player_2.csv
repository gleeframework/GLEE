You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's below your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly lower than her initial offer. It's time to accept and secure the product."
