"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true value and presents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its value. I'm open to negotiation but need to stay within a reasonable range. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I'm interested in the product, I can't justify going that high.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm keen on finding an agreement.  Let's settle this at $825,000.  It's my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
