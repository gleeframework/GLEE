Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or increases the chance of Bob accepting outright. 
* **Potential Profit:**  Since the product is worth $120 to both of you, there's room for a mutually beneficial deal. A price of $150 gives you a potential profit of $30.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John. This safety net allows you to aim higher with Bob."
