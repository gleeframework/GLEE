"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $75? That seems like a fair deal to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $100. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you!",100.0,Alice,5,
