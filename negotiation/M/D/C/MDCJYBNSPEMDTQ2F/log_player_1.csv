"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate and test Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is far below my minimum value. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. It's a substantial drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell for his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum value, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
