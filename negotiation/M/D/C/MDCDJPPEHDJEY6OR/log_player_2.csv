You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure if I should accept Alice's offer or not. On one hand, the price of $1,200,000 is lower than what I was willing to pay ($1,500,000), but on the other hand, it's still a significant amount of money. I'll have to think about it for a moment.
