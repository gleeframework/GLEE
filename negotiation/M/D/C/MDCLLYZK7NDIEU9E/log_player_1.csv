Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($11,999) aims to maximize potential profit. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** While the offer leaves little room for Bob to haggle, it allows for the possibility of Bob accepting outright. If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything as you'll sell to John at your desired minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no time constraints or costs associated with delaying the sale to John. If there are time pressures, you might adjust the offer to increase the likelihood of a faster sale."
