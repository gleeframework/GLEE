"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's very fair to both of us.  Consider this offer: $1000000. This is a price that allows me to maximize my return while still providing you with a significant discount. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
