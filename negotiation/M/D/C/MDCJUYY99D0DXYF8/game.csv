"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit above $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a compromise and get this deal done.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit, and $875000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
