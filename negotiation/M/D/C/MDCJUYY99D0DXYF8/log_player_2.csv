"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. You can use the negotiation with Alice to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit above $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so it's still not worth it to pay Alice's price.  You can try to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price, but if she won't budge, it's better to just buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit, and $875000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above your limit of $800,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for a lower price, it's best to just go with John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she is not willing to go any lower."
