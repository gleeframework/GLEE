Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels right for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit for Alice.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended and inviting.  This allows Alice to assess Bob's eagerness and get a sense of how high he might be willing to go.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice knows John provides a safety net at $1,000,000.  This empowers her to confidently negotiate with Bob, as she has a guaranteed sale if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move.  How Alice proceeds depends entirely on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
