"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer. However, I think the price is a bit steep. Would you consider lowering it to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer.  This achieves a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Seeing how Alice responds will tell us how much bargaining power we have. 
* **Anchors the negotiation lower:** By starting low, we shift the acceptable price range downwards, even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We've left space to gradually increase our offer while staying well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but slowly. Her offer of $90 is still above your target price.  It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if you can get her closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target her valuation:**  We know Alice values the product at $80.  Offering this price directly tests whether she's willing to accept a small profit to close the deal. 
* **Appears reasonable:**  By phrasing it as a ""fair price,"" we maintain a collaborative tone while standing firm.
* **Alternative is known:** We're getting closer to our walk-away point ($120 with John).  If Alice rejects this offer, we'll need to decide how much more we're willing to budge."
