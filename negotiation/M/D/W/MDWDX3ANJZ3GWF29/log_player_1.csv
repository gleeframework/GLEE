"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and my belief in the offered price. This can influence Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This initial high price sets the stage for potential concessions later, making any eventual compromises seem more significant to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Considering the market value and potential use of the product, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring him closer to my target while still acknowledging his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product, though our estimations differ. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and aim for a collaborative tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to justify the higher price point and subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand that finding a common ground is essential here. Based on my assessment, I would like to counter with a price of $1,275,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
