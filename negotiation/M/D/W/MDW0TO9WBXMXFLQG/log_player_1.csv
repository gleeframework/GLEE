Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, there's a chance to get Bob to pay your full asking price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a firm anchor. It signals the product's value to you and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but emphasizes your valuation of the product. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial offer."
