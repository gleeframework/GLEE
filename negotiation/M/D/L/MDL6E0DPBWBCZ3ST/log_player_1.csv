Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. What do you think?
