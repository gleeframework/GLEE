Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for compromise. This will allow for a potential counteroffer from Bob while still giving you a profit higher than your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $130 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $137.50 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider $135? It's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer $137.50,  Bob's offer of $135 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better than selling to John at $150, as the negotiation process will continue to take time and energy."
