Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it also shows I believe in the product's value. I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential interest without immediately resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away a significant portion of my desired profit. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,800,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin. It's a fair compromise, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, this is getting too far off track. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
