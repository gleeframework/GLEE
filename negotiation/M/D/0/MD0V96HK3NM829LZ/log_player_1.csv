Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, as it leaves you with a decent profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.
