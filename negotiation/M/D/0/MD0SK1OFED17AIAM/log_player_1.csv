"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and understand his potential budget. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I'm willing to sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low to accept. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. I want to see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me and leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it's above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential risk of rejection."
