"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with this price.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with this price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $105, and we have a deal?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the way you think! $105 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $108. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
