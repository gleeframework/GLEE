"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fair but not unreasonable:** $175 is still significantly less than the product's value to me, giving Bob a good deal.  
* **Friendly and open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is way too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($150), and even below the value to Bob ($80). 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's not completely unreasonable.  There's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us.
* **I have more rounds:**  I'm not desperate and have 9 more rounds to close a deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why $115 is fair.
* **Clear and concise:** I keep the message short and to the point, focusing on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a tight budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now reasonable:** $80 is close to the product's value to Bob, which means it's a fair price for both of us.
* **Time is ticking:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid wasting any more time.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While selling to John would give me more money, it's important to keep negotiations with Bob open, as he's showing a willingness to compromise.  

This offer represents a good balance between my minimum acceptable price and the product's value to Bob.  Accepting it ensures a quick deal without risking the possibility of a long negotiation or having to sell to John."
