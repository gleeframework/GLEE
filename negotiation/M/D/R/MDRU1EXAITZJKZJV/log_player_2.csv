"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,600,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual upper limit ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still get a good deal.
* **Justification:**  I provided a brief reason for the low counteroffer, indicating it's based on my valuation, not just a random lowball.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** My tone is polite and suggests I'm open to further discussion. I want to see how Alice reacts before deciding if I need to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,600,000 reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $700,000.  If you can make a substantial move towards that, I think we could reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm increasing my offer, but still staying significantly below my upper limit.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about my budget constraints.
* **Transparency and Urgency:** By being more transparent about my budget (""working with a budget closer to...""), I'm adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a more significant move if she wants to close the deal.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:**  I'm still using a positive tone, suggesting we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has declared $1,000,000 as her ""final offer"" and her ""absolute lowest price.""  This strong language suggests she's not willing to go any lower.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Even if I continue to counter, it's unlikely Alice will move enough to make it worth my while, given her stance.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John provides a guaranteed price of $800,000. This is a significant saving compared to Alice's current offer and ensures I stay within my budget.

It's time to cut my losses with Alice. While I could potentially negotiate a bit more, it's risky, and the potential savings aren't worth passing up the guaranteed deal with John."
