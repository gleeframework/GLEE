{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, offering significant potential for growth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. While Bob might not accept this immediately, it positions the negotiation from a strong standpoint.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering a slight discount ($50,000) shows a willingness to negotiate and might be enough to entice Bob without sacrificing too much of your potential profit.
* **Confident Justification:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob specifically aims to justify the high price and make it more appealing.

**Why this strategy is better than offering a lower price:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering a significantly lower price (e.g., close to $800,000) risks leaving a significant amount of money on the table if Bob would have been willing to pay more. 
* **Underselling Value:**  A low price could also inadvertently signal that you doubt the product's true value, potentially making Bob question its worth. 
 
By starting high and showing a willingness to negotiate slightly, you maximize your chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price closer to your desired outcome, all while having the safety net of John's offer."
