Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  It makes sense to aim higher with Bob to potentially increase your profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $5,000 markup (50%) is a significant increase, but not so outrageous that it would immediately scare Bob away.  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Tone:**  By stating you believe the product is worth ""at least"" $10,000, you subtly imply its value could be even higher, justifying your asking price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but remember, your bottom line is $10,000."
