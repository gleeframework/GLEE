Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $120 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great price for a product worth $150 to you.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $115?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$115 is getting too close to my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $115 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $120. This is still a fantastic price considering its value to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is getting frustrating! Bob keeps lowballing me, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I at least get my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $100."
