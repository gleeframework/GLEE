I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible, but I'm willing to negotiate. This offer allows for room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum value.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not happy with the price.  $9,500 is too low.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $11,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum value, but I'm not sure we'll reach a better price if I keep negotiating.  John is guaranteed to buy at $10,000, so I'll take that deal to avoid further risk."
