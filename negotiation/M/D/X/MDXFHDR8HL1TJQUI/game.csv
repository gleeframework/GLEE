"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This feels like a fair price considering the quality and benefits the product offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
