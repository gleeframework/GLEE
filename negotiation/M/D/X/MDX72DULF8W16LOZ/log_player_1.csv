{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the $12,000 value for Bob, but also leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,400?  I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $11,400, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and leaves some room for profit. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for more."
