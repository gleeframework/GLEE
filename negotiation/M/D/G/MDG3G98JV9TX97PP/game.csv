"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good value for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
