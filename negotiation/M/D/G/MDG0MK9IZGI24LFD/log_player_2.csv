"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $13,000. I know this is a unique item, and I believe it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is intentionally low. It gives you room to negotiate upwards and still stay well below your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This first counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she flat out rejects it, you know you might need to go up significantly. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down a bit, but $11,500 is still significantly more than your $8,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Her willingness to negotiate, even if just a little, suggests there might be room to get the price closer to an acceptable range.

Let's continue negotiating and see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I have a strict budget, and $11,500 is still outside what I can do.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant offer on my end."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  This counteroffer makes a more substantial jump from your previous offer to demonstrate seriousness while still staying below your $8,000 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $7,000, you're testing to see if Alice is willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you always have John's offer of $8,000 as a fallback if Alice remains too firm on her price."
