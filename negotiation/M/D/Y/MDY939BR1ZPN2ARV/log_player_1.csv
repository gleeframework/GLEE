"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to establish a good rapport. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll either counter with a lower price or consider selling to John if the negotiation seems unlikely to reach a favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. There are 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $12,000 is my target, I'm not in a rush to sell to him. I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to close the gap between our positions. 
* **Monitor Progress:** I'll continue to assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and consider selling to John if the deal seems to be stalling."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** This counteroffer provides room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move. If he rejects, I'll assess if further negotiation is worth pursuing or if I should move to John's offer.
* **Adapt Strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I might consider offering a final concession or sticking firm to my current position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than I'd like.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We're already halfway through the rounds, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** Although John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I'm determined to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap further. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and start considering selling to John if negotiations stall or time runs out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $9,300. It's a fair price for a product that's worth a lot more. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering a slight concession by dropping my price to $9,300. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value, subtly suggesting that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, expressing eagerness to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another concession or move on to John's offer, taking into account the remaining rounds.
* **Decision Point:** If Bob accepts my offer, I'll have secured a decent price. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We're at a standstill. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $9,000, and I'm hesitant to drop below $9,300. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to make a decision soon.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is significantly better, I'm not willing to give up on Bob just yet.  There's still potential for a deal, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $9,300.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make one final counteroffer, potentially meeting Bob halfway at $9,150. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but it also leaves me room to walk away if necessary.
* **Final Decision:**  If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I'll move forward with John's offer to guarantee a decent profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer the product for $9,150. This is a great price for both of us, and it ensures we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This counteroffer represents a final concession from my previous offer, showing Bob my willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm essentially meeting Bob's offer in the middle, signaling a desire to end the negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Benefits:** I reiterate the benefits of the deal for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Decision Time:** If Bob accepts my offer, I'll have successfully negotiated a price close to my goal.
* **Moving On:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $12,000. The negotiation has reached a point where it's no longer advantageous to continue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is far too low for me. It's significantly below my minimum and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, there isn't enough time to continue negotiating and try to reach a more favorable price with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides me with a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him, ensuring a profitable transaction.  It's not worth risking further time and effort with Bob for a significantly lower price."
