"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
