"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as 130. How about we meet in the middle at 145? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as 140. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at 142? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for this product.",142.0,Alice,5,
