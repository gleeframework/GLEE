,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a product you'll value. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
