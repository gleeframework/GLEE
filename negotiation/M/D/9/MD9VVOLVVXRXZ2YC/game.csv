"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is above your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
