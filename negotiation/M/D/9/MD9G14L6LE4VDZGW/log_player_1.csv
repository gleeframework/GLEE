Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for significant improvement:**  There's no realistic chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he's explicitly stated his budget. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal entirely and having to settle for the same price from John. 

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a successful transaction."
