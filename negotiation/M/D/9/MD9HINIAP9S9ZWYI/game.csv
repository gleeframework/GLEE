"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9250.0,Alice,5,
