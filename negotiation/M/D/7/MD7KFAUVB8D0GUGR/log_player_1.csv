"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$5,000 is far too low. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum of $15,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product.  I'm going to counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a profit.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time, hoping to close the deal with Bob.  I'm getting nervous about running out of time, and I don't want to miss out on a potential profit."
