Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for it. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay, and with only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get her to come down further. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
