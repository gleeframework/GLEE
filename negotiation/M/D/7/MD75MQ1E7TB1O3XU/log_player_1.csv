Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,200,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 splits the difference, giving Bob a good deal and me a decent profit.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept the offer."
