"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with significant potential. I'm confident it can be quite valuable to you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $800000 is a fair starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $850000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product can bring you.  Let's meet at $875000.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
