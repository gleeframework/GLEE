"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with significant potential. I'm confident it can be quite valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Opening with a high price allows room for negotiation and establishes your value proposition.
* **Confidence and Value:**  Emphasizing the product's potential hints at its worth without revealing your minimum.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counter, setting up the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. As the negotiation progresses, you'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** While it's tempting to accept $800,000,  remember you have 10 rounds and a guaranteed alternative buyer at that price. 
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. You can use the next round to explore if you can get a better price.
* **Strategic advantage:**  Rejecting early on shows Bob that you're not desperate for a quick sale and you're willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $800,000 is a fair starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Explaining the counteroffer as a compromise makes it more palatable to Bob.
* **Open to discussion:** The message invites Bob to continue the dialogue, keeping the negotiation alive.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is a tactical move.  The next rounds will require careful consideration of Bob's responses and your assessment of his genuine interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $850000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:**  Bob's offer is an improvement, but it's still below your minimum. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting, you demonstrate your commitment to getting a higher price. 
* **Potential for improvement:** There are still rounds left to explore if you can get closer to your target price.
* **Alternative option:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, so you have leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** Consider proposing a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's latest offer, but still below your minimum. You could aim for $875,000.
* **Assess Bob's interest:**  Pay close attention to Bob's messages and tone.  Is he genuinely interested?  Or is he just trying to get the lowest possible price?
* **Stay focused on your target:**  Don't be swayed by the pressure of the clock.  Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product can bring you.  Let's meet at $875,000.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  A slight increase from Bob's offer shows you're willing to compromise but not settle too low.
* **Framing:**  Presenting it as a ""small step up"" makes the counteroffer seem less aggressive and more reasonable.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reiterates the justification for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to how he reacts to your counteroffer. Is he willing to meet you halfway?  Is he showing signs of becoming frustrated?
* **Adjusting Your Strategy:**  The next rounds will depend heavily on Bob's response. If he seems firm, consider a smaller increase in your next offer. If he shows genuine interest, you might have more room to negotiate.
* **Don't Forget John:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This knowledge gives you bargaining power and prevents you from making any deals below your minimum."
