"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850000 is a bit low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $870000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",870000.0,Bob,4,
