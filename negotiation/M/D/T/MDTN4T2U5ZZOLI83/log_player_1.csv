Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $150, so starting with a price slightly lower could maximize profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is a strong starting point, there's room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he wants.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial to price the product above John's $80 offer to ensure you're maximizing potential earnings. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a high price and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely by overpricing."
