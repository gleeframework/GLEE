"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150, hoping to secure a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $140, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will entice him to accept while still securing a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell it to John for $150, Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum value and it's getting late in the negotiations.  I'll take the $130 and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
