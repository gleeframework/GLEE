"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a significant profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, there's a good chance I can negotiate a better deal. Alice is aiming for a $200,000 profit, but I have a $400,000 buffer between her asking price and my maximum. It's worth making a counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable outcome before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:**  Acknowledging Alice's offer keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Provides a reason:**  Saying the price is ""a bit high"" is softer than outright rejection.
* **Offers a significant but not unreasonable jump:**  Going straight to $850,000 leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also aims for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. How about $950,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but her counteroffer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than my target. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge her position (again):**  Continuing to emphasize understanding her side helps maintain goodwill.
* **""Meet in the middle"" framing:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that sounds fair, even though it's still closer to my desired price than hers.
* **Highlighting the concession:** Explicitly stating it's a ""significant move"" reinforces that I'm being flexible.

By now, we've established a pattern of back-and-forth. If Alice doesn't accept $900,000, I'll seriously consider John's offer in the next round. While I want to save money, continuing to haggle over small amounts might backfire if Alice becomes unwilling to negotiate further."
