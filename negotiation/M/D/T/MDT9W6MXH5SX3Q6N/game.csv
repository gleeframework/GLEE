"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. How about $950,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
