"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you wanting to negotiate, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $120. Let's try to find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above your counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to call it a day at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
