Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to earn the highest possible profit. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I need to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $14,000 is a strong starting point. It conveys the product's value while not being so high that Bob immediately dismisses it.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's crucial to consider Bob's perspective. He knows the product's value to him is $10,000. My offer needs to persuade him that the additional value is worth the extra cost. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John is a guaranteed buyer, exploring other potential buyers could increase competition and potentially drive the price up further. However, this would require additional time and effort."
