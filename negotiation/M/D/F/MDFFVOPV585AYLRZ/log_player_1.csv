I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this offer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, we can start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $10,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as I'm not going to get a better price. I'll accept his offer and sell him the product for $15,000."
