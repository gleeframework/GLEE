"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
