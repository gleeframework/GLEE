"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more careful with my budget. I can do $9,800, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $10,200 for this.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I can do $9,500 again, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
