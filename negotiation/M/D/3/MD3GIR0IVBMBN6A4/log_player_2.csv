The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000. This is a significant overcharge.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,550,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. John is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. Bob should try to push for a price closer to $1,500,000."
