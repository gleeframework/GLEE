"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $20,000, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I could go as low as $16,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering its true worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $14,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
