"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $20,000, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I could go as low as $16,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or just buy the product from John."
