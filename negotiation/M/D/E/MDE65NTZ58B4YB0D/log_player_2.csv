"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a price that's significantly below its worth to you. I, on the other hand, would prefer to sell it to someone who can truly appreciate it.  Think about it and let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John for $1,000,000 saves you a significant $250,000."
