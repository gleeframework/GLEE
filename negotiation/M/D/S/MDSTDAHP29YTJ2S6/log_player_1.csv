"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that this offer will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  We've been stuck at $1,150,000 for two rounds now.  While it's close to my minimum, I think there's still a chance we can reach a deal closer to my $1,250,000 counteroffer.  We're getting close to the end of negotiations, so I'll need to be more strategic with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant concession, but I need to show Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal. We're approaching the end of negotiations, and if he rejects this offer, I might be forced to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John.  We're down to the last few rounds of negotiations, and I've already made significant concessions.  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough to make me feel comfortable.  It's not worth risking the deal falling apart completely.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
