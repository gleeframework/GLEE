"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming for a bit higher than $9500. How about $11000? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate your effort, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose $10500 for the product. This price aligns better with my financial situation and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11500.  This is a fair price that's within both our budgets. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
