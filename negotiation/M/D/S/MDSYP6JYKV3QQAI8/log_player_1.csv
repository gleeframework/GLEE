I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point and allow me to potentially make a profit beyond the $12,000 minimum I need.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to adjust my strategy if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for something above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer slightly, and I'm close to my minimum.  Accepting his offer is a good compromise, securing a sale at a price that's better than selling to John."
