"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $140 is closer to your maximum price of $150 than it is to Alice's valuation of $120. This indicates room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffers can save you money:** By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price, potentially saving yourself money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint strategy:**  This counteroffer is in the middle of your maximum price ($150) and Alice's perceived value ($120). 
* **Reasonable compromise:** This price demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, while still offering a profit margin for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better than John:**  Alice's offer of $135 is lower than John's price of $150, making it a better deal.
* **Small margin:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the difference between $135 and your counteroffer of $130 is small. The risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate is not worth the potential savings."
