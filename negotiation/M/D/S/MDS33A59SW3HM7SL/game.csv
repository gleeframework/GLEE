"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal given the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential and benefits this product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at $950,000 or lower. Can we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe this product offers you even greater value, I'm willing to come down slightly to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $985,000, so how about $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
