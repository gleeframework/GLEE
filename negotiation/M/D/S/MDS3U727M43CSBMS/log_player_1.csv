This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a good profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob. It leaves room for counteroffers and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and negotiating style. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and continue negotiating or, if necessary, move on to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
