Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message, which might make Bob more willing to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $145 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $110 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $130. That's still a great deal for you, considering what this product is worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $120? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I will accept it. While I could go to John and get the same price, there's no guarantee John will still be interested later, and I've already invested time in negotiating with Bob."
