Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start with an offer above your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for John:** Keep in mind, you have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John. There's no need to go below that price, and it's good to have that backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's offer. Since your minimum acceptable price is $150, there's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob. Selling to John guarantees you reach your minimum price without the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing."
