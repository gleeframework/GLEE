"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but $850,000 is still higher than you'd like to pay.  You have more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and counteroffering again gives you a chance to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me though.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already offering a significant amount. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your previous offers and the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, it's getting closer to your target. It's also likely that if you reject this offer, she might make a counteroffer even closer to her original $850,000 offer, making this a good deal. With five rounds left, there's still some risk in rejecting the offer, but the potential to get a slightly lower price is outweighed by the certainty of this offer."
