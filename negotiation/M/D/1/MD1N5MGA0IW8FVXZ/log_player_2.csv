Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you only have 5 rounds left.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to reach a deal with Alice within your budget. To ensure you get the product, it's best to buy it from John for $800,000.  You've already gotten a good discount, and you don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether."
