"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $125.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $125 is higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You know you can get the product for $100 from John. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to get the best possible price."
