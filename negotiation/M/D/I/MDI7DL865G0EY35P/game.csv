"I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is there any flexibility on your end?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8200, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $7500, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between. Can you do $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can do $8100, which is the closest I can get to your target price. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
