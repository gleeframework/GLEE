"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to negotiate close to her initial offer. We should hold firm and see if she's willing to come down further. There's still a good margin between her current offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

We're nudging the price down incrementally while still showing a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the negotiation moving without caving in too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the limit of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she's getting close to her limit, but her price is still too high.  We're getting close to the point where we might have to consider John's offer, but let's try one more time to get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation and need to make a decision soon. By offering $11,000, we're meeting her stated minimum while staying under John's price.  This might be our last chance to get a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been thinking, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,250, just like my previous offer? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice won't go below $11,250.  While we could continue negotiating, we're unlikely to get a better deal from her. John's offer of $12,000 is now the more attractive option as it saves us time and potential further negotiation hassle for a relatively small difference in price."
