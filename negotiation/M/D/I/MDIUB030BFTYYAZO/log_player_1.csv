Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have the option of selling to John for my minimum, so I'm in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter to try and reach a more reasonable price.  My minimum is $1,500,000, so there's still room for negotiation, but I won't settle for that low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate but also leaves some room for further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable settling for that price. I'm going to counter again and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making one final counteroffer at $1,450,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway.  If he rejects this, I'll  sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I've already lowered my price significantly and I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000.  I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the best possible price for the product."
