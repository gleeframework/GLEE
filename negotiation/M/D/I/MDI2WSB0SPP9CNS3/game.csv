"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I can go as low as $15,500.  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $12,000, which would be $13,750. Would you be willing to accept that?",13750.0,Bob,6,
