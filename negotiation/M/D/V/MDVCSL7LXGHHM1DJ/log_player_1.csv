Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my minimum of $100. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counteroffer again, or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $100.  I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95, which is closer to my minimum desired price and also leaves room for some potential negotiation with Bob.  This price represents a compromise, but also allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge much from his initial offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum than $80, it's still below my desired price. To ensure I meet my minimum goal of $100, I'll sell the product to John."
