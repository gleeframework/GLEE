"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The initial offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below your minimum ($1,200,000). This tests the waters and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value,"" you set a positive tone for the negotiation and subtly anchor the discussion around a higher number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, as it leaves you with a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and you have a strong fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,025,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  Dropping $75,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but avoids drastic concessions.
* **Justification:** Reinforce the idea of ""true value"" to gently push back against Bob's lower valuation.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to meet somewhere near the middle of the current price gap, encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is still below your asking price, but allows for a good profit margin for you. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by $50,000, which is less than half of your previous concession. At this pace, reaching an acceptable agreement will be difficult.
* **Below Minimum:**  $900,000 is still substantially below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Time Advantage:** You still have several rounds left and the option to sell to John. This puts pressure on Bob to make a more compelling offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement here.  However, the gap between our positions is still significant. To bridge that gap, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer conveys a sense of urgency and firmness.  Calling it your ""final offer"" creates pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $50,000 reduction matches Bob's last increment, signaling a willingness to meet halfway, but only halfway.
* **Time Constraint:**  With five rounds left, introducing a sense of finality encourages Bob to be more decisive and potentially concede more ground. 
* **Backup Plan:** You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired price, providing leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's value.  I hope we can find common ground on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob continues to make relatively small concessions, and his latest offer is still significantly below your minimum.  It's unlikely he'll reach an acceptable price in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price. It makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Bob when you risk a lower final sale price.
* **Time Value:** Continuing with Bob wastes valuable time that could be used to finalize the sale to John."
