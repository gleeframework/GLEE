"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to consider my minimum acceptable price, which is $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,900. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob is still better off trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,200?  It's a fair compromise that will leave us both happy."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,200 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,500, which is the same price I initially offered. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $9,500.  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely Alice will budge further. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. It saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John, and it secures the product without risking a stalemate."
