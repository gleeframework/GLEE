"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",10200.0,Alice,5,
