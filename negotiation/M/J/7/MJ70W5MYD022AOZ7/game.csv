"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not convinced that this is the best price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,050,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
