"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  You can likely get the product for closer to your target range of $1,500,000 without having to purchase from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but the price is still above the product's true worth. There's still room for negotiation.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get the price closer to your target before resorting to John."
