Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's time to walk away from Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's stated this is her final offer. Even if she negotiates a little more, it's doubtful she'll drop to a price that's significantly better than John's.
* **John offers a safe deal:** You know you can get the product for $800,000 with no further hassle. 
* **Saving money is key:** Your goal is to save as much as possible, and John's offer gets you the product well below your $800,000 maximum.

While there's a small chance you *might* get Alice lower in later rounds, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and you ending up with a worse deal."
