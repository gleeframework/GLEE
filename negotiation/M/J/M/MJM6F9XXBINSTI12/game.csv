"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
