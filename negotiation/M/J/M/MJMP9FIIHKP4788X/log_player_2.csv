Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice has come down to $8,500. While she might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go below John's price of $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation, potentially wasting more rounds and ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
