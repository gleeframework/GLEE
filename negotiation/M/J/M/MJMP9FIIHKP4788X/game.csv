"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
