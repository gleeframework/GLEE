Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its true value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, but still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have multiple rounds left.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay my full price, I have the luxury of being more patient and selective with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for $950,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still keeping the price above his initial counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not in the range I'm aiming for. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Negotiation is a process:**  I'm not ready to accept his offer yet.  I have more rounds to leverage my position.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** The possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $920,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to reconsider the deal and look elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not close enough:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While Bob's message suggests he may walk away, I'm still willing to take the risk of pushing for a slightly higher price. 
* **John is a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:** I'll counter with a price of $930,000, showing further flexibility while still staying above Bob's last offer. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of closing the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $910,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $910,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and below the value I believe the product holds. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There are only two rounds left, and it's uncertain whether I can push Bob any further. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John. Although I'd like to continue negotiating, the risk of ending up with a much lower price is too great."
