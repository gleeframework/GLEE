Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.

Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet in the middle. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.  What are your thoughts?

Round 7
