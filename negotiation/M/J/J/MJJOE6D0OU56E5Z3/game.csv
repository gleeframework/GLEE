"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,050,000?  I believe that would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet in the middle. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.  What are your thoughts?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, anything above $1,000,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. How about we make it a clean $1,000,000 and call it a deal?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  While $1,000,000 is a strong offer, I'm still not quite there.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. That's a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that's both fair to both of us.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
