"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to my ideal value ($1,500,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation but also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  The $1,400,000 price is  a comfortable distance from both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This makes it likely he'll counteroffer, giving me a chance to either accept a better price or counter again.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, which can make him more likely to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob is aiming for a lower price, his willingness to counteroffer shows that he's interested in the product. I have more rounds to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 is my ideal scenario, but I still have 8 rounds to work with Bob. There's a chance that I can get closer to my ideal price by negotiating with him. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's $1,200,000 but still lower than my initial $1,400,000. I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,300,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" and ""room for profit"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely watch Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to consider if further negotiation is worthwhile or if selling to John for $1,500,000 is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. This allows us to stay within my financial limits while providing you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,250,000 is still $250,000 below my ideal value.  
* **Negotiation is still a possibility:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate by raising his offer. I have six rounds left, and there's still a chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Selling to John is not yet the best option:** While $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm confident that with some strategic negotiation, I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again with a price closer to my target price, but still above Bob's $1,250,000. My goal is to narrow the gap and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? This price offers a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($1,250,000). This shows that I'm actively seeking a middle ground and want to reach an agreement.
* **Moving Towards my Target:**  While still below my ideal price of $1,500,000, $1,325,000 is a significant step closer and puts me in a better position for future rounds.
* **Reiterating Compromise:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect of my offer, reminding Bob that I'm working towards a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000. However, I'm still optimistic that we can reach a deal. With only five rounds remaining, the pressure is on to make a decisive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $1,300,000. This price is higher than my initial budget, but it's the closest I can get to your original offer while still being within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is exactly the same as my counteroffer in Round 3. This signals that we've essentially reached a meeting point. 
* **Closing the Deal:** With only four rounds remaining, accepting his offer ensures I secure a deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** While $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price of $1,500,000, it's a significant profit and a reasonable outcome after six rounds of negotiation.

**Conclusion:** 

I've decided to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. While I'd prefer a higher price, the negotiation process has been productive, and accepting his offer at this point is the best option to maximize my earnings."
