Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal $10,000 limit. This shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $13500?  Let's meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $13,500 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm inching closer to Alice's offer, but still keeping it below my $10,000 limit. This shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation."
