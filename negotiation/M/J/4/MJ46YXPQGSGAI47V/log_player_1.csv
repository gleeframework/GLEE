Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
