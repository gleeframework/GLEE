"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a little further, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about $135?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's getting close to my minimum price of $150, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate.  I'm also worried that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away from the deal altogether."
