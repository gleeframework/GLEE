# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product offers significant long-term value that I believe justifies a higher price. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a more realistic compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

While Alice's offer is a step down, it's still too high for my budget. I will counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and a fair price considering the potential value for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
