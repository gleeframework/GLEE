"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $77? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",77.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $70?  That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal right now.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway! However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $70. How about we try $75? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",75.0,Alice,5,
