"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't quite agree to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
