Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still want to secure a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,000,000,  $920,000 is still a good price for the product, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and selling to John for $800,000 would be less profitable. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice in this situation."
