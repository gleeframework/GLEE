"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you, given the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
