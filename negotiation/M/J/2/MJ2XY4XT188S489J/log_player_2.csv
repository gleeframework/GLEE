"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by us. Considering its high quality and unique features, we believe it would be worth $100 to you. Let's work together to find a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is starting high, hoping I'll accept a price close to my maximum.  It's best to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($85) to see how much Alice is willing to move from her initial price. This gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a smooth negotiation. I acknowledge Alice's perspective on the product's value while firmly stating my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a common ground, how about we aim for a price closer to our initial valuation but still within your budget considerations? How does $95 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still closer to her desired price. We have plenty of rounds left, and I'm willing to bet she'll move closer to $90 if I hold firm. There's no rush to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree on.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm moving up slightly to $90, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also holding firm to get a better deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone throughout the negotiation is key to reaching a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're finding a suitable price. Considering the value of the product and aiming for mutual benefit, how about we settle at $93? It's a bit higher than your last offer but still below our initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $93 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than Alice's initial offer and a decent savings from John's price.
* **Time Value:**  We've negotiated well, and there's always a chance Alice could become less flexible. Accepting now secures a good price without dragging out the negotiation further."
