"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a deal that provides even greater value for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still within a reasonable range for both parties, while allowing for a substantial profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I still receive a fair return on this product. I'm offering to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
