Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Potential profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000) if you can sell to Bob at a price higher than his valuation.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to start with an offer slightly below John's price, leaving room for negotiation.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $980,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High starting point:** $980,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still a discount compared to what John is offering.
* **Sense of urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties (even if there aren't any besides John), you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While you're starting high, the phrasing implies you're open to discussion, potentially allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. How you frame your offer and negotiate can significantly impact the outcome. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
