"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be open to $12,000? It's a fair price considering my limitations and your desire to sell.",12000.0,Bob,4,
