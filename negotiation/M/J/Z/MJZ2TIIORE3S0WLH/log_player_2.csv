"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it at $20,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be open to $12,000? It's a fair price considering my limitations and your desire to sell."", ""product_price"": 12000}
