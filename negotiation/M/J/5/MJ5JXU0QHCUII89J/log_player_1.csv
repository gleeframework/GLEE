Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:**  This message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It sets the stage for a potential negotiation without being overly aggressive. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm increasing the chances of a quick deal.  However, I'm keeping my options open. If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer or walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. It's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground. If he continues to offer low prices, I'll be prepared to sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a significant step down from my initial offer of $1,100,000 but still above Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation but I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. 
* **The message:** I'm trying to be fair and reasonable while still emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I'm also hinting at the possibility of a compromise.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground where we can both agree. By offering $950,000, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to raise his offer while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate. If he continues to refuse, I'm still prepared to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's only $100,000 below my last counteroffer, and it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to prioritize a quick sale over potentially getting a slightly higher price.  There's a risk that further negotiation could result in a lower offer from Bob or that he might walk away entirely.  By accepting his offer, I'm securing a reasonable price that's within a reasonable range of my desired outcome."
