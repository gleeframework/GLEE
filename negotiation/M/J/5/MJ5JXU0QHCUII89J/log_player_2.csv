"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than $1,100,000. There's room to negotiate before approaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. It's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price gives us more room for negotiation. It shows we're serious about buying but not willing to overpay. This leaves space to gradually increase our offer if needed while staying well below our $1,000,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate before hitting our $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to Alice's price point while staying below our maximum. Offering a specific number as a ""middle ground"" can encourage Alice to accept, as it frames the offer as a compromise rather than a continued negotiation."
