"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is higher than the previous one. While still lower than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting allows for further bargaining."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers are steadily increasing, getting closer to John's price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is high. If Bob rejects and makes another counteroffer, there's a good chance Alice will reject it and increase her offer even more, potentially pushing the price above John's. 

It's more prudent for Bob to buy from John at $15,000, as there's no guarantee he can get a better deal with Alice, and the potential for further negotiation is risky."
