{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. It's a unique item with great potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob's interest. I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think.""

This initial offer is a good starting point. I can adjust the price based on Bob's response and the information I gather during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate the offer but $7,500 is a little too low for me. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $8,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and potential to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, expressing confidence in Bob's potential investment, and encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of him backing out or prolonging the negotiation."
