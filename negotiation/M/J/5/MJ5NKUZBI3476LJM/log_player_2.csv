"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $10000 for it. It's a unique item with great potential.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a backup option of buying the product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. There's a chance she's willing to lower her price, especially since you've shown you're willing to walk away."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate the offer but $7500 is a little too low for me. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8500. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you still have room to negotiate further. Since your maximum budget is $10,000, and John is offering the product at that price, you can still aim for a better deal with Alice. You have a solid fallback option, so there's no need to rush into accepting just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
