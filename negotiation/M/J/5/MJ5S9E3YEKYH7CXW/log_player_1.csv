Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your company. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This allows for a healthy margin for both of us and reflects the true value of the product. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I can realistically accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer still provides a substantial return for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price. We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, so it's important to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still below my acceptable range. I'm willing to compromise further, but only to $890,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to stay within my desired range. I'm committed to reaching a fair agreement, but I can't go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $885,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. We're already in round 6, and while $885,000 is still below my ideal, it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price.  It's time to lock in a profit."
