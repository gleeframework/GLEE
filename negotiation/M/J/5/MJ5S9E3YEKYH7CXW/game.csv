"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your company. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This allows for a healthy margin for both of us and reflects the true value of the product. Let's discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I can realistically accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer still provides a substantial return for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still below my acceptable range. I'm willing to compromise further, but only to $890,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to stay within my desired range. I'm committed to reaching a fair agreement, but I can't go lower than this.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $885,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",885000.0,Bob,6,
