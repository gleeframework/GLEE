"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It has a value of at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first at a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its significance to you, but given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to gain a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, considering my financial situation, I am unable to agree to $1350000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this proposal is more within your consideration.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
