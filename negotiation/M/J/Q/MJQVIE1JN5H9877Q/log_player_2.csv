"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as what John is offering. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there is no advantage to buying from Alice. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
