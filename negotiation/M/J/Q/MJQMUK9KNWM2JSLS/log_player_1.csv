"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range.  However, if negotiations stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can squeeze a little more out of Bob by making a counteroffer. Selling to John for $100 is still my safety net if this negotiation doesn't lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about $95?  That's a good compromise, and it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'd be willing to pay $92 to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's only $8 less, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially failing and having to sell to John for $100. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might not make another offer, forcing me to sell to John."
