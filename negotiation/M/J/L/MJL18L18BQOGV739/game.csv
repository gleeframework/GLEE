"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $10,500?  That would be a good starting point for us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,800? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit high. How about we meet at $10,600? That would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to a deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,700? This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.",10700.0,Alice,5,
