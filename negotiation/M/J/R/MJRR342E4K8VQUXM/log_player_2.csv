"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. While it's a generous offer, it's still not in your best interest. You have a better option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm only comfortable paying $950,000 for the product at this time.  This is still a significant premium for me and reflects the value I see in it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your preferred price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target of $1,000,000. You can still buy from John for that price if you fail to get a better deal from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but it's still $80,000 above your ideal price.  You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like further negotiation might not yield a better result.  John is offering the product at your target price, so it's time to move forward with his offer to secure the product at your desired cost."
