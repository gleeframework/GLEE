"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate and find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Aiming for Below Value:**  My goal is to buy the product for less than its value to Alice ($8,000) while staying well below my maximum budget.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message is phrased politely and suggests a willingness to find a compromise, which encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Value:** While Alice is negotiating, $8,500 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm aiming to buy for significantly less than my $10,000 maximum. There's space to negotiate further.
* **Alternative Option:** I can always fall back on buying from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but am still seeking a significant discount.
* **Targeting Below Value:** My goal remains to secure the product for less than its worth to Alice ($8,000).
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By staying firm, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have the option to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $8,000, which is the minimum I can go, but still a great price for such a valuable product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Alice's Value:**  Alice has signaled that $8,000 is her absolute lowest price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal for Me:** While not as low as I might have hoped, $8,000 is still $2,000 less than my maximum budget and a good deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I push further, I risk Alice walking away, and I'll have to settle for buying from John at the higher price."
