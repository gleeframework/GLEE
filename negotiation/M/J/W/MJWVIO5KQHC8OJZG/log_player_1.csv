{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This approach balances maximizing profit with ensuring a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  This still represents a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $130?  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. Since John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, it's best to avoid further negotiation and sell to him."
