"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that's significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""benefits,"" Alice subtly justifies the high initial price without explicitly revealing its true worth to her. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is high enough to allow for concessions in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above Alice's minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my own assessment of the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still substantially below Alice's minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation Remains:** There are still eight rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 serves as a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true potential of this product for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a substantial decrease from her initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the new price is still significantly above both her minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting ""Specific Needs"":**  Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's unique value to him, subtly pushing back against his lower valuation.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While moving closer to Bob's range, Alice avoids appearing overly eager or desperate to sell below her minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects the maximum I can pay while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Exceeds the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While Alice could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, accepting now ensures a quick and profitable deal. There's always the risk that Bob might lower his offer or that negotiations could stall.
* **Strong Outcome:** Accepting $1,400,000 represents a significant profit for Alice, even though it's less than her ideal target."
