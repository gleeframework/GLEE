"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. This exceptional item holds significant value for us at $1,200,000, reflecting its unique features and benefits. Given its worth to you is $1,000,000, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's start by discussing an offer of $1,100,000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price of $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
