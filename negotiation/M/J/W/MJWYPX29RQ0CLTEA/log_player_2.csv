"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would receive from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
