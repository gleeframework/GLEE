Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product without overextending myself. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This is the best option as it provides the highest return compared to Bob's initial offer while surpassing the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
