"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more in the market.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
