"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a higher profit, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, especially considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly lower than what I believe it's worth. I'm also keeping in mind my option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's lower than my initial offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate. This offer also leaves some room for compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit.  It's a reasonable offer, and I think it's likely Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I can still sell to John, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with only a few rounds left. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. With only three rounds left, I'm getting closer to his price point, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit than selling to John. This offer is my last chance to get a better price from Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to take a slight loss, rather than risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get a guaranteed sale and a reasonable profit."
