"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to establish a strong bargaining position. Even if this offer is rejected, it gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""great deal for the value"")  makes the price seem less arbitrary and might encourage Bob to counter instead of walking away.
* **Leaving Room for John:** It's unlikely Bob will accept this high price, but I'm not too concerned. I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $100 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum price of $100 and even further below my initial offer. Accepting would be a significant loss. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he's interested. By rejecting this low offer, I signal I'm serious about negotiating a better price.
* **John is my backup:** While I want to get the best price possible, I won't hesitate to walk away and sell to John for $100 if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I've made a large price drop from $170 to $120, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Using ""meet in the middle"" makes it seem like a fair compromise, even though it's still heavily weighted in my favor. 
* **Above Minimum:** This price point is still comfortably above my minimum of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is and his willingness to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $120 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $75? That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $75 remains below my $100 minimum. While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to be tempting.
* **Slow progress:** Bob is moving slowly in the negotiation. This suggests he might be trying to draw out the process to get a bargain,  but it's eating into my rounds. 
* **Time for a stronger stance:** I'll reject this offer to show Bob I'm serious about my valuation and that he needs to make a more substantial move if he's serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $75 is still significantly below the value I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point.  Would you be willing to consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm only dropping $10 this round, indicating that I'm becoming less flexible.
* **Firm Language:** Phrases like ""significantly below value"" and ""need you to meet me closer"" emphasize that I'm serious about my price.
* **Final Offer Signal:**  While not explicitly my final offer, this move suggests I'm nearing my limit and Bob needs to be realistic. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $110 still provides a buffer above my minimum, but the smaller concession increases the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to stretch to $80, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Limit:** Bob has stated that $80 is his ""absolute limit.""  This strongly suggests he's not willing to move any higher.
* **Unlikely to Profit:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely a waste of time.  He's already at his maximum, and I'm not willing to go below $100.
* **John is the Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100. There's no reason to risk losing this guaranteed sale by continuing to haggle with Bob. 

**It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John.**"
