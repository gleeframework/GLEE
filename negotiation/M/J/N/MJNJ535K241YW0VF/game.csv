"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $120 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $75? That feels like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $75 is still significantly below the value I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point.  Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to stretch to $80, but that's my absolute limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
