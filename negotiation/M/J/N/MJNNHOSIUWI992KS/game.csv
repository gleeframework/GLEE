"Alice,  while I see the potential value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
