Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I see the potential value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which meets my needs. It's time to move on."
