{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes Bob perceive any subsequent negotiation as a potential gain.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher final price than if Alice started too low. 

**Important:**  This is a single-shot negotiation. Alice needs to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting John's guaranteed price."
