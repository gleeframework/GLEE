"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the $15,000 limit Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant jump from $10,000 to $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Interest:** The message emphasizes that Bob is interested but wants a better price.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for a price in the middle between Alice's initial offer and Bob's maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. While $12000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $9500. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is lower than her initial offer, which is a bit suspicious. It seems like she's trying to push Bob down in price.  Since there are still rounds left, it's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to try and get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between Alice's $9,500 and Bob's previous $12,000 offer. It shows a willingness to meet in the middle while still trying to get a better price.
* **Fair Price:** The message highlights that Bob considers this a fair price that takes both their perspectives into account.
* **Negotiating Towards a Compromise:** This counteroffer helps move the negotiation closer to a potential agreement."
