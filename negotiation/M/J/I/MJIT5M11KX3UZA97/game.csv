"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. While $12000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $9500. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $10750. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
