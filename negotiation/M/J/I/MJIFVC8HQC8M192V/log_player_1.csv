Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! My initial price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $150, but still lower than John's offer of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly message:**  A positive and friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob could incentivize him to consider my offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Although Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides me with a fallback option.

**Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $160, which is still a great deal considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  "", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm reducing my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility, but staying above my minimum.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is my absolute minimum for this product.  It's still a great deal considering the value it offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```
