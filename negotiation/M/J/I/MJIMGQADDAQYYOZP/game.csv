"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is low, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $97 is still a bit low for me. How about $102? This is a compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for a product worth so much to you.",102.0,Alice,5,
