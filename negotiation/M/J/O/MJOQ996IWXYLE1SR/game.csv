"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering I can get it from John for $15,000.  I'm hoping we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
