"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal.** Although Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($800,000), it's significantly lower than your value for the product ($1,500,000). This means you're still getting a good deal, even if it's not the absolute best possible price."
