Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 initially gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **Not too high:** $100 is still lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, so there's potential for a deal.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $80, and Bob's offer matches that.  While accepting would be a quick sale, I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push Bob to meet me halfway or slightly higher.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always the risk that Bob will walk away, but the potential reward of earning more than $80 is worth the gamble."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $90 is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows I'm trying to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price point. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $85. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum selling price of $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob will walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John at $80.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and I might not be able to get a significantly better price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale close to my minimum price and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
