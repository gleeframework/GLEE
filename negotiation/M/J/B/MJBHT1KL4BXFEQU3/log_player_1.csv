Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's higher than my minimum and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to his price point, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price. Selling to John at $120 would be a safer option, but I'm taking a chance on Bob's offer."
