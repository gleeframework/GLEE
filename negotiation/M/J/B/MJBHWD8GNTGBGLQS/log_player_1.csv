Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $20,000 represents a significant markup but is still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob if he values the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. You can always decrease the price closer to $15,000 if needed."
