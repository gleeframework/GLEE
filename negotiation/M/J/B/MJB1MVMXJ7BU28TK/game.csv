"I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it, would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and time. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $108 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $108 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $106?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $107.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",107.5,Alice,5,
