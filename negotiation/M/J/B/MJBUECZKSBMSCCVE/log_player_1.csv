Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done.

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $1,325,000 is still a good deal and a fair compromise.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiations and potentially lose the sale."
