"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1450000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1650000. It's the lowest I can go without sacrificing my own profit margin. How about we try $1625000? It's a compromise that should meet you halfway between your offer and my initial asking price.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. How about we try $1550000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1675000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my initial asking price. How about we try $1660000? It's a compromise that should meet you halfway between our last two offers.",1660000.0,Alice,7,
