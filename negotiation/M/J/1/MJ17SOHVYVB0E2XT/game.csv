,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which reflects the product's value and the potential we see in this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I've done some research and I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",7000.0,Bob,4,
