"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you",130.0,Alice,5,
