"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $20000. How about we meet in the middle at $21000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",21000.0,Alice,5,
