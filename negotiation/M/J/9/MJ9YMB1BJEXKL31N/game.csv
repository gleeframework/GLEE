"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to the value I believe the product holds for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product has real value, but I can't go above $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to close this out and finalize the sale.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're eager to close the deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still sticking to my offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
