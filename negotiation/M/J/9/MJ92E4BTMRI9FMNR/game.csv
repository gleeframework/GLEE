"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $16000?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $16000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $18000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable with $17000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,4,
