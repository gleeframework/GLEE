"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  $95 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay right now.  If we can agree on that, I'd be happy to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
