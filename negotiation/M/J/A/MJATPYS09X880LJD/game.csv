"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $650,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $650,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I'm willing to go up to $675,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",675000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,7,
