(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear rejection of Alice's offer. $12,000 is far beyond your budget, so a counteroffer is the next logical step."

While $9,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point. You can likely get it for lower, and with only 7 rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate further."

``` 

While $9,200 is tempting,  you've shown you're willing to negotiate and Alice is clearly willing to come down in price. There's a chance you can get a better offer with more rounds remaining."

While $9,000 is a very good deal, with only three rounds left, it's worth trying to push for your target price of $8,800. If you don't succeed, you can always buy from John in the next round."

With only one round left, it's a good idea to accept this offer. It's very close to your target price, and you've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you won't get a better offer in the final round."
