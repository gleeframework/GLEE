Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that's lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $19,000. I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's the absolute limit I have in mind. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently shown he's not willing to meet near a price point that's acceptable. While he's incrementally increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000 within the remaining rounds. Accepting his $13,000 offer is a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations and take the sure thing."
