Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, the goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first allows us to potentially get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * **Significant Gain:** Bob gains $150,000 ($950,000 offer price - $800,000 value to Bob).
    * **Fear of Loss:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" phrasing creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he doesn't act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
