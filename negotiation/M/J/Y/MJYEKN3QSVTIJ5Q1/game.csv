"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1,100,000 is my final offer.  This price is still a good value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
