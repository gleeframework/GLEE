Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Value to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I'm willing to explore if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1,100,000 is my final offer.  This price is still a good value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price, reminding him of the product's worth. 
* **Finality:** I'm setting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and potentially lead to a successful agreement."
