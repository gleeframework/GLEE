{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that benefits both of us.  I'm also open to counteroffers and will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is far too low for me, and I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially get a better offer from Bob or secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
