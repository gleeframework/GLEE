"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for a long time and I'm confident it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run. If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss the details further.  Of course, if this price doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1500000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
