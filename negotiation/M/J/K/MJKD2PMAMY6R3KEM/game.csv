"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
