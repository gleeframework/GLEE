Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal considering its worth $1000000 to me.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and I think it's a good compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",870000.0,Alice,5,
