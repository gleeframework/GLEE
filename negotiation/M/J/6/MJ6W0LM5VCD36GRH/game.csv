"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be beneficial, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,150,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
