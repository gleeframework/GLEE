# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

This is a good starting point. The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and Alice's offer is way above that. It's worth negotiating further to try and save some money."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

While $1,800,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than the value you placed on the product. Continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."

While $1,750,000 is getting close, it's still above your value of $1,500,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, it's worth pushing Alice a little further."
