"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $106? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting stuck, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'll meet you at $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",108.0,Alice,9,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my target budget. How about we meet at $106? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",106.0,Bob,10,
