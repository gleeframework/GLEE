Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at ""incredible value"" to subtly justify the high price without revealing specifics about John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Goal:** The aim is to gauge Bob's interest at a price significantly higher than your minimum.  If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can still fall back on your deal with John."
