Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counter-offer. If he's very interested, he might accept the $150.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, ensuring you don't lose out. 

**Important Note:**  There's a balance to strike. If you start too high, Bob might lose interest completely. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged."
