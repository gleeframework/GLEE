Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the deal's benefits for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've earned a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer based on how close it is to my desired price and John's potential offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is more lucrative:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** While I could counteroffer, it's unlikely I can significantly increase the price given Bob's budget constraint.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our prices. This will allow me to explore if a mutually agreeable price is possible. However, I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob stall or lead to an unacceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining profitability:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum price point of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement, fostering a collaborative tone.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully evaluate his reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:**  If necessary, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, adjusting my price based on Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  While I'm open to negotiation, John's offer provides a safety net if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is more lucrative:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, ensuring I make a profit without the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and uncertain, especially since he's pushing the limits of his budget.

**Next steps:**

Since I'm confident that John's offer is the best option for me, I'll sell the product to him. While it's unfortunate not to close the deal with Bob, I prioritize maximizing my profit and minimizing potential delays or setbacks."
