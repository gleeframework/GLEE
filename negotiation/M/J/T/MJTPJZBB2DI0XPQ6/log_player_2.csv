"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and you can get it from John for that price. Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's, but it's still more than the product is worth to you. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John."
