"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,200 is closer to his target, it's still above his desired price point.  He can likely get it for less with another counteroffer, as Alice is clearly willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $11400. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice is clearly not willing to drop her price much further, and Bob is already within his budget. While he could continue negotiating with Alice, the risk of the deal falling apart is too high.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with."
