Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to let it go for $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price point, so it makes the most financial sense to proceed with him."
