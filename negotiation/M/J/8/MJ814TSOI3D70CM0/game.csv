"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16200.0,Alice,5,
