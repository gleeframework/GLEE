"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at $7500. However, I'm willing to come down to $8200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $7800. This is my final concession, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really pushing me to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $7500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $7500. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about making a deal. If you're still interested, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to hear a firm commitment from you. I'm offering it to you for $7500, and that's my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on.",7500.0,Alice,9,
