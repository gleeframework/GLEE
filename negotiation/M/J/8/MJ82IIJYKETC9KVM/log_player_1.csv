Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for some profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer. I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go lower than $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,900?  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of getting a better offer from Bob is low.  I've already lowered my price considerably.  To ensure I meet my minimum value and avoid risking a further decrease in price, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
