"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for some profit for me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go lower than $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,900?  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this deal. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
