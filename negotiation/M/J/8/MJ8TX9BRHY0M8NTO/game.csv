"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $8,000?  That's a great price for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want.",8000.0,Alice,5,
