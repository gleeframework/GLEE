Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price that's a bit lower than his estimated value but still higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
