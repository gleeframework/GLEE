"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential budget. This will also give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that this price is more appealing to him while still being a good deal for me."

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before accepting. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
