"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? I think that's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's meet in the middle, and we can close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, but we're still not there yet. We'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a bit more.  We're very close to John's price, so Alice needs to come down a bit more to make it worthwhile for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're inching closer to John's price. This offer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that saves us some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I'm going to offer a final price of $115. This is a fair price that is closer to what I'm looking for. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice won't go any lower and we're saving $5 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
