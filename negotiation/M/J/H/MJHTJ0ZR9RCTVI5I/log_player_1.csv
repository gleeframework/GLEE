Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above My Minimum:** It's crucial to stay above my $1,200,000 minimum (what John will pay) to ensure a profit.

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product for less than his perceived value, and I maximize my profit beyond my guaranteed sale price."
