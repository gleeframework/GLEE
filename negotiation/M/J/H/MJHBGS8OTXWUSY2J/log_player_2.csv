Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While Bob could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away. At $1,075,000, Bob is getting a good deal, saving a substantial amount compared to John's price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the product."
