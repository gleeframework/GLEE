"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
