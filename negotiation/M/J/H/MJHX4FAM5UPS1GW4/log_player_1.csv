Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. This is a great deal considering what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing it publicly creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. 

By offering the product at $9,000, I aim to secure the highest possible profit while still ensuring a deal."
