"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still leaves room for a profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
