"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product's unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial thoughts. However, I'm still not willing to go above this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We are still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,600,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my absolute limit. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this deal through with you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,725,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,725,000 is a significant profit over John's offer of $1,500,000."
