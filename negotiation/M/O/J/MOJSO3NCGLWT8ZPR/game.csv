"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective, the product holds significant value beyond $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. ",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
