"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair price.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  How about $1,175,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it under one condition: you cover the closing costs for the sale. This keeps the deal beneficial for both of us. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
