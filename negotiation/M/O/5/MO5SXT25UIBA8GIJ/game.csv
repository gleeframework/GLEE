"Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover some of my costs. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal.  $9,500 is close, but I need a bit more to make this work. Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
