Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but attractive enough to entice him.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* You can adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to acquire the product."
