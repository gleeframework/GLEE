"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit for me while still being significantly less than the value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes fairness and open communication, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay $900000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value to Bob and doesn't reflect the product's true worth.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  
* **More Rounds Available:** I have 9 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you to make a good profit and recognizes the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also making a counter-offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, I'm signaling a commitment to finding common ground. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential profit. 
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm still open to further negotiation if needed, but this counter-offer is a strong starting point."

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the value to Bob and doesn't reflect the product's true worth.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  
* **More Rounds Available:** I have 6 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price too low. 
* **Compromise:** By lowering my price to $1,000,000, I'm showing my commitment to finding a middle ground while still ensuring a good profit for myself.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize how this price allows both of us to be happy with the deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my desired price, and the difference is minimal.
* **Limited Time:** With only 2 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Even at $980,000, I'm still making a substantial profit, significantly higher than selling to John.

Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome with minimal risk of a deal falling through."
