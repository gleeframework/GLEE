Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm willing to sell it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price ending in ""000"" makes it seem like a round and potentially more appealing number.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $14,000. However, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit. You always have the safety net of John's offer."
