"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm willing to sell it for $14,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know John will sell you the same product for $12,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and saving the extra money."
