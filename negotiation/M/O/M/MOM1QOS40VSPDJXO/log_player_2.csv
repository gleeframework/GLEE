"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,020,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $180,000 compared to buying from John and secures the product. There's a chance Bob could get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, but the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on for too long outweighs the potential savings."
