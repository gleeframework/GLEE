"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
