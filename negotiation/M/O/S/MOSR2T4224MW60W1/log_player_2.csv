Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true potential of this product and  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.

Alice's offer is still too high, even with a reduction. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get closer to my target price."
