Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives us some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. However, it's still close enough that Bob might be tempted to accept, especially if he values the product highly.  We'll be ready to counter if he rejects, keeping in mind John's $10,000 offer as our floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below our minimum value for the product. We're not desperate to sell and have a solid backup option with John. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a higher price with Bob before settling for his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,250? It's still a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below our minimum value.  While we could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of going back and forth for several rounds without reaching an agreement. Since John is offering our minimum price, it's more efficient and less risky to sell to him now."
