Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim for a price slightly above Bob's valuation to maximize her potential profit.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I finalize a deal with another interested party.  I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Why this approach works:**

* **Exploits Information Advantage:** Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum price, giving her leverage. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly above his valuation to secure the product.
* **No Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and proceeds to sell to John."
