{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $10,600. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,700.  This is a fair compromise, and it's getting closer to what you're looking for.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've been negotiating for a while, and while you'd love to get it for $10,000, Alice's offer of $10,700 is within your budget and closer to your target than John's offer. It's time to close the deal and get the product."
