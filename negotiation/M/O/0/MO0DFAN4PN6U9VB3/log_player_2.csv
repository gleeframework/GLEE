"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Alice's offer is at your maximum price. There is no incentive to negotiate with Alice as you could end up paying more or spending time in negotiations with no guarantee of a better price."
