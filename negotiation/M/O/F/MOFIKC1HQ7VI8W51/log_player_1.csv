Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $900,000 is not terrible, it's far below my minimum. I have 8 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,050,000? This is a good compromise and still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied.  I have 6 rounds left to see if I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
