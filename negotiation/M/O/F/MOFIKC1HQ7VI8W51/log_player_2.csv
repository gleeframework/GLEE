```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,050,000? This is a good compromise and still represents a great value for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  I could continue negotiating, but there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up buying from John at the same price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
