Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
