# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer and still allows you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating to see if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
