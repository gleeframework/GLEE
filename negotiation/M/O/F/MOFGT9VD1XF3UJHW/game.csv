"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer and still allows you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
