"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more around $10,500.  Would that be workable?",10500.0,Bob,4,
