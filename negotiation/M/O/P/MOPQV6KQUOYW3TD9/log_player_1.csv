"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Gauge Interest:** The high initial price allows you to assess Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for future rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  Remembering that you have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price provides a safety net. This allows you to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is already above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation (Round 2 out of 10). Rejecting now allows you to gauge his willingness to move closer to your initial offer. 
* **Strategic Counter:** By rejecting, you can propose a counteroffer that gradually moves the price closer to your target while keeping Bob engaged."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a move in the right direction, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,900,000? It's a smaller concession, but I believe it's fair considering the benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($100,000) compared to Bob's previous move ($400,000). This signals that you're willing to negotiate but also reinforces the product's value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's benefits reminds Bob why it's worth a higher price, even if it's above his initial valuation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By countering, you keep the negotiation active and encourage Bob to respond with another offer, hopefully closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is lower than your previous ask, $1,750,000 is still a significant amount above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Testing the Waters:**  It's important to see if Bob is willing to go higher. Rejecting this offer will reveal if he's truly maxed out at $1,750,000 or if there's more flexibility. 
* **Time Cushion:**  With six rounds remaining, you have some leeway to continue negotiating.  Don't be afraid to push back a bit more before considering accepting an offer below your initial target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I respect that.  However, I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. How about we settle at $1,825,000?  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise from both sides."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  A $75,000 concession shows you're open to negotiation but aren't willing to drastically drop your price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer ($1,750,000) and your last counteroffer ($1,900,000), suggesting a fair compromise. 
* **Time Consideration:** As you're now halfway through the rounds, maintaining a balance between firmness and flexibility is key. You want to encourage Bob to move closer to your desired price without stalling the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Getting Close:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is still a healthy $200,000 above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000) with John. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob has consistently lowered his offers, and while he might still go a little higher, the gains might be minimal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push Bob hard risks him walking away completely. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
