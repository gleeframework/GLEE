"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm also looking to get fair value for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
