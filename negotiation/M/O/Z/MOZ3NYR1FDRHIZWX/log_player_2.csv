"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is below the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects both the value it holds for you and a fair deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his desired price.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and Bob will end up paying John's higher price. Accepting the offer guarantees a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
