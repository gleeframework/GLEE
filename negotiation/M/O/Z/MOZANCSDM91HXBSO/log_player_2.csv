# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is significantly less than Alice's offer of $12,000."
