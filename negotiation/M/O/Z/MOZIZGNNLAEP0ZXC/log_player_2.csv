"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price, and there's always the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, the price is still too high. I can continue to negotiate and see if I can get it closer to my target of $700,000. It's still early in the negotiation process, and I have multiple rounds left to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $750,000 for the product. This offer is fair considering your value and my budget, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $800,000.  While this is a good price, it's still not where I want to be. I have several rounds left and I want to see if I can get her to come down a little further. I can still use the threat of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for this product. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm impressed by your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $775,000, which is $787,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and her offer of $787,500 is now within a range that's reasonably close to my desired price point.  We're now within $12,500 of my target, and I have a few rounds left to potentially negotiate a bit lower. However, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $1,000,000 is too high at this point."
