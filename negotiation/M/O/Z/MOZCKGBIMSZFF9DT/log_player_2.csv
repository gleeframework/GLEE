It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a fallback option with John, you have room to try and get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 15% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down in price, but we can still push for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still want a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and it's likely we're close to her bottom line.  Accepting the offer saves us $650,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could continue to try and negotiate, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
