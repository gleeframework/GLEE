"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for you while also being fair to me.  Let's try to close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. However, it's closer to Bob's desired price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
