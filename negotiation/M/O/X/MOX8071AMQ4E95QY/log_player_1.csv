"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's potential aims to make Bob more willing to pay a premium.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to engage in dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown willingness to negotiate.  I believe there's still room to find a price that benefits both of us.
* **More rounds available:** With 9 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and explore a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for you while also being fair to me.  Let's try to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential to justify the price.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it matches what John is offering.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** There's a good chance further negotiation would lead to a lower price. 
* **Time constraints:** With only 6 rounds left, there's less time to find a better deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure my minimum desired profit, and I avoid the risk of a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
