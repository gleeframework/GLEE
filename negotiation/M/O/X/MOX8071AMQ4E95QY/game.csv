"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for you while also being fair to me.  Let's try to close this deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
