"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll meet you at $980000, and that's my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $970000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I've already made several concessions. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",970000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I still want to try to finalize the deal with you. I'll meet you at $975000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,9,
