"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to a deal, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,087,500? This is a fair price for both of us and I think it's a good compromise. ",1087500.0,Alice,5,
