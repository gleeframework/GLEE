"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's something you value at $80, and I'm willing to let it go for $85.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject the offer since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is less than Alice's offer.
