,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16000? It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $15850, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",15850.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay more than $15000 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $15000. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",15000.0,Bob,10,
