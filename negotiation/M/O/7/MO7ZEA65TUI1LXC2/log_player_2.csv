The price is far too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, hoping to establish a lower starting point for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $17,500 is closer to my limit, it's still too high. I will continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice.  There's still some room to bargain, and I'm not willing to give up yet."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin.  I want to show Alice that I'm getting closer to her price, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to pay a price that fits within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still trying to negotiate a lower price. Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm determined to see if I can get it down further. There are only a few rounds left, so I need to be careful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm hoping that Alice will see that I'm very close to her last price, and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. Alice's offer is only $4,250 higher than what John is offering.  But, it's very close to my limit, and I'm concerned that if I reject the offer, I'll be forced to pay even more in the last round. Plus, we've been negotiating for a while now. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
