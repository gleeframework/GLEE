Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,250? I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
