"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to negotiate further.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $10,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,250? I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
