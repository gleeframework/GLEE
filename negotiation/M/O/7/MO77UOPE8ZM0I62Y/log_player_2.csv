"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire a product that is truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and leaves little room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or resorting to buying from John at your maximum budget."
