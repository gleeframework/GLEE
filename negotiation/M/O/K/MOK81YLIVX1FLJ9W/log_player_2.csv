"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,000.  Alice values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product. This is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for Alice to counter if she desires."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer, it's still a significant amount.  Since Alice rejected Bob's counteroffer, it suggests she may be willing to lower her price further.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his goal of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $10,750. This is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. It's likely Alice will see this as a more reasonable offer than the previous one, potentially leading to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,400 is still too high for Bob.  He has already offered a price that was close to Alice's perceived value, and she's not willing to budge much. Continuing the negotiation would likely just prolong the process without a guarantee of a better price.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, it's a more efficient and predictable solution for Bob to purchase the product from John."
