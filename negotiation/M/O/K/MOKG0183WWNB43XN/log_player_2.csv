Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, the $700,000 offer is still significantly below my minimum.  To be frank, anything under $1,100,000 would be difficult to justify. Let me know if that price range is at all feasible for you.

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's unlikely Alice will meet a price point that works for me, so it's more efficient to buy from John at this stage."
