"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $11750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $11250. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's the price I'm willing to sell the product for, and I believe it's still a fair deal for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
