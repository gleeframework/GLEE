"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value and after careful consideration, I'd like to start the negotiations at $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget. I'm  very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I'm able to pay.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can make a significant impact for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. It's the maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering my needs. Let's find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still quite far apart on price. I've assessed the value this product offers, and I need to be realistic about what's acceptable. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, $1,300,000 remains outside my budget.  I'm very eager to acquire this product, but I'm unable to go beyond my initial offer of $800,000.  This represents my absolute maximum, and I'm hopeful we can find a way to bridge the gap.",800000.0,Bob,6,
