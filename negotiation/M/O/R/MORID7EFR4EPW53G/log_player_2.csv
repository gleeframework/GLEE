# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly less than your maximum valuation of $1,000,000 and the alternative offer from John at $1,000,000. Accepting this offer provides a substantial saving."
