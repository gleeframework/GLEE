**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, you can potentially get a better deal.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about $112 for the product? It's still a good deal compared to its value, and it addresses your concern for a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is only $2 more than my ideal price of $110. It's not a huge difference, and it's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  I'll accept this offer."
