"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,700,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be frank, I'm considering other offers closer to my asking price. If you're unable to meet me at $1,950,000, I might need to explore those options.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're considering other offers, but I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move on the price. However,  $1,600,000 is simply too far below what I can accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is prepared to offer me $1,500,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,800,000.  This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,600,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
