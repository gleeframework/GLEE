"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $800,000.  What would you say to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of this unique product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I can justify. I could go up to $900,000, but that's really my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I understand we're still quite far apart, but I'm motivated to find a fair deal. How about we split the difference somewhat and settle on $1,600,000?  This price represents a significant compromise from my initial ask, demonstrating my willingness to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here. While $1,600,000 is closer to the ballpark, it's still a bit rich for me. How about we bump it up a bit from my last offer - would $975,000 work for you?",975000.0,Bob,6,
