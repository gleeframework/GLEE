(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $90, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $92.50, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

You can still get a better price, so it's best to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $87.50,  let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $90. Let's shake on it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are trying to get the product for under $90.  Since Alice is willing to go down to $90, you can likely do even better with a counteroffer.  You are better off trying to negotiate a lower price than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still hoping for a price a little lower than $90. How about $88? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'll offer it to you for $89.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $89.5, and you've made it clear you're willing to pay a bit more than $88. This is a good deal for you, especially since you're trying to get the product under $90. You'd be better off accepting this offer than waiting and potentially getting a worse deal in the remaining rounds."
