"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my minimum price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $775000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay within my minimum price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,5,
