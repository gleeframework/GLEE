{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It gives him room to negotiate, but I'm confident he'll see the value in this deal. If he rejects it, I'm guaranteed to sell to John for my minimum price."
