{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $1,500,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your desired $1,500,000 as possible. You can adjust your next offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000 for this product.  It's still a good price for you, and a fair deal for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me. 

Instead, I'll reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still being closer to my desired price.
* **Highlight the product's value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value can incentivize him to increase his offer. 
* **Propose a middle ground:** This suggests a willingness to compromise and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still $200,000 below my minimum. I'm not willing to accept that significant loss.

Instead, I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. This will keep the negotiation going and give me a better chance of reaching a more favorable deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**
