{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. It's also important to be friendly and encouraging, letting Bob know that I believe in the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend significantly less than $1000000. Would you be willing to consider $500000? This is a fair price given the value I place on the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $500,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable amount.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $500,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm offering $650000. This feels like a fair price, considering the value I see in this product, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

While $650,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe there is room for negotiation. I'm not yet willing to settle for this price, as I value the product higher. I will counteroffer in the next round."
