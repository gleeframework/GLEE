"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $900000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit, while also giving you a good deal on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
