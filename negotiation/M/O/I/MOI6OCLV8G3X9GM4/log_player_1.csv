Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $900000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
