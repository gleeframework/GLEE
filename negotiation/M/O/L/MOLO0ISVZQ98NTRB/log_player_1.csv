"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so this is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit.  It's also closer to Bob's valuation, making it a more attractive option for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to push for more, it's unlikely that he'll budge further. It's also a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
