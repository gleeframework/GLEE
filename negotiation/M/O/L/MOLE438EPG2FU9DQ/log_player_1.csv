Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows you to potentially secure a price higher than $1,200,000, while still having John as a backup."
