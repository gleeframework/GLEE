"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $95. This is still a good price for him, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $90 is a good deal and worth taking.  There's a chance I could continue negotiating, but it's getting late in the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
