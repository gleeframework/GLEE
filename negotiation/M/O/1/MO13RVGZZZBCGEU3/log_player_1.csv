{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** This shows you're serious about selling to Bob and leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.** This gives Bob an incentive to accept your offer, as he stands to save money.
* **It allows for a clear point of reference for future negotiations.**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the price you initially offered. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try for a higher price.  You can likely get closer to your initial $1,400,000 offer by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product and allows me to get a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you are open to negotiation but not willing to accept a price significantly lower than your initial offer. 
* **Counteroffer is closer to your initial offer:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your desired range.
* **Message is positive and encourages further negotiation:**  By expressing understanding of Bob's perspective, you create a more positive atmosphere for continued negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **A reasonable price:** It's a midpoint between your last counteroffer and Bob's offer, suggesting a potential for final agreement.
* **Leaves you room for profit:** You'll still be making a significant profit, exceeding your minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, maximizing your earnings while avoiding further negotiation."
