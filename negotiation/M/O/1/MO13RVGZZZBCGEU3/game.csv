"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product and allows me to get a fair return. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
