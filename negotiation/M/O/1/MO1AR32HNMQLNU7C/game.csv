"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. It's a fair compromise, considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1100000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer of $1300000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product.,1050000.0,Bob,6,

It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.
