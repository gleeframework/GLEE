Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $10,000, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Is significantly higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is much closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum of $8,000, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Allows you to assess Bob's interest:** If he rejects, you can gauge how strongly he wants the product and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. A reasonable counteroffer would be $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate but not willing to accept his lowball offer.
* **Is lower than your initial offer:** This shows that you are flexible and open to finding a compromise.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still adjust your price slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's very close to your minimum, and you've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. It's likely that further rounds won't yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and move on."
