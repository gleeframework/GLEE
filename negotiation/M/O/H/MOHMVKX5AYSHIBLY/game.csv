"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still pushing my budget limits. I'd be willing to move up to $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a very good price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I could potentially make $1,000,000 work, but that's absolutely my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
