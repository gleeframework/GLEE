"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but you can still save $100,000 by rejecting the offer and negotiating further. It's unlikely Alice will offer it for less than $800,000, so there's room for negotiation."
