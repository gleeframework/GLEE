Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a decent starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to Bob's offer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. However, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
