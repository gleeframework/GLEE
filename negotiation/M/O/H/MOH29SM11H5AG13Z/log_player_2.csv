"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least that much to you. If you're interested, let me know. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product above its value to you. You know you can get it for $10,000 from John. By rejecting her offer, you force her to either lower the price or sell it to John. Since she values the product at $10,000, she'll likely prefer to sell it to you at that price rather than lose the sale."
