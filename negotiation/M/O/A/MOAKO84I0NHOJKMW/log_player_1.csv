Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,700,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product holds significant value for both parties, starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $1,700,000, there's a chance Bob might negotiate down, but even if he gets a reduction, it's likely to be above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing the justification for the higher price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the conversation open for further negotiation.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject the initial offer. You have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring you won't be left with the product."
