"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! My price is $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but still below what Bob is willing to pay ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also keeping the message friendly and optimistic to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $155? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
