"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product,  $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. This price reflects my understanding of its value and my budget.  I'm eager to finalize this purchase, so let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $700000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise and a significant saving for you compared to your initial price. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm proposing a new price of $725000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
