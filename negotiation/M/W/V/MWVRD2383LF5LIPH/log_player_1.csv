Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for something worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to compromise without immediately selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $130 is a decent price. It's above my minimum threshold, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away.  It's better to take the sure deal than risk losing both Bob and John."
