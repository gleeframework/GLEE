"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my absolute maximum. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
