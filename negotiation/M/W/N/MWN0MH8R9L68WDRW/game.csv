"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
