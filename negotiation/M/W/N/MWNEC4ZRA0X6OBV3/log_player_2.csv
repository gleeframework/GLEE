"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still above Alice's value of $8,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $9,500. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her price from $9,500 to $9,800, making her offer less attractive.  It's still better than John's price of $12,000, but Bob can try to negotiate further.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000. This is a compromise between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,800. It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price, and it might be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,400 is now the best option for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000, and while Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
