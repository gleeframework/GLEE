"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already said his final offer was $12,000, and Alice rejected that.  While Alice is willing to come down to $13,000, it's still more than John's price, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  It's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
