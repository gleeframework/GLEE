"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value of $1,000,000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher number. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,087,500. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident that this is the final offer I'm willing to make.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
