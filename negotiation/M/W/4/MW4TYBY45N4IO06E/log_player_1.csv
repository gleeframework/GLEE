Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value of $1,000,000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher number. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Although it's getting closer, I'm not ready to sell for this price. I want to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,087,500. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident that this is the final offer I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
