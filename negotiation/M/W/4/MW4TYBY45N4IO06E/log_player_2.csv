"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  $1,150,000 is a decent starting point, but you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value of $1,000,000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher number. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, we're still closer to John's price than our ideal.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,087,500. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident that this is the final offer I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for you.  You're getting the product for significantly less than John's price and only slightly more than your ideal price.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to close the deal without risking further negotiation that could push the price up."
