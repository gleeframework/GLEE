"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob sees value in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my initial price and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,380,000. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but still a good deal for me.  I believe this price will be attractive to Bob while remaining close to my target value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, $1,360,000 is still not enough. I believe I can push for a higher price and I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1370000}
```

I'll counter with $1,370,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.  Bob seems to be getting closer to my target, and I hope this price will be enticing enough to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

We've reached a point where the difference is relatively small, and I'm running out of time. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,365,000 is the best option, as it is close to my desired price and it's better than selling to John at $1,200,000."
