# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is misleading. While claiming to offer a discount, she's actually trying to sell the product for $150,000 more than John's price. Buying from John saves you the most money."
