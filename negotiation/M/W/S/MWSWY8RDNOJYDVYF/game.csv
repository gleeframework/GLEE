"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but no higher. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
