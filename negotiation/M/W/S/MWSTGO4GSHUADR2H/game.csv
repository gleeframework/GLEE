"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's true worth and provides you with significant value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and still provide you with a valuable asset.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would be a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This represents a significant increase from my last offer and is a price I'm confident is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This would be a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
