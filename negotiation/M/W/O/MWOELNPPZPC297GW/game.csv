"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows for a substantial profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
