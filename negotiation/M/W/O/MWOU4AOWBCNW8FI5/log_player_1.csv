Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I will counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not a price I'm entirely comfortable with.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, I'm going to take that offer. It's not ideal, but it's a secure outcome."
