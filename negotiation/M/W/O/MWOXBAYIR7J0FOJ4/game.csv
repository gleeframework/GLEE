"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $880000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth $1200000 to you. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $860000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.,860000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $870000. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $860000. I think that's a fair price for the product.,860000.0,Bob,6,
