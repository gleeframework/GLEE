"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more. I am proposing to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects its true value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $120, which is more than your maximum price.
* You have a better alternative: buying from John for $100. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
