"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $14,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still above John's price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

I'm aiming for a price between our last two offers.  This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving."
