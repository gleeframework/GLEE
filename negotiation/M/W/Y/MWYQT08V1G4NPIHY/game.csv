"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm happy to negotiate, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $108 for it. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
