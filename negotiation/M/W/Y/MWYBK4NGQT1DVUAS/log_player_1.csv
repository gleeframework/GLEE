Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the potential gain for Bob. I also leave the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and his potential negotiating range. 
* If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in my counteroffer, but I'll always keep my minimum value in mind.
* If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll evaluate it against my minimum value and my desire to close the deal quickly.
*  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I believe I won't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to accept such a low offer at this point. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, showing my willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his range.
* **Message:**  I'm  emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the potential for a win-win outcome. I'm also  keeping the door open for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* By lowering my price, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value. 
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide if I want to counteroffer again, or move on to John. 
* I'm using a  combination of price reductions and persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise so much that I'm losing a substantial portion of the product's worth to me.  

Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the best option for me at this point.  It ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiations with Bob that are unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome."
