"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price closer to Alice's value while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, getting the price down another $5 isn't guaranteed and risks losing the deal entirely (forcing us to buy from John at $120). Accepting $105 is a good deal."
