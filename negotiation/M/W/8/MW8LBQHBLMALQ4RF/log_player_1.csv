"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential for you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing everything. This piques Bob's interest and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By using the phrase ""starting price,"" I signal that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial deal.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to adjust in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $1,200,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my target and his perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my absolute fallback, so I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By moving to $1,275,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum and splits the difference between our previous positions, encouraging Bob to move closer to my target.
* **Clear Communication:** The message directly addresses Bob's concern about his budget while reiterating the product's value. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I am comfortable with a price of $1,225,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer to $1,225,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,300,000, this offer is strong enough to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $1,225,000 is a $225,000 profit, which is substantial.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has risks. Bob might not move much higher, or the deal could stall. Accepting now secures a very good outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. 
 
Overall, accepting Bob's offer at $1,225,000 represents a favorable balance of profit and minimized risk."
