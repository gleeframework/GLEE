Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that is closer to my minimum than to Bob's maximum, giving me a better chance of maximizing my profit while still appealing to Bob. 

This offer gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than John's offer, while also being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
