{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (making it appealing), and you secure almost the full value he places on the item.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$120 or higher:** Bob has no incentive to buy and would likely reject the offer.
* **$100-$118:** While you'd still make a profit, you leave potential money on the table. Bob would likely accept a price within this range, but you could earn more."
