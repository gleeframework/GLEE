"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer.  While $15,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $18,000 considering its value. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $16,500? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Bob,4,
