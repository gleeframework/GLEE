"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is my maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product.  This offer is a considerable compromise on my end, and I truly believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
