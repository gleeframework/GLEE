"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
