``` 

I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $10,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 
I'm offering a slight compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility and hopefully encourages Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still looking for a more affordable option. Could we discuss a price closer to $9,200?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,200 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe I can still get a better price and I'm not feeling pressured by the time constraint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows flexibility and hopefully encourages Bob to accept the deal.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage a positive response."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe I can still get a better price and I'm not feeling pressured by the time constraint. I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still a bit too high for $9,000. How about we compromise at $9,300? This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive from the product. I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

I'm offering $9,300, which is only $300 more than Bob's last offer. This shows a strong commitment to reaching a deal while still staying above my minimum. The message emphasizes the value Bob will receive, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Could we agree on $8,800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is below my minimum, and we are running out of time. With only two rounds left, there is a high chance we won't be able to reach an agreement. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's a better outcome than risking ending up with nothing."
