"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1600000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1520000. Can you consider this price?",1520000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1600000. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, but I need to stay firm on the price. I'm counteroffering at $1600000, and I'm willing to include a 5-year warranty and dedicated support. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the additional perks you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1550000. Can you consider this price?",1550000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1650000, and I'm willing to include a 10-year warranty and priority support. This is my final concession on price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm offering $1575000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1575000.0,Bob,10,
