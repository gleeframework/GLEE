Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys from you at his maximum.
* **Your Goal:**  Maximize your profit above the $1,000,000 baseline.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is appealing to Bob (meaning it's significantly less than his $1,500,000 valuation) while still maximizing your gain.

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You acknowledge the product's value to Bob, building rapport.
* **High but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 profit margin, which is substantial and encourages him to accept.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or counter-offer aggressively.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, try to understand his reasoning and be willing to adjust (within reason) to secure the deal. Remember, any price above $1,000,000 is a win for you."
