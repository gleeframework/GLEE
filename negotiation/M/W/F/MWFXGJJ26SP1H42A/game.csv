"Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'd like to see $9,500.  This price gives us both a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9200.0,Bob,4,
