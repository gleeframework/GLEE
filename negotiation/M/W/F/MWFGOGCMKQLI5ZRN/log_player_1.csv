Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. My asking price is $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to Bob, giving you some room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer matches the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product, accepting his offer is the best choice. It allows me to sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
