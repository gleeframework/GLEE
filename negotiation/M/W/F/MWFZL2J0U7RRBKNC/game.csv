"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, the product's value is quite high, and $7,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8,500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",7800.0,Bob,6,
