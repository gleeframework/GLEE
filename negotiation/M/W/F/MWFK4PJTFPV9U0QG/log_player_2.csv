"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear maximum price in mind.  There's a good chance you can get a better price than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Starting low is a good strategy. I'm offering $10,000, which is significantly less than Alice's initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
We're still in a good position to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm increasing my offer by $500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a lower price, Alice has come down a bit from her original offer and we're getting close to my maximum price. Accepting now minimizes the risk of getting stuck with a worse price from John, and it still saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John."
