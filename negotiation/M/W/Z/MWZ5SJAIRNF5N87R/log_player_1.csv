{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Addressing Value:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's potential gain to make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going for the absolute maximum price immediately to allow for a back and forth negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've maximized my profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price.
* **If I'm not satisfied with the negotiation:**  I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident that I can get a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob because his counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,350,000.  This price would still give you a good deal while allowing me to earn a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and highlighting the benefits for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent, I've secured a good price!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should just sell to John."
