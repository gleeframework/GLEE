Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower offer, but I want to see if I can get close to my desired profit margin right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500.  This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable value, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price. I'm not willing to risk losing a sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
