"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
