"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $8,000."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still above Bob's budget. While there's a chance he could continue negotiating and get a lower price from Alice, it's not guaranteed.  It's better to be certain of getting the product for his maximum budget by buying from John."
