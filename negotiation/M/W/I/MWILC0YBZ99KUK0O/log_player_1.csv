Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $8,000 to you, and to be fair, I won't accept anything less than that.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to offer the product at a higher price to Bob, hoping he'll go for it, there's a significant risk involved. Here's why this approach is the best:

* **Guaranteed profit:** I'm guaranteed to make at least $8,000, which is the product's worth to me. 
* **Honesty and Transparency:**  Starting with an honest approach can build trust with Bob. 
* **Avoiding a wasted opportunity:**  If Bob rejects a higher offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer. 

This strategy prioritizes securing a good deal with a potential upside while minimizing risk."
