Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $11,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to discussing the price, which could encourage him to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit!
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it, make a counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John if his counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  That's my top offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely a price between $9,500 and my initial offer of $11,000. This will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to reinforce why my price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $10,000.  I'll consider the potential for further negotiations with Bob, the time I'm willing to spend, and the urgency of selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. If you accept, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Gain:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob. It's possible he's firm on $10,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out and I'm not sure I'd gain anything more.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome as it allows me to sell the product at my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
