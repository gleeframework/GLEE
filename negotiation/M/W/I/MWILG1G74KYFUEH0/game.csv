"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  That's my top offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. If you accept, we can close the deal. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
