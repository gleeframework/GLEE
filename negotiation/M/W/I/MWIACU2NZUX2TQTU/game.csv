"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price though.  How about $13,500?  That's a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $13,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
