Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $12,000 is my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price though.  How about $13,500?  That's a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $13,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price and it's getting close to my target of $14,000.  There's a chance I could get a better deal in the next round, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
