"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This still gives you a significant value for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
