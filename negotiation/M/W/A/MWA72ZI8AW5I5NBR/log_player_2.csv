Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation.  I should counter-offer significantly lower to try and get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $9,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $11,500?

Alice is coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit high. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to the middle ground to see if we can reach a compromise."
