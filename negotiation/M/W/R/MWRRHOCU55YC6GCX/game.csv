"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $9,250? That's the best I can do for now.",9250.0,Bob,4,
