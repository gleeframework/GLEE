"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still $100,000 above your target of saving as much money as possible.  There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down to $900,000.  However, I'm still hoping to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit more. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my target price of $850,000, and  it's still significantly less than the $1,000,000 I'd pay John.  Accepting the offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John."
