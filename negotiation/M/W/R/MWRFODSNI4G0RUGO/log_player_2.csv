"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to us, but I understand its value to you might be even higher. To start, I'm offering it to you for $10,500. Let me know what you think!

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust our offer. I propose to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,200. This feels like a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I'm glad to hear that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose to sell the product to you for $9,300. This price reflects the value we place on the product while staying within your budget. I hope this offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $9,200.  Accepting this offer means Bob can save $2,700 compared to buying from John. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer or that he might not be able to get a better price.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
