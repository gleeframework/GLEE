"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,000,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
