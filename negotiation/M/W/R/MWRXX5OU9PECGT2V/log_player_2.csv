"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but it's still too high.  Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible, rejecting and counteroffering is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,000,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. It's a strong attempt to push for a price closer to Bob's desired price while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
