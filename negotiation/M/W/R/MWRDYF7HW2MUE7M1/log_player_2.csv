"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation, Bob can potentially do better by negotiating.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, but it's worth exploring before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderately aggressive counteroffer, but still within a range that's potentially acceptable to Alice. This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation, especially if Alice wants to close the deal. If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer further in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her price from the previous round, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There are still rounds left, and Bob has a solid fallback option in John. He should continue to negotiate, aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still staying below his maximum budget.  Alice has shown some flexibility, but likely has a lower limit than $12,750.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that's significantly closer to her initial valuation ($15,000). This suggests she's not very willing to negotiate further.  With only 5 rounds left, Bob is running out of time to reach a favorable price.  It's now more advantageous to buy from John for $12,000 and guarantee the purchase within his budget."
