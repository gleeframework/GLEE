"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $725,000. Would that work for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to make one final offer of $800,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move forward with another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
