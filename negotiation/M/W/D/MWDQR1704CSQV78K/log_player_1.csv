Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you and the potential you see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This sets a strong initial position.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, encouraging him to see the potential benefits of owning it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I am open to negotiation, avoiding a hardline stance that could lead to immediate rejection.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. 

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also below my initial offer. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring a counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially reaches a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise, moving from my initial $1,000,000 offer but still significantly higher than Bob's $650,000 offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price would still give Bob a good deal, highlighting the value he would receive.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message indicates a willingness to compromise further, suggesting I might be open to a slight adjustment if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal!
* **If Bob rejects:** I will need to assess Bob's response and potentially adjust my offer again, considering the risk of losing the deal to John if negotiations continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $725,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $725,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Time:**  We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and continuing to go back and forth risks losing valuable time.  There's a chance John could change his mind or another buyer might appear.
* **Potential for a compromise:** While Bob's offer is low, he's showing a willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I will make a final offer,  and if Bob doesn't accept, I will sell the product to John.  I will try to find a price that is agreeable to both of us while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to make one final offer of $800,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move forward with another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely. 
* **Strong Position:**  I'm offering the product at a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below my initial offer, highlighting my willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the potential time constraints and the fact that I might need to move forward with another buyer if we can't reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal!
* **If Bob rejects:** I will sell the product to John. I've reached my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially the deal with John."
