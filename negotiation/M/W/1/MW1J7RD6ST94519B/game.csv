"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.
