"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's a potential $100,000 profit margin for him. By starting at $1,400,000, we give him a reason to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit ourselves. 
* **Projecting Confidence:** A strong initial offer can signal the product's value and your confidence in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's a significant drop from our initial ask.  We have room to negotiate and multiple rounds left. Accepting $200,000 less than our initial offer in round 2 sets a weak precedent. We can try to steer the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle somewhere in the middle? I'd be willing to come down to $1,330,000."",
""product_price"": 1330000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** We're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing willingness to negotiate by reducing our price. However, the decrease isn't drastic, demonstrating that we're not desperate and still value the product highly.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're aiming for a price that's closer to our initial offer than Bob's counteroffer. By proposing $1,330,000, we're splitting the difference between his offer ($1,200,000) and our previous price ($1,400,000) while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This counteroffer keeps us well above our $1,000,000 minimum, ensuring a significant profit even if Bob manages to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we settle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer. We are still in a strong position. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to push for a better price in the next round. We are a long way from needing to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see you're serious about this purchase. I'm willing to adjust my price slightly, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Would you consider $1,300,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Movement:** We're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but in smaller increments. This indicates that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Holding Ground:** We're still holding firm above the $1,250,000 mark, aiming for a final price closer to $1.3 million.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtly):**  By mentioning ""realistic value"" and ""fair compromise,"" we're subtly introducing a slight sense of urgency, nudging Bob towards a decision without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand you're trying to find a fair price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we settle at $1,280,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly interested and steadily increasing his offers.  We've successfully negotiated him up from $1,200,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. We risk pushing Bob away by holding out for a price that's too high.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds left, closing the deal now provides certainty and immediate profit. $1,280,000 is a substantial gain over our minimum and a successful outcome."
