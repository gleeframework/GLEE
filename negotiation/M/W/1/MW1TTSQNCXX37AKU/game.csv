"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you coming down.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment on my part and bridges the gap between our valuations.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $700,000 is still a bit too low for me to be comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,
