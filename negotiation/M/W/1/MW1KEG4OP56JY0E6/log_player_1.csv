Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.

The product is worth $120 to me, and Bob's offer is only $85. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
