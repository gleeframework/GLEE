"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great price for you and gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $90, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
