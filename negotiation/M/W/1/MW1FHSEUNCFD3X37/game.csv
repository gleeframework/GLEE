"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle again. Would you consider $10,000?  I'm willing to come down further to make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
