Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

This is the best possible outcome for you (Bob). You're getting the product at the lowest price you're willing to pay, and Alice is getting more than you would have paid through John."
