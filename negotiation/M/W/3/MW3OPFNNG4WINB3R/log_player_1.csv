Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his maximum price might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant drop from my initial price to show I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below what I ideally want, but it's getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing if Bob continues to refuse to budge."
