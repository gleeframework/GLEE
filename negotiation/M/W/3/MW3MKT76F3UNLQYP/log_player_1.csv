Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strategic starting point for a few reasons:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It allows me to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, without immediately reaching my minimum acceptable price.
* **Signals value:**  It establishes the product's perceived value and sets a high bar for Bob.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for a successful negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 

I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if Bob will budge any further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,850,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still keeps me above my minimum price. It's a last attempt to see if Bob will meet me halfway before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  It seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
