"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000. However, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
