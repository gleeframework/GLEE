"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is far above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have the option to buy from John for $100, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to go beyond my limit. Since I can buy from John for $100, this sets a clear boundary for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. John's offer of $100 provides me with a strong bargaining position. I can continue to make counteroffers closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but am still aiming for a price closer to my limit.  It's a reasonable compromise and might be attractive to Alice, considering she values the product at $150."
