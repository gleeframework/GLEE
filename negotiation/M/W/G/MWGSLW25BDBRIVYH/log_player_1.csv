Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product less than I do, so I need to be prepared to compromise a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to accept that. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob, or move on to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is now above my minimum and closer to my desired price.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the possibility of getting stuck with a lower price or selling to John for $150."
