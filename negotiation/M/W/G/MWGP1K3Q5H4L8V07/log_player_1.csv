"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and encouraging.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing a ""good deal.""

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get a price as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. This strategy balances maximizing my earnings with keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, leaving room for a counteroffer that will hopefully land us closer to a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price higher than $100, but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $110? That's a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $120 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that $110 is a good deal.
* **Open invitation:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This approach keeps the negotiation positive while still working towards my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110. How about $105? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway is fair:** Bob's offer of $105 is exactly halfway between my previous counteroffer ($110) and his previous offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Above minimum:**  $105 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, making it a profitable deal. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer more. He might even walk away, forcing me to sell to John for less.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point. It ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
