"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,800,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my commitment to closing this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to close this deal, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made.  However, $1,800,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. ",1400000.0,Bob,6,
