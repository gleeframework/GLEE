Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer.  We are in round 4, leaving plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,800,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my commitment to closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to close this deal, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made.  However, $1,800,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now very close to John's guaranteed offer. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob in further rounds, there's a risk he may not go higher. Accepting $1,400,000 is a strong and fairly certain outcome, outweighing the potential but uncertain gain of continuing the negotiation."
