"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $7000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is still a good deal, and I'm confident it's worth it for you. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8500 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to make a deal.  What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,4,
