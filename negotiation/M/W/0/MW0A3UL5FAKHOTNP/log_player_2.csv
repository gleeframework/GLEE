"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget.  There's no immediate reason to accept.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $7000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is still a good deal, and I'm confident it's worth it for you. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $8,500, which is a good start. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
