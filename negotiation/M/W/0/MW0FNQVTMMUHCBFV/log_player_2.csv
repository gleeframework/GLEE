**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly not budging much from her $1,000,000+ position.  It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  While buying from John is more expensive, it's better to cut your losses now at $1,500,000 than risk Alice not budging and ending up with no deal at all."
