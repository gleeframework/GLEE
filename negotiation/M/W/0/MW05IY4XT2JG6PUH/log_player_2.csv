"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly lower than my actual top price ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Target Price:**  The offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives a starting point from which we can hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above my maximum budget and the price I can get from John. I'm willing to see if I can negotiate further to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Could we possibly settle around $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my current budget."" ,
 ""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Justification:** By mentioning my budget constraints and highlighting the fairness of the offer, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly below my maximum price, leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed, while still representing a substantial saving."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
