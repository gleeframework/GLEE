"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Could we possibly settle around $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my current budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
