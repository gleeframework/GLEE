Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below this at $11,500 maximizes her potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, the slightly lower price leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Accepting John's offer guarantees Alice $10,000. By aiming higher with Bob, she's balancing the risk of losing him as a buyer with the potential for a significantly better deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower to give more negotiation room.
* **Market Information:**  If Alice had information suggesting more buyers like Bob existed, she might be more aggressive in her pricing."
