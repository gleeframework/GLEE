"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), we establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, even if Bob is aware it's above market value for him. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give you valuable information for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early in the negotiation to settle. You started high, leaving room to maneuver. Accepting now signals you might go even lower, limiting your potential gains.  We need to see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Signal:**  Clearly rejecting Bob's offer as ""significantly below"" acceptable sets a firm boundary and shows you won't be easily swayed. 
* **Middle Ground (but Still High):**  $1,900,000  is a significant drop from your initial offer but still well above Bob's. This positions it as a compromise while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasize the product's value and *your* willingness to negotiate, making the counteroffer seem more appealing even though it's still a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is beyond my means. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate further.  While $1,750,000 is closer to your minimum, you're still in a strong position. We can push a bit further before considering accepting or walking away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates a serious interest in this product. To be frank, $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  However, I value your business and I'm motivated to close this deal. If you're willing to come up to $1,825,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  Start by recognizing Bob's efforts, building rapport and showing you're negotiating in good faith. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  While rejecting his offer, you're conveying that you're *close* to a deal. This can create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By phrasing it as ""If... we have a deal,"" you signal this is your bottom line.  This puts the ball firmly in Bob's court and may lead to quicker acceptance. 
* **Strategic Price:** $1,825,000 is a strong counter-offer. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer but keeps us well above both his starting point and your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,775,000 is a significant profit above your minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to move substantially higher.  His increments are getting smaller, and you've held your ground well.
* **Time Factor:** You've used half your rounds. While you have the John option, continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving you with a less favorable outcome. 

Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
