"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value and the benefits it offers. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $8,000, I'm aiming to eventually land somewhere between my initial offer and my $10,000 maximum.
* **Leaving Room for John:** It's important to remember I have the John option as a backup. If negotiations stall, I can always buy from him at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential benefits it offers you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $13,000 is better than $18,000, it's still significantly more than my $10,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing willingness to move on price. This suggests further negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Time Consideration:** We're only on round 3, so there's room to negotiate further before I need to seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. That would make it a really good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but not dramatically. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but not at any cost.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** My offer of $9,500 is roughly halfway between my previous offer ($8,000) and her current offer ($13,000).
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I haven't forgotten about John's $10,000 offer. By keeping my offer well below that, I maintain pressure on Alice to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Still Above Limit:** Alice is definitely moving in the right direction, and $11,250 is tempting. However, it's still above both my $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Negotiating Leverage:**  I'm willing to bet Alice is getting eager to close the deal. By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to push the price even closer to my ideal range.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory result soon, I can always walk away and buy from him."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That last offer was much closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at a flat $10,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that $10,000 is my absolute limit and presenting it as my final offer to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Meeting My Goal:** This offer meets my goal of not exceeding my $10,000 budget.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation. By putting a firm offer on the table, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **John's Offer:**  Alice knows I have John's offer as a backup, so matching that price might be her best chance to close the deal."
