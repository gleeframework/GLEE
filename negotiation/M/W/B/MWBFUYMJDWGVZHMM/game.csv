"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value and the benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential benefits it offers you.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. That would make it a really good deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know if this works for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That last offer was much closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at a flat $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
