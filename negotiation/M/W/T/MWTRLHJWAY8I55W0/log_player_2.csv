"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You can save $200,000 by going with John, and your goal is to minimize spending while still acquiring the product."
