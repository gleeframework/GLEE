"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 isn't quite in line with the value of this unique product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,200,000? It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for this exceptional product. Considering your budget and the unique value I'm offering, how about we settle on $1,175,000?  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction.
