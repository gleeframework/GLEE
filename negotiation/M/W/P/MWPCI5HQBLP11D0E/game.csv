"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, given the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,050,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your enthusiasm.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to bridge the gap a bit more and offer $1,075,000. This reflects my genuine interest while staying within my budget.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
