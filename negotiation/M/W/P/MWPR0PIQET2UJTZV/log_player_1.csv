Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer won't last long, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering it at $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still a substantial discount from your guaranteed price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
