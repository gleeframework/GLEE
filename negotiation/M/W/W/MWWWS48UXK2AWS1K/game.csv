"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $135? That's still a fair price for you, and it works better for my budget.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming down, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
