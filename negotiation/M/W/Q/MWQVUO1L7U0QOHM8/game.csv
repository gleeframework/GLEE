"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $750,000? I'm eager to make this deal work, and I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
