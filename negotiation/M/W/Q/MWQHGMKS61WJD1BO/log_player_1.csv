Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Bob only gets one chance to accept. This makes him slightly more likely to accept a higher offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000  leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his valuation.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  You could test different pricing strategies to see how Bob responds in further interactions."
