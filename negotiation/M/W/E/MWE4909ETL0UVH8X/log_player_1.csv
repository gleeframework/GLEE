"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,100,000 leaves a significant margin for negotiation while still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer serves to understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how he might negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob's counter-offer indicates a willingness to pay a premium over our minimum. We have room to push for a higher price before considering accepting or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum. 
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the ""true value"" of the product to nudge Bob closer to our desired price range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're aiming to secure a deal above $1,000,000. This counteroffer keeps us firmly in that territory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** Bob is moving in the right direction, but his increments are relatively small. This suggests he has more room to negotiate.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're on round 4 of 10.  We have time for a few more rounds to try and nudge him higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The difference between his offer ($975,000) and our desired range ($1,000,000+) is significant enough to justify continuing negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're setting a firm boundary at $1,000,000, our target price. The ""final offer"" language adds weight to this round.
* **Justifying the Value:**  We're reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 5, introducing a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Backup Option:**  We still have the option to go to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $965,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's increments are getting smaller.  It's unlikely we'll get much higher than $965,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost.  Accepting now gets us the money sooner. 
* **Solid Profit:**  $965,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum acceptable price and is a good deal overall. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Holding out for more risks Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer."
