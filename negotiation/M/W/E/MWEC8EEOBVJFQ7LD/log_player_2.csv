Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try again? I'm willing to offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and ending up with a price closer to John's offer anyway.  Buying from John guarantees I stay within my $100 budget."
