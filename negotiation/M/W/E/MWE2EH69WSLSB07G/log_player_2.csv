Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so how about we try $101?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go below $101, and we're running out of rounds. Buying from John for $120 is the safer option at this point to ensure we get the product."
