Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's our best alternative (selling to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at that price or lower guarantees he'll buy, but leaves money on the table for you.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $145 gives Bob the feeling of getting a slight discount while still securing a significant profit for you. This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
