"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John for $1,000,000. There's no immediate need to accept this offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, which is just $15000 above your latest offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?
