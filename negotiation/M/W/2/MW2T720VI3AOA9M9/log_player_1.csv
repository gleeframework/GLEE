Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, Bob's higher valuation offers a chance to earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice ($200,000 above her minimum) while still being very appealing to Bob, who values it at $1,500,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
