"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1400000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
