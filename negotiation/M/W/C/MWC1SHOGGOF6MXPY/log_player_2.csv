Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You're still trying to get the product for less than $100. Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $107.50 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You are close to reaching your goal but Alice is still offering more than $100. It's better to buy the product from John and save time and energy, since you are happy with his offer and are sure you'll get the product at a price that works for you."
