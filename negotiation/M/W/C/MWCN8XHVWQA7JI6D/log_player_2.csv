"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer significantly closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  Offering $1,000,000 is a strong opening move. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a significant discount to proceed. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer gives me space to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects it.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, but clearly states my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your budget, but you can still try to negotiate a better price. Since you have a backup option with John, it makes sense to push for a lower price before considering Alice's current offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,050,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Instead of a large jump, we're moving in smaller increments to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to budge much from $1,150,000, we might be better off going with John. 
* **Maintaining Interest:** The tone remains positive and collaborative to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer of $1,100,000 is now below your backup option of buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice could walk away from the negotiation. Accepting at $1,100,000 secures a good deal and avoids the possibility of missing out on the product altogether."
