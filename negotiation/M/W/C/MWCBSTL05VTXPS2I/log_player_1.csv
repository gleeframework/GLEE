Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations.  While she could continue negotiating, his ""final offer"" language suggests there's little room left for significant movement. Accepting $1,100,000 would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. It's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
