"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my initial asking price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while it's moved closer to my budget, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,625,000. This price aims to strike a balance between the value of the product and my financial capacity. I hope we can continue our discussion towards reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
