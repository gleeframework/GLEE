"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value and the benefits it provides, we believe it's worth $12,000 to us. However, considering the importance of making this opportunity accessible to you, I am willing to extend a special offer. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $9,500? This price not only reflects the quality and value of the product but also allows us to maintain a fair profit margin. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, or you can go with John's offer."
