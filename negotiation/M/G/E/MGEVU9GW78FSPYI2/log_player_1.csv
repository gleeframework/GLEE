Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal. My initial offer is $1,400,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and allows us to both come out ahead. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 8 rounds remaining and can leverage the pressure of the John offer to motivate Bob to move higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, we are still far from my ideal price and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I have 6 rounds left and still have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher amount. I believe I can push Bob further by making a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,325,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,337,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary concerns. I am willing to consider an offer of $1,330,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation has stalled. Bob's offers have been creeping up, but they are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not closing a deal and losing out on a sale to John is too high.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a profit and removes the uncertainty of further negotiation."
