Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($15,000) as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for less.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product slightly below Alice's minimum allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming high. 

**The Strategy:**

The message aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while maximizing Alice's potential profit. If Bob accepts, Alice gets almost her full asking price. If Bob rejects, she can confidently sell to John."
