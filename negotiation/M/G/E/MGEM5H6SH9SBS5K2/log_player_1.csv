Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 (her product's value to her).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as close to $1,200,000 from Bob as possible. There's no reason to go lower, as she'll get her desired price from John anyway.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe it holds significant value for you.  Given its unique nature, I'm pricing it at $1,195,000."",
""product_price"": 1195000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob doesn't act.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlights the product's worth to Bob specifically.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is slightly below Bob's maximum, making it attractive while still leaving room for negotiation. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate slightly upward, but never below her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Walk-Away Power:**  Alice's guaranteed sale to John gives her the power to walk away from a deal with Bob if he doesn't meet her price requirements."
