"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1100000 is simply too far below the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can bring to your operations. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial solution. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
