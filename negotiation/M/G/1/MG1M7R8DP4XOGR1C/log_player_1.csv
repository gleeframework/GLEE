{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your operations. I believe this price reflects the potential value you see in the product, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer allows for negotiation, but it also sets a strong starting point.  I am offering a price that is within the ""zone of possible agreement"" (between my $1,500,000 minimum and Bob's $1,000,000 value). 

I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can bring to your operations. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial solution. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of maximizing my earnings while staying within a reasonable negotiating range. This counteroffer shows I'm flexible, but I'm also firm on the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000 for the product. This price allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, while still keeping my investment within my desired range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1,135,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end and is the best I can do. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to move on to other potential buyers. "", ""product_price"": 1135000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm making a small concession to show I'm serious about striking a deal with Bob, but I'm still standing my ground on the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll go with John and secure my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1130000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that allows us to move closer to each other's positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've reached my limit for negotiation. I'm going to sell to John and secure my desired price."
