"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than you're willing to pay and even more than its value to Alice. You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but could you come down on the price a bit?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to establish a much lower price point. By starting significantly lower than your actual maximum, you leave room for negotiation while gauging Alice's flexibility.  The message also keeps the tone polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $140 is still significantly higher than your $80 limit. It's clear you'll need to continue negotiating to reach a price that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However,  $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer continues to move towards a more reasonable price point.  We're still low-balling a bit to allow room for negotiation, but pushing slightly closer to our actual maximum.  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price."
