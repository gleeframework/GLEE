"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $9,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I think the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,500? That's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,5,
