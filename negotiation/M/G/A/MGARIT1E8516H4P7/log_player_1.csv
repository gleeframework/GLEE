I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still potentially attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. It gives us room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident that we'll reach an agreement that's better than what John is offering. It's better to sell to John and guarantee a price that meets my minimum."
