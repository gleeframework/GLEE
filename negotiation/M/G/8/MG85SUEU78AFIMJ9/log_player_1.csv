"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make more than my minimum of $8,000.  I also want to gauge Bob's interest level early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a higher price.  $9,500 is close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can push for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,750. It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come down to $9,400. While it's a bit less than my previous counteroffer, it's still a good price and above my minimum. I'm worried that if I continue to reject offers, I might end up with a lower price or run out of rounds.  It's better to secure a decent profit now than risk losing a sale."
