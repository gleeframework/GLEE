"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this works for you!",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. Let me know if this works for you!",925000.0,Alice,5,
