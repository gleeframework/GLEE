"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a price that's fair to both of us, and it allows you to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still within your budget. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
