Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:**  I need at least $1,000,000 for the product, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Potential upside:**  By offering $1,500,000, I'm aiming for a 50% profit margin. This is a significant profit, but it's also within the realm of reason for a product worth at least $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, if he does, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This offers a balance between maximizing potential earnings and mitigating potential losses.

This is a strategic offer that aims to maximize profits while still considering the possibility of rejection."
