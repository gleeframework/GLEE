Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 at this point.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to earn more, so it's best to sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
