"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000, so there's no risk in starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, as I'm coming down from my initial offer of $15,000, but I'm still above my minimum price. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is only $500 less than my minimum. I'm confident that I can find a buyer for $12,000 if I need to, so I'll take the $12,500."
