``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $150,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation without significantly compromising my desired profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, creating a good atmosphere for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:**  While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my desired minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical decision. It allows me to achieve my desired financial outcome while avoiding the risk of a deal with Bob that would result in a substantial loss."
