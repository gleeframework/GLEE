Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John. 

By offering the product at $119, we are aiming for a price just below our guaranteed sale price while still exceeding Bob's valuation. This gives us the best chance of maximizing profit."
