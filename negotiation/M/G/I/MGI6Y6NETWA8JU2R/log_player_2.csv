"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, you know you have John as a backup option. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to your ideal price point.  You're willing to risk losing the deal to potentially save $100,000."
