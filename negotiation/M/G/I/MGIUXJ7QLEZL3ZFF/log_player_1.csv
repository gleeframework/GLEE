Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a common tactic to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Unknown value to Bob:** Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming high initially.  This allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Back-up option:**  Having John as a backup buyer with a guaranteed $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always secure that amount. 

**Next steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to determine if his counteroffer is worth pursuing, or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than my initial offer of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get a higher price if I continue the negotiations. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. The potential reward outweighs the risk at this point.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer of $1,200,000 and my initial offer of $1,500,000. I'll need to consider his negotiating style and my own assessment of the product's value to him to determine the optimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $1,200,000 and my initial offer of $1,500,000. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a strong position. 
* **Signaling flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob while ensuring I don't give away too much value.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to increase my chances of a successful deal with Bob while still staying within my acceptable range. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess his negotiating style and potentially adjust my strategy.
* If he accepts, I'll have secured a price closer to my initial goal. 
* If the negotiations continue, I'll continue to use a similar strategy, adjusting my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and my assessment of the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited upside:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 higher than his previous offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge significantly further. 
* **Acceptable price:** While $1,250,000 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and represents a decent profit.
* **Risk of deadlock:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of a deadlock, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.

**Next steps:**

* I've chosen to accept Bob's offer to secure a solid price and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might lead to a lower outcome."
