``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **You can still make a profit:**  Even at $950,000, you're still getting the product for less than your maximum value of $1,000,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
