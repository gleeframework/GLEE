"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way to $90, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",95.0,Alice,5,
