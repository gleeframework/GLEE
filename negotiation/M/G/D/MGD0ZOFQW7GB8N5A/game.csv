"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features you've highlighted, $500000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to pay.  Given my budget and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a substantial sale.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
