"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what others have paid, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something mutually beneficial. What do you think about starting at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, $100 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
