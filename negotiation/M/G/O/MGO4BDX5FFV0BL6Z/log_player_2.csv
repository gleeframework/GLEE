"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than his budget and he can get the product for a better price from either John or by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Would you be interested in taking it from there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is better than $14,000, it's still more than his budget and he can get the product for a better price from John. He should try negotiating with Alice further or go with John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you as you're getting more than what you're willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to go slightly lower, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  John has consistently offered a price within Bob's budget, and there's no risk of further negotiation or rejection. 

At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to further price reductions, but it also risks losing the deal altogether or prolonging the process.  John provides a reliable and affordable alternative."
