"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Would you be interested in taking it from there?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you as you're getting more than what you're willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to go slightly lower, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
