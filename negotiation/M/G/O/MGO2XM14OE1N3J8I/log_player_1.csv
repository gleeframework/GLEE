"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and might make Bob perceive a better deal later. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing specific details about my minimum.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  I'm prepared to gradually lower my price during the negotiation but will keep John's offer in mind as a profitable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. Bob's message indicates interest and a willingness to negotiate. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and bridge the gap towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant undervaluation for a product with this much potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle at $1,950,000?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Meeting Bob halfway demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but holds firm on a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm subtly reiterating the product's ""potential"" to keep Bob engaged and focused on its upside.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation toward a price point between $1,950,000 and $1,800,000, which would be a win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and John's offer. It's worth seeing if Bob is willing to go higher, especially since he acknowledged my compromise in his message. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be mindful of not dropping the price too drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I believe we're getting closer. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm making a notable price reduction ($100,000) but framing it as a significant move to demonstrate progress in the negotiation.
* **Appeal to Ego:** Praising Bob (""capable hands"") might make him more receptive and willing to finalize the deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  While closer to my minimum, the offer still provides some buffer for potential further negotiation while staying above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to offer $1,650,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,650,000 is a strong price, exceeding my minimum ($1,500,000) and significantly surpassing Bob's initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and eliminates the uncertainty of further rounds. While John's offer is a fallback, securing a profit above my minimum with Bob is preferable."
