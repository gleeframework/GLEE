"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This would still give you a great deal and ensure I get a fair price for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate you moving closer.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
