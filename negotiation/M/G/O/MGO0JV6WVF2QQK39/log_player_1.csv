Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while still positioning me favorably.
* **Positive Messaging:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By leaving a gap between my starting price and my minimum, I encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Option to Walk Away:**  I can always sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price. This could incentivize Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This would still give you a great deal and ensure I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that the price still offers a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and avoids putting pressure on Bob. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer provides a reasonable starting point for the next round of negotiations. If Bob rejects it, I can adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum, meaning there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 would guarantee my minimum, I don't want to miss out on a potentially better price with Bob.

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap and leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate you moving closer.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer positions the price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. The message clearly indicates it's my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,000,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.  
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to close the deal with Bob without significantly compromising my bottom line. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
