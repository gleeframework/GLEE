{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Messaging:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider lowering my price slightly, but I won't go below $150.
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'll ultimately go with John's offer of $150 to ensure I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  He's shown interest, and his counteroffer suggests he might be willing to pay a bit more. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer. I'll consider lowering my price slightly from the initial $175, but I won't go below $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $145? It's still a great price for a quality product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($120) and my initial offer ($175).
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality and value to justify the price. 
* **Maintaining a Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price ($150). 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider lowering my price slightly more, but I won't go below $150. If negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I still think we can reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to sell the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Possibility of Better Outcome:**  While Bob's offer is closer, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John for $150.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, again aiming for a compromise but still staying above my minimum.  I might offer something like $140.
* **Sell to John (if necessary):** If negotiations with Bob stall, I'll move forward with John's offer to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $130 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be interested in $135? It's a fair price considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise again, this time splitting the difference between $130 and $140.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but also demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to decide whether to make a final counteroffer (possibly offering $130) or to sell to John for $150. I'll consider the potential risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose $132 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my minimum, I've already made several concessions and we're at a stalemate. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dragging out the process and potentially getting stuck at a lower price.
* **Guarantee of Minimum:** John's offer of $150 provides me with a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely inform Bob that I'm going to accept John's offer, thanking him for his time. 
* I'll finalize the sale with John and move on."
