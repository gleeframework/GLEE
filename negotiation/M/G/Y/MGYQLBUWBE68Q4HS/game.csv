"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be happy to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree that the product is worth that much. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,4,
