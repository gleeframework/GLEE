Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Time Limit:**  Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept your offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the high price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always lower your price, but you can't raise it once offered."
