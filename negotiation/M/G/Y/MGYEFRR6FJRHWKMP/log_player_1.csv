""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my absolute minimum, I have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob has dropped his offer to my absolute minimum. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely he'll go higher. I can secure my minimum price by selling to John immediately."
