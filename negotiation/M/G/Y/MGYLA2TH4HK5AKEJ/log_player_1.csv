{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves you with a substantial profit.  It allows for potential negotiation and gives you some room to maneuver if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but based on my budget, I am only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent sum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
