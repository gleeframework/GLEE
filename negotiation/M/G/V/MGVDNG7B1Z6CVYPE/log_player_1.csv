Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving space for a potential compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1525000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm worried about potentially getting stuck at a price I'm not entirely happy with. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is significantly above my minimum requirement and guarantees I won't lose money. I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure a secure and satisfactory outcome."
