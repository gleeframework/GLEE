{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the value of the product for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **I'm open to negotiation.** The message doesn't close the door to further discussion, making Bob feel valued and increasing the chances of a deal.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.  
* **If negotiations stall:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low. It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground that's more acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,000? That still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired value but still lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Friendly and encouraging message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, highlighting the benefits for Bob while keeping the door open for further discussion.
* **Focus on shared value:** By mentioning a ""great deal"" for Bob, I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal! 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer considering its current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum desired value than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not convinced by Bob's argument about market value, as I'm confident in the value of the product. 

I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob continues to be unwilling to negotiate further, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm really close to accepting John's offer of $15,000. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a significant discount for you compared to John's offer, and it's a price I can comfortably work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Highlighting John's offer:** By mentioning John's offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price. It emphasizes the potential loss he faces if we can't agree.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Framing it as a ""significant discount"":** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer is intended as a final attempt to reach an agreement. If Bob rejects it, I'll accept John's offer and move on."
