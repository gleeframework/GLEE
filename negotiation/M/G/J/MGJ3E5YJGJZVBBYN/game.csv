"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,000? That still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer considering its current market value.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm really close to accepting John's offer of $15,000. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a significant discount for you compared to John's offer, and it's a price I can comfortably work with.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
