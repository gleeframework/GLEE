Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than your minimum ($10,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your minimum.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message emphasizes value to Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward. While a higher initial offer might scare Bob away, a significantly lower offer risks leaving money on the table."
