"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's price is high:** $925,000 is closer to your maximum budget than it is to Alice's perceived value. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have an alternative:** John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  This serves as a fallback option.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can:

1. **Try to negotiate:**  Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. 
2. **Use John as leverage:** You can let Alice know you have another offer, which could encourage her to be more flexible. 

Let's see if Alice comes down on her price!"
