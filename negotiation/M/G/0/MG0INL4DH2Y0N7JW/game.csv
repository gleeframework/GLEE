"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,000. This is a fair offer given the value you placed on it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
