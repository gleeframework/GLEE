,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
