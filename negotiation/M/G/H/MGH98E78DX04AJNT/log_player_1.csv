"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get more for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum. I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
