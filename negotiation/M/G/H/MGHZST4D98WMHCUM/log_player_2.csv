{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about buying but are also willing to pay significantly less than her asking price. $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still slightly above your maximum budget but significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This gives you room to negotiate further if she rejects."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still significantly above your budget, and you're running out of rounds.

This decision minimizes your risk and ensures you get the product without going over your financial limit."
