Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer, but I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a better price than my initial offer, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still being within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. It's better for me to take the guaranteed $100 from John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
