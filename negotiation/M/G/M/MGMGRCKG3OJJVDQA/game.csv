"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This seems like a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
