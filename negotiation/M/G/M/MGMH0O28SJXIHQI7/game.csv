"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Could you do $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $750,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $625,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a very good offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  To be honest,  $700,000 is pushing it for me, but I'm willing to close the deal today at $650,000 if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not getting the value I want. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.
