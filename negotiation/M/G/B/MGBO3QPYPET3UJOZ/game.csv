"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we try 125? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
