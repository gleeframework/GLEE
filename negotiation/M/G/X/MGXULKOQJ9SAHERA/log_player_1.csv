Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, Alice should aim for a price higher than that with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,190,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $10,000 less than its value to him, and Alice earns $10,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially secure an even better deal."
