"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm flexible and willing to discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little over my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. $7,000 is closer but still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more significant improvement in his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but I need to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  Think about the value this product will bring you, and let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
