"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.  I'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $2,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

*  **Bridging the Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from my initial ask, indicating serious interest. Countering at $2,050,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justifying the Value:** I reiterate the product's inherent value.  This reminds Bob of the potential benefits and justifies the higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By making a substantial counteroffer, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer, but $1,900,000 is still below my minimum. I need to hold firm to maximize my return. I'll counter again, but I need to be aware of the shrinking negotiation space."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a solution.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,975,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my best offer. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider it. 
* **Concession, But Firm:** The small reduction from my previous counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm near my bottom line. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. I need to push for a decision soon or consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this price is more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer, even after my ""final offer,"" shows he's unlikely to meet my minimum price. Further negotiation seems unproductive.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing with Bob risks missing out on John's guaranteed $1,500,000. Time is a factor, and each round carries this risk.
* **Guaranteed Return:** While selling to Bob could potentially yield a higher return, it's not guaranteed. John provides a certain and immediate profit. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
