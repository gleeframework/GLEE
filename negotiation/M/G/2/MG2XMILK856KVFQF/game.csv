"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you a price of $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $10,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll give you a small concession and offer you a price of $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
