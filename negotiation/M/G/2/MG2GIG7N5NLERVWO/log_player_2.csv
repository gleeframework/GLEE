"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's best to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $720,000?"",
""product_price"": 720000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, aiming to provide room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $720,000, I signal a strong desire for a lower price while still leaving space to potentially meet Alice closer to the middle ground. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping in mind that John offers the product for $800,000 helps define my upper limit in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $850,000 is still above John's offer of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting close to the point where buying from John makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $775,000?"",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but not dramatically. The increase from $720,000 to $775,000 signals a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming for a price that's below John's offer ($800,000) while still being a reasonable jump from my previous offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** While I haven't set a firm deadline, I'm aware that every counteroffer prolongs the process. I need to reach a deal soon or go with John's existing offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which is $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $812,500.  While this is closer to my budget, it's still more expensive than John's standing offer of $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the more favorable price."
