"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which is $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",812500.0,Alice,5,,
