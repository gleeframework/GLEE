Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $800,000. I can offer you a price of $825,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but here's why it makes sense to accept now:

* **Alice is firm:** She's stated this is her final offer and has been relatively consistent in her concessions. 
* **Time is running out:**  You're getting close to the end of your 10 rounds, leaving less room to negotiate further.
* **Savings are good:** While not ideal, $825,000 is a $375,000 savings compared to John's offer.

It's unlikely you'll get her below $825,000, and the risk of her walking away and you having to pay John's higher price is too great."
