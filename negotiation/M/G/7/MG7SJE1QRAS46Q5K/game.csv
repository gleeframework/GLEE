"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter.  I'm getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still more than I want to spend.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $900,000 is too far from where I see the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
