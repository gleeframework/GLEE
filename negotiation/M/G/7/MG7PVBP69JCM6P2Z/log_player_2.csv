"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $100. It's worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Let's try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$95 is still a bit too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $92, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting closer to the price I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $99? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $99 is tempting, we're still within our budget and can likely get it for less. Let's keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm  appreciating your flexibility, but $99 is still a little more than I'm aiming for. How about we settle at $94? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
