,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $108, and I think that's fair considering the price I could get it for elsewhere.  Let me know if that works for you.",108.0,Bob,4,
