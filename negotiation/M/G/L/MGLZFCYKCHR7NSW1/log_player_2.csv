Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $880,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $860,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $860,000. It's within your budget and represents a good compromise. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers and you may end up paying more from John. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
