"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). Bob should try to negotiate further to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to considering that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to consider my own minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000.  While this is still above Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000. It's a good compromise and a good deal for Bob."
