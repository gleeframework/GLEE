Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to our respective target prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that more accurately, I propose a price of $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($950,000) and his lowball offer ($700,000).
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to reinforce that my asking price is justified.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?  This price reflects the value I see in the product while acknowledging your need for a fair return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $787,500 is slightly below my ideal price, it's now above my absolute minimum of $800,000. Holding out for a slightly higher price carries the risk of Bob walking away, potentially leaving me with a less favorable deal from John. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
