Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not ideal, getting the product for $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Waiting any longer risks Alice walking away, and we'd be forced to buy from John at our absolute maximum price."
