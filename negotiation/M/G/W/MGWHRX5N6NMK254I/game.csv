"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows us to move forward.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
