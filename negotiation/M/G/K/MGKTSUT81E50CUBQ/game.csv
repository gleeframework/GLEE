"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product, I cannot lower the price below $12,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",12000.0,Alice,3,
