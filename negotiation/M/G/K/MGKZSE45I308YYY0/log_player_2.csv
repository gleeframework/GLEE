Given its unique features and capabilities, I estimate its intrinsic value to be well above $1200000. However, to facilitate a transaction that benefits both parties, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1500000. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and personalized support to ensure seamless integration into your existing systems. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any way I can assist you in making an informed decision.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While the product might be valuable, Bob can secure the same product from John for a lower price.  There's no reason to pay more than necessary."
