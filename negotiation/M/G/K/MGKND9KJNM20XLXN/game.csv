"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
