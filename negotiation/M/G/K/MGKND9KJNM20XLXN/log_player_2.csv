"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further. Accepting this offer saves Bob $400,000 compared to buying from John, and is a good compromise."
