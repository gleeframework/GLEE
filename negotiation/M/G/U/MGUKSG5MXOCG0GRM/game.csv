"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130?",130.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,142.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $137? I think you'll find it's a fair price for a great product.",137.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $135.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,139.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. How about we meet at $138? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get the sale done.",138.0,Alice,5,,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you're eager to sell, but $138.50 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $137, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",137.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,138.0
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $137. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $137 and $138.50, which is $137.75. That's my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.",137.75,Alice,9,,
