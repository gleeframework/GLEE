"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  Bob has a strong position because he has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000. This gives him leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  This offer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. He still has the option of buying from John for $1,500,000, which gives him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000.  He's trying to meet Alice halfway, but he's still holding firm to a price significantly lower than her current offer.  This shows he's serious about buying the product but won't overpay. This counteroffer also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has lowered her price again, $1,250,000 is still a significant amount above Bob's desired price. It's closer to his upper limit, but it's still too high for him to accept at this point. Bob can afford to reject the offer and continue negotiating, keeping in mind that he always has the option to buy from John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still holding firm to a lower price.  This counteroffer shows that he's willing to compromise but is still trying to get the best deal possible.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward and prevents a stalemate."
