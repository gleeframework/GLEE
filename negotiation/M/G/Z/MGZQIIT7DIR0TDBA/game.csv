"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.  I think that's a fair starting point considering its potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $1,150,000 is a little high for me right now. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point.  While I think $1,050,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to make another move to close this deal quickly, but $950,000 is too low.  Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To be frank,  $987,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can go down to $1,012,000, but that's my final offer.",1012000.0,Alice,7,
