"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $200.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the tone for a more aggressive negotiation. He's willing to pay $120, which is still within his budget, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his ideal price. He can continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to save some money. He's offering $140, showing that he's serious about buying the product but is still hoping to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate because Bob can get the same product from John for the same price.  It's best to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation."
