Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're close, Bob, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value it has for me. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Narrowing Gap:**  We've significantly narrowed the negotiation gap. Alice started at $1,100,000 and is now at $1,025,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, and there's a risk Alice becomes less flexible.
* **Savings:** Accepting this offer still saves you $175,000 compared to John's price.

This offer represents a good balance between getting a favorable price and securing the product."
