{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to meet my minimum requirements while giving you a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.
