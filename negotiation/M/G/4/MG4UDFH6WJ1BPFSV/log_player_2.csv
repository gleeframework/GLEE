"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget, so it's worth trying to negotiate further. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob can likely still negotiate a better price, so he should reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a significant discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is just slightly above Bob's last counteroffer of $1,000,000. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  Bob can save $450,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely further negotiation won't result in a significantly better price."
