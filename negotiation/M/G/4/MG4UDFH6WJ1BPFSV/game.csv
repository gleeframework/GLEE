"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a significant discount. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
