"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value for the product. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a substantial amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves a good profit margin for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and still provides a decent profit margin for Alice. Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a good price while avoiding further negotiation."
