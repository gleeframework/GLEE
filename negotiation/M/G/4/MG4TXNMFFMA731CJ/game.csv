,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1600000 for it. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, but I think that's still a bit high. Can you consider going a bit lower?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm thinking $1650000 is a sweet spot. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1600000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1680000 for this product. Can you consider that?",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for $1680000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1680000, which is $1640000. Can you consider that?",1640000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my target, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1640000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. Can you consider $1640000 with these extras?",1640000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1620000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1620000.0,Bob,10,
