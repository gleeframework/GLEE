"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny of $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice since her offer is higher than our $100 fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer ($70 vs. $95). This gives us room for negotiation and signals we're looking for a better deal. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is below Alice's value ($80).  While she might not accept it immediately, it sets a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $70 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Her offer of $85 is closer to her value of $80, but we can likely get it lower.  We'll try a counteroffer between our previous offer and her current one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($85). It's a common negotiation tactic and can signal fairness.
* **Targeting Below Value:** We're aiming slightly below Alice's value of $80. While she might not accept this immediately, it keeps us moving towards a price we're comfortable with.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message continues to be friendly and collaborative, fostering a good negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Tell you what, let's split the difference again and call it $81. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $81 is only $1 more than her value and well below our fallback option of $100. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks alienating Alice and having to buy from John for $100. Accepting now secures a good deal."
