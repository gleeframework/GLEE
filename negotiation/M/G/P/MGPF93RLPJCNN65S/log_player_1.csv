Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
