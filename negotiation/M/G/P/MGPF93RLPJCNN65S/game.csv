"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000.  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good return on your investment while making the product viable for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $900,000 is still not quite there. Let's try $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price and allows me to move closer to my desired value.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $910,000? This price is a fair compromise, closer to your target than my last offer, while allowing me to stay within my budget.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again and aim for $915,000. This brings us closer to an agreement, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
