"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've been developing for some time, and I'm confident that it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a substantial discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential of this product.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
