"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **High but Realistic:**  $1,500,000 is a significant amount of money, but it's not outlandishly high. I want to gauge Bob's interest while leaving myself some wiggle room. 
* **First Impression:**  A strong opening offer sets the tone for the negotiation and shows Bob I'm confident in the value of my product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer to see if he's interested and how strongly he wants to buy the product.
* **Prepare Counteroffers:** Based on Bob's response, I will be ready with a few counteroffers to either further increase the price or start negotiating down, depending on the situation.
* **Monitor Time:** I will keep track of the rounds, but I won't be afraid to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing quickly or favorably."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to negotiate further and potentially reach a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he is interested in the product. This gives me confidence that I can push for a higher price with subsequent counteroffers.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to continue the negotiation.  It's too early to settle for a price below my initial goal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price, perhaps around $1,400,000. This will show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price but also willing to compromise.
* **Observe Bob's Reactions:** I will closely observe Bob's responses to my counteroffers to gauge his level of interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential Switch to John:** While I'm hopeful of closing the deal with Bob, I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations stall or fall too far below my target price."

* **Building on Interest:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he values the product, so I'm raising the price slightly but not to a point that feels unreasonable.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I am aiming for a price closer to my initial goal, but I am still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  His response will help me determine the next move.
* **Strategic Counteroffers:**  I'll have counteroffers prepared in advance, both higher and lower, depending on Bob's stance.
