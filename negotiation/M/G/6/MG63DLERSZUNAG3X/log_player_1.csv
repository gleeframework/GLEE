{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground, offering a price that is higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation space without risking losing the deal outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $85 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is slightly below my minimum desired price, it's still a better deal than selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer will allow me to secure a sale and make a profit."
