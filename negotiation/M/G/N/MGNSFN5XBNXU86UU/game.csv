"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I can get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply won't cover my costs. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
