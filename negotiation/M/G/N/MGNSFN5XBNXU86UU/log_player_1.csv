{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to create a positive starting point for the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.  If I feel the negotiations aren't progressing favorably, I'll switch to John, ensuring I get my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better price.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can achieve a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000), signaling flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly increasing the pressure for him to consider a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hopeful Bob will accept my counter-offer, but I'm prepared to make further adjustments based on his response.  If negotiations stall, I'll ultimately fall back on John to guarantee my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

I'm going to reject his offer and make a final counter-offer. I'll aim to find a compromise that's both profitable for me and appealing to Bob. If he continues to reject offers, I'll move on to John to secure the $1,200,000 sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply won't cover my costs. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating pressure for Bob to accept.  
* **Compromise:** I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but not sacrificing too much.
* **Emphasis on Deal:** I'm focusing on the deal itself, highlighting the benefits for Bob of acquiring the product. 

**Next Steps:**

This is my last attempt to get a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 sale."
