"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $10,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above your ideal price point. You have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $8,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus for you, like a free maintenance package? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still within your budget, and the added bonus of a free maintenance package makes it a more attractive deal.  You're getting a product you want for a good price with a bonus, so it's a good value."
