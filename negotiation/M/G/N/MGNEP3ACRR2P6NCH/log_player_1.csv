Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at the price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While we know John will pay $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Understand Bob's value:** We know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  Offering it significantly higher than that creates a perceived ""deal"" and makes it less likely he'll walk away.
* **Time value of money:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved in dealing with John, even if it means slightly less profit.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a quick sale at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value."
