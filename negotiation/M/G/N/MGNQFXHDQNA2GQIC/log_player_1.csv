Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I am still unable to go beyond $10,000. It seems we are not able to reach an agreement. I will now consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been very clear that his absolute maximum price is $10,000.  He's reiterated this several times and is now even threatening to go to John (although we know John will also only pay $10,000).  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better price and risks losing the guaranteed sale to John."
