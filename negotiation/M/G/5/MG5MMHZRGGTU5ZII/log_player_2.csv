(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to Alice's minimum value while still leaving some room for further negotiation.  $750,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, and still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further.  It's better to risk losing the deal than to pay a price that is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be more aggressive in this round. He knows that Alice is unlikely to accept the previous offer of $750,000.  This counteroffer of $825,000 is closer to Alice's previous offer and may be more appealing, while still being a significant discount from the current offer of $950,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price.  While the difference is smaller, it's still worth pushing for a lower price.  Bob can still potentially save money by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, and it could be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now very close to her last offer, and it's getting closer to the price Bob is willing to pay from John. While further negotiation could lead to a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become inflexible. At this point, it's more strategic to go with John's offer.  It's a guaranteed price, and although it's not the lowest possible price, it's still significantly better than Alice's current offer."
