"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum offer for the product is $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer. Taking the sure $12,000 is the best choice."
