Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $8,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. This strategy aims to get a price close to the product's worth to Bob while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my minimum price that accepting it is the best option. Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away completely."
