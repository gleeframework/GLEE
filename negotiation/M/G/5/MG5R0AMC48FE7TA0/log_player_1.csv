"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Based on its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as we risk him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether. Accepting John's offer ensures we receive the product's minimum value to us."
