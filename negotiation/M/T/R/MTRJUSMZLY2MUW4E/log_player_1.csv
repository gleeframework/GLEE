Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it, $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a sale, $12,500 is too far below my minimum. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's still a great price for a valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I'm going to try and get a bit higher in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting close to running out of rounds. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. I'd rather sell it to him and avoid any further haggling."
