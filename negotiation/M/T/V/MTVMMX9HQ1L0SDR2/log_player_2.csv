"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
 You can get the product for less than $14,000 from Alice, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is now offering the product for $13,000, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer."
