"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are looking to get the product for under $80, and Alice's offer is way above that.  It's best to try and negotiate with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $107.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for us to both be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below what I need.  Let's try $100. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your target price, you can still try to negotiate further. You're close to your goal of under $80, and with more rounds, you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still stuck at $90. It's the most I can afford right now, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your limit.  You've already had several rounds of negotiations and it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to $80. You are running out of rounds, so it's time to secure the product from John for the guaranteed price of $80."
