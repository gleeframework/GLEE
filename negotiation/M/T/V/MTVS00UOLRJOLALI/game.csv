"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $107.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for us to both be happy with the sale.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below what I need.  Let's try $100. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still stuck at $90. It's the most I can afford right now, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,7,
