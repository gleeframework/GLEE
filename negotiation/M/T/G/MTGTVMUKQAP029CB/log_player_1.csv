Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible deal. This also gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Acknowledging Bob's Value:** I'm mentioning the product's worth to Bob to highlight the potential value he'll be getting.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $900,000, I allow space for Bob to make a counteroffer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which serves as a safety net and a negotiating point.

I'm confident that this offer will initiate a productive conversation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a possibility, which gives me leverage in negotiations.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more. Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This price acknowledges the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price, aiming for a compromise.
* **Compromise:** $850,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and open, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

I believe this counteroffer is a fair and reasonable step towards reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $750,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below the minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which means there's room for a better offer. 
* **John as a safe haven:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range and still acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** $800,000 is my absolute bottom line. It's a good price considering the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" suggesting a mutual benefit.
* **Urgency Implied:**  I'm mentioning that I need this price to make the deal work, implying that I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Clear Signal:**  This counteroffer sends a clear signal that I'm serious about selling but won't accept a price that's too low.

I believe this offer is a strong compromise and will lead to a successful negotiation."
