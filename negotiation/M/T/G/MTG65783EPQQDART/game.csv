"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
