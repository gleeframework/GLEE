"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, creating a good starting point for the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob. 

**Remember:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I need to be careful not to push Bob away with an unreasonable price. But, I also want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate a better price. I believe I can achieve a more favorable outcome by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $14,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This reflects the value I know you'll find in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $16,000 is halfway between Bob's offer of $14,000 and my initial offer of $18,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to keep Bob motivated to reach an agreement.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

By gradually lowering my price, I'm hoping to reach a point where Bob is willing to accept.  I have 8 rounds left, so I still have room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:**  While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can do better.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John for $12,000 would be the safe option, but I still have 7 rounds to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Continuing negotiations:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher with a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to my goal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in round 5 that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer of $13,500 and my previous offer of $16,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to remind Bob of the potential benefits of acquiring it.
* **Fair compromise:** I'm positioning my counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us, promoting a sense of mutual benefit.

**Strategy:**

By making a slight concession and emphasizing a fair compromise, I aim to encourage Bob to accept my offer in this round. However, if he rejects, I have 6 rounds left and will need to be more strategic in my next counteroffer."
