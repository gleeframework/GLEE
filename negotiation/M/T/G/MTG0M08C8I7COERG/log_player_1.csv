Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start negotiations high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""significant returns,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to your asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale price. This allows for potential counter-offers while ensuring you remain profitable. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act."
