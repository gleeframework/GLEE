"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I can do $13,500, but that's the best I can offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair compromise and closer to my desired price.  Let's try to close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,6,
