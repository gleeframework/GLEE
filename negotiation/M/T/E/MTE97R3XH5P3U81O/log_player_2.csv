"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my true maximum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but makes it clear I'm looking for a substantial price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $85? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice's offer of $85 is very close to my maximum, but I can still try to negotiate a little further. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's a good chance we can meet in the middle between her current offer ($85) and my last counteroffer ($60)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $72? That seems like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 72
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise by meeting directly in the middle of our last two offers ($85 and $60). 
* **Psychological advantage:** Suggesting a ""fair compromise"" can make the offer more appealing and increase the chances of Alice accepting.
* **Still below my maximum:**  Importantly, the offer remains below my $80 limit, ensuring I get a good deal if Alice agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $72 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached my limit:** Alice's offer of $80 matches my absolute maximum price. 
* **No point in haggling further:**  Trying to negotiate a lower price is unlikely to be successful and could risk losing the deal.
* **Matches John's price:** Accepting this offer means I get the product for the same price I'd pay with John, but with the potential benefit of having built a relationship with Alice for future deals."
