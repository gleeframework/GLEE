"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested at this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $85? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $72? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $72 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $72 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
