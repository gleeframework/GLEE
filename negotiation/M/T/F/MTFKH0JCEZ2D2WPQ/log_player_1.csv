Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** $175 is still below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** $125 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Stronger position:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Positive and open:** My message remains positive and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is acceptable:** $100 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  I doubt I can get Bob to go higher, and I risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** Even if I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $150, so there's no immediate risk. 

Since Bob has reached my minimum acceptable price, accepting his offer is the best course of action to secure a sale and avoid further negotiations."
