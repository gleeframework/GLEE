Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the value I expect to get from the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'd like to propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I expect to get from the product, and it's still within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a deal that leaves me feeling like I've left money on the table. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Even though we're getting closer with Bob, we're running out of time, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my minimum price. It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
