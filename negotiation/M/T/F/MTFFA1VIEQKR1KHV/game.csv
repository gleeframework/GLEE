"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could you do $9,000?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",9000.0,Bob,4,
