"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's still a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's high enough to be enticing to Bob, but also low enough to make him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it reflects the product's value.  I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm confident that I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $10,500. This is a small increase from my last offer, and I believe it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I am not going to settle for much less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm going to reject it. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is a significant safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

I'm going to make a slight concession and lower my offer to $10,200. I'm still above Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping that this shows him my commitment to reaching a deal. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I want to make a final effort to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. His offers are still too low, and we are nearing the end of our rounds. I'm confident that I can get my minimum value by selling to John."
