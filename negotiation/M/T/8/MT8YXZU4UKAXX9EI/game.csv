"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000.

"Bob, I think we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $11,250, but I need to get at least $12,000. I'm willing to give you a 5% discount, so I'll meet you at $11,250. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a free warranty and maintenance package, to sweeten the deal. I'll meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
