"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I can't afford $9,500. My budget allows me to spend up to $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering the value of the product and my budget, and I'd like to propose $8,500. This would allow us to stay within my financial limits while still being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds. There's a good chance I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $8,625? It's a small increase from your last offer, but still gives you a great deal, and gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8625} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've thought about it carefully, and I'd like to counter with $8,600. This keeps us moving forward in our negotiations while respecting both of our financial positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in the second half of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $8,600 is only $25 less than my previous offer.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get much higher."
