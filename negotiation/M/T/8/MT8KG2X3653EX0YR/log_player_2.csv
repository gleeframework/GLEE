"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. I want to try to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its potential benefits. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still undervalued at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also acknowledging your concerns about the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.  While I still want to save as much as possible, this offer is getting closer to my target and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer saves me $350,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option at this point."
