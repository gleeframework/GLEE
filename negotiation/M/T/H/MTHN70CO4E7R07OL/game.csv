"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
