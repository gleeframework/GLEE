"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for this valuable product.  Let's try to find some middle ground.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $125 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - $137.50 would be a fair compromise.  It's a good price for you, and still allows me to make a decent profit.",137.5,Alice,5,
