Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $11,000.  This is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it gives me room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see if I can push for a better price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my goal. I have a backup buyer in John, so I don't have to settle for a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to what I want, and it shows him I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum price of $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. While I was hoping for a better price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John."
