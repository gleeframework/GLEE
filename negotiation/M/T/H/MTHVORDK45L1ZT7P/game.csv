Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a one-time compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $12500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product's value is worth a bit more. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $12000. I'm starting to think that I might need to consider buying from John for $12000. I'd like to make one final offer of $12000, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
