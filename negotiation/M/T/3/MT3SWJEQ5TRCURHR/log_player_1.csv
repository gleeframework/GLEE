Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go all the way to $175. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just isn't going to work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. How about we try $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John. Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's better to lock in a sale for $150 with John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
