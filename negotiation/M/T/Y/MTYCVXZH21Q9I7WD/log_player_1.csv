"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm countering with $13,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's initial offer and my desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I still have a few rounds left and believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm countering with $12,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
