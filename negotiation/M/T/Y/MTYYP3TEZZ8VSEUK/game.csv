"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that price point be workable?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $600,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this negotiation is definitely getting us closer to a deal! How about we settle at $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",675000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,7,
