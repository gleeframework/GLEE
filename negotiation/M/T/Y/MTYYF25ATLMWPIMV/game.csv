"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, $700,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $875,000. This offer reflects a considerable discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a great deal on a product I know will benefit you greatly.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This price reflects my maximum willingness to pay, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
