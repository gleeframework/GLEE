"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $1,100,000 is already a competitive offer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. While I'm committed to making this deal happen, the  $975,000 offer is still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,012,500.  This reflects my strong desire to work with you while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
