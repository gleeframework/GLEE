"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You've set a clear floor of $8,000, and $12,000 is well above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so you've given him space to bargain.
* **It demonstrates your confidence:**  By starting high, you show that you believe in the product's value. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he's willing to pay closer to $15,000, you can adjust your price accordingly.  However, be ready to walk away if Bob is not willing to meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what you believe the product is worth. You've already established your value, and Bob has acknowledged it by offering closer to your initial price. This means there is room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round. You can leverage the fact that Bob is willing to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my absolute minimum.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You are showing flexibility by lowering your price from $12,000 to $10,500.
* **Maintain Value:** You are still emphasizing the product's worth, reminding Bob of its value beyond his initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By offering $10,500, you are leaving room for Bob to potentially counter with a higher price, potentially closer to your desired outcome.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still maintaining your negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to your desired price, and $9,750 is a significant improvement over his initial offer of $9,000. It's also closer to your own minimum than your last counteroffer. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a deal that's more favorable than selling to John, and you don't risk losing any more time by continuing the negotiation. While you might have been able to squeeze out a bit more, it's important to recognize that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away completely. 

This decision is a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a deal is made within the allotted rounds."
