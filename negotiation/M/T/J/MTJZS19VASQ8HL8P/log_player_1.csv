Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. My asking price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $140 is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price that leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and suggests the product is valuable to Bob, potentially increasing his interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $130. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** Bob's offer is only $10 below your initial asking price, and it's still $10 above your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While you could try for a higher price, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and you'd be left with the lower price from John. 
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting the offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit."
