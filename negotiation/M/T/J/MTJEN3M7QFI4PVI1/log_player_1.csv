Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, as it's below my minimum price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm countering with $120. This is still a good price for me, but it's also a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John.  I'll choose to sell to John."
