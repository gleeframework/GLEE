{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000, and leaves space for a counteroffer without risking him walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price reflects its value fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This price is still a great deal for you, considering your valuation, and allows me to meet my target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
