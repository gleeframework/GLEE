"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers, potentially getting a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  A $500 reduction from Alice's price is a good starting point. It shows you're serious about buying, but also that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Keep the message friendly:**  Maintain a positive tone and emphasize your interest in the product.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  You have 8 rounds remaining, so there's still room to haggle if Alice rejects your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but I'm confident in the product's value at a slightly higher price point.  Would you consider $9,300? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're trying to get the price down to $9,000, and $9,300 is still above your target.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  It's better to keep trying to lower the price than to accept an offer that's not ideal. 
* **John remains a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice completely break down, you can still buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,300 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,150.  I believe this is a fair price that respects both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 9150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By offering a price in the middle of your last offer and Alice's, you demonstrate a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a respectful tone:** Continue to communicate politely and professionally.
* **Leave room for a final adjustment:** While you're closer to your target price, there's still some wiggle room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
