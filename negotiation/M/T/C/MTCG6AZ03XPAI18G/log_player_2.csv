"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. However, I've always believed in fostering strong business relationships, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted rate of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget. Buying from John saves you $150,000."
