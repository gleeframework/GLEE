Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. However, I've always believed in fostering strong business relationships, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted rate of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By starting at $950,000, you create room for negotiation while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances securing a sale with the potential for earning the highest possible amount from Bob."
