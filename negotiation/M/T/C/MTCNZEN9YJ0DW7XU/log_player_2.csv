"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly above her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's important to signal that I'm serious about buying but also looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth more.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high. It's clear she's willing to negotiate, so I'll continue to push for a lower price.  There's still a decent margin between her offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last two offers, signaling a willingness to compromise but also firmness on the budget. By stating it's the highest I can go, I'm adding a sense of urgency and hopefully encouraging Alice to accept."
