"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $110, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
