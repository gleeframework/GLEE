"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her product's worth to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your valuation and my own needs.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to push for a lower price.  The goal is to secure the product for as close to $800,000 as possible, which is Alice's valuation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price point, which is likely somewhere near Alice's valuation of $800,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might be unwilling to go lower, leaving Bob with the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
