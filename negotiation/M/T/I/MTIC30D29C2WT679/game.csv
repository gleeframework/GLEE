"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9500? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
