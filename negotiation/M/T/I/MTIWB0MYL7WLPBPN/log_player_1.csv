Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. I believe this price reflects its value and allows you a significant profit margin.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This would be a more comfortable price for me, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to make a counter-offer closer to my desired price point.  Selling to John at $800,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a larger profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking $950,000 is a fair price. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to sell for more,  the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling through entirely is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent profit and minimizes the risk."
