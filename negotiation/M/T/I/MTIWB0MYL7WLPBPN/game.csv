"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. I believe this price reflects its value and allows you a significant profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This would be a more comfortable price for me, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking $950,000 is a fair price. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,,
