"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer helps us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to increase our offer gradually and still stay well below our $120 limit.
* **Potentially secure a great deal:** There's a chance Alice might accept this offer, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to get a better deal. Splitting the difference again would put us at $77.50, but let's see if we can push a little lower before going that high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit optimistic.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're getting closer!  This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  Moving closer to Alice's price demonstrates that we're serious about reaching a deal.
* **Targets a fair price:** $80 seems like a reasonable compromise, potentially leaving both parties satisfied.
* **Maintains a buffer:** We're still comfortably below our $120 limit, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
