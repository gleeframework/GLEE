Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, so I cannot accept an offer below that. I will try to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $85. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'll try to get closer to $80 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to try for a few more rounds to see if we can reach $80, the risk of continuing is too high. If Bob continues to refuse, I might end up with nothing.  

Selling to John guarantees me $80, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is the safest option for me at this point."
