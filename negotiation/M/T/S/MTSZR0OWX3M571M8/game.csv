"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",78.0,Bob,6,
