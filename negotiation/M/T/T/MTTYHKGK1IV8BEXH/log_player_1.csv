"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, and I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of its unique qualities and the value it brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This offer reflects my best effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,120,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose a price of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $1,080,000 is appealing, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

This round, we've made a smaller concession and presented it as our ""final offer"" to add a bit of pressure and hopefully bring the negotiation to a close soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll propose $1,090,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has countered with a price very close to our target and marked it as his final offer. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from him at this point. Accepting this offer secures us a good profit."
