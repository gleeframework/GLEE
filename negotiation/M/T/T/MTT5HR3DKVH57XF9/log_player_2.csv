"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant drop from its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still above your desired maximum. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate, as Alice is clearly willing to come down from her initial asking price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $987,500 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $1,010,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While Alice is clearly trying to be flexible, $1,010,000 is still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  The fact that Alice is making concessions and acknowledging the need for a compromise suggests there's more room for negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:** It's important to remember you have John as a backup option, so you're not under pressure to accept a price that's too high. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to push for a lower price in the next round."
