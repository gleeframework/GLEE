Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still represent a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair price considering my budget.
