It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer of $12,000. You've consistently aimed for a price closer to $11,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. Taking the sure thing with John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
