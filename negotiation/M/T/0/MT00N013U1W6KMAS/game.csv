"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  This is my maximum offer, as I can buy the same product from John for that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1100000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth it for both of us. Let's shake on it!",1075000.0,Alice,5,
