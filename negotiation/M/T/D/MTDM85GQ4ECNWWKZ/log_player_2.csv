"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is a move in the right direction, it's still above Bob's desired price. There's still potential to negotiate further. Bob should aim for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $925,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's worth. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum. It's worth continuing the negotiation with the aim of getting the price closer to $875,000.  If there's no movement in the next round, Bob may need to consider purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000. This is a reasonable price that's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $895,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $885,000, Alice's offer of $895,000 is very close.  Considering that the deal could fall apart and Bob would have to buy from John for $1,200,000, it's worth accepting Alice's offer to avoid that risk.  There's a significant saving compared to John's price, and Bob still gets a good deal."
