"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,250 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
