Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but still above my minimum acceptable value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $125 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can likely do better. I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It's a nice product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and  closer to my desired price of $125. I will accept his offer."
