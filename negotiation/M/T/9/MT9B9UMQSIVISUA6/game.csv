"I'm interested in the product, but I think $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $11000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. It's a fair price, considering what the product is worth to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $11800. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11800.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
