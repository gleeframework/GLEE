"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1000000 and I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs.  Let's start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $1050000? This gives us both some room to work with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $1050000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $950000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $950000 is a good offer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
