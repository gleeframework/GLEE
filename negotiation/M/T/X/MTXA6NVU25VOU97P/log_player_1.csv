Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone helps establish a good rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential mutually beneficial outcome.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing that I can still sell to John for $8,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a higher price and try to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I'm happy to work with you but $8,500 is a bit lower than what I can accept. How about we split the difference at $9,000?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Clear price:** I've provided a specific price to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Staying above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum threshold, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting his offer, I could still try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the future if I have a good relationship with Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale that's almost at my minimum threshold, while still keeping the door open for potentially better deals in the future."
