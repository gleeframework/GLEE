,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10000?  This is my best offer, and I'm willing to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
