"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12,500? That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to meet you closer to the middle. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
