Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my minimum. I'll counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to him for $12,000 is a good outcome and avoids any further negotiation."
