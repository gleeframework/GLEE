"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  My initial offer is $17,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can likely negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as there's room to save money with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This gives us both some room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it is closer to his desired price, it is still higher than what he is willing to pay. He can continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further. Buying from John at this point would not save him any money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $15,500?  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 15500}
