Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $19,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000, Alice has a safety net. This allows her to aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a profit significantly above her minimum. 
* **Create a Sense of Value and Urgency:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the offer as time-sensitive, Alice aims to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, Alice still gets her minimum acceptable price from John."
