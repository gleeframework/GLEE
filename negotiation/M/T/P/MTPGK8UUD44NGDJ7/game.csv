"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
