Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the waters:**  The $18,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This helps you gauge his interest and potential to pay a premium. 
* **Justification for the price:** While not explicitly stated in the message, you can be prepared to justify the price based on the product's unique qualities or your unwillingness to sell it for less.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob to be price-sensitive, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You can gradually lower the price, but remember your bottom line is $10,000."
