Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $100 is lower than what Bob values the product at ($120), leaving room for potential negotiation and a win-win scenario. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that maximizes your profit while giving Bob a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80, and it's closer to your initial offer of $100. It's a good compromise that allows you to secure a reasonable profit without risking further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
