Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to remember that Bob's value of the product is unknown, so I want to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving space for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves a decent margin above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to consider while still remaining profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and selling to John would only net me $100,000 more.  It's worth accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations."
