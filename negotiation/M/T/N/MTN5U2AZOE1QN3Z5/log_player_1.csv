Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $15,000 to guarantee a sale, there's room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation might make him feel like he's getting a deal and encourage him to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $12,000 but lower than $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects our offer, we have John as a backup who's willing to pay our desired price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
