Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,999.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if you can get a price closer to your product's true value from Bob. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring you get at least $15,000 if he declines.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer without overthinking it."
