Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still go higher if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **It's potentially attractive to Bob:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $15,000. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum.  You can likely get more by counteroffering.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** It meets Bob halfway by splitting the difference between your last offer and his offer.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're holding firm on your minimum price of $10,000.
* **It shows you're serious about the deal:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining your own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. That's still a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is a bit closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. At this point, Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further.  To ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation, selling to John for $10,000 is the most sensible option. You are guaranteed a sale at your minimum price, and you can move on to other opportunities."
