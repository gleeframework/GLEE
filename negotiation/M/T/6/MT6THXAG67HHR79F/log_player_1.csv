Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that I'm open to discussing the price, showing flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good profit!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000, ensuring a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Profit:** I'm aiming for a profit closer to $14,000, and Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my desired threshold.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Even if he rejects my counteroffer, I can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Building Momentum:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to stand my ground. It can potentially encourage him to raise his offer in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial target.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to justify my price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation positive and open to agreement.

**Next Steps:**
