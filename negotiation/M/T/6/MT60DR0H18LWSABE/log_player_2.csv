"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for a better price than Alice's offer, as it's worth $1,200,000 to her.  
* It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to her value. 
* Buying from John is a last resort, so we'll hold off on that for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value. 
* This aggressive move might make Alice more willing to negotiate.
* We're still within our budget, leaving room for potential concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to a price that's very close to our ideal value, and it's well within our budget.
* There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Alice becoming less willing to sell.
* At this point, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
