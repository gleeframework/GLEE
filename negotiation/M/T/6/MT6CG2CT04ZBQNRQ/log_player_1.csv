Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that is pointless. He's likely willing to go somewhat above his valuation for a worthwhile product.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $1,400,000  leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling around $1,300,000 - $1,350,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time"" aspect adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly and favorably.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale above Bob's valuation while leaving myself room to negotiate and still earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price."
