"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. Given its high value and quality, this is an excellent opportunity for you to secure it at a competitive price. I believe you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $115.
* You can get it from John for $120. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. Even though you'll pay the maximum you're willing to, it's still cheaper than Alice's offer."
