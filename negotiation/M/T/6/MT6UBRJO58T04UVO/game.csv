"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $8500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we aim for $9000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about we meet at $9200? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
