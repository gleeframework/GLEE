"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $7,500. Let me know if that works for you!",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000. I'm willing to come down to $7,250, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you!",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,100. Let's make a deal!",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,100, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about we try $7,300? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!",7300.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there!  I'm willing to split the difference. How about $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,200. I'm willing to come down to $7,250, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time!",7250.0,Alice,9,
