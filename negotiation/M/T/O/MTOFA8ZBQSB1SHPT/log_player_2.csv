"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details.  If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice or potentially find another seller."
