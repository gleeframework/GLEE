"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value your business, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
