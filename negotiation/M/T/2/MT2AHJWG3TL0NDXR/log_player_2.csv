"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better. You have 10 rounds and a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking for a price closer to $900,000. This would give us both a fair deal and allow for a mutually beneficial outcome. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a price of at least $1050000 to make it worth my while. I believe this is a fair compromise and would be a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,050,000 is still higher than your ideal. You want to save as much money as possible and still have room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,000,000 feels like a more reasonable price that reflects the value for both of us. I'm confident this price would work for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this figure. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and my original offer of $1100000. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has offered $1,050,000, which is closer to your ideal price of $900,000. While it's still higher, you have limited time and rounds left.  You have already countered twice with no success. You can potentially continue negotiating, but there is a chance that Alice will become less flexible or you may even reach a stalemate.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
