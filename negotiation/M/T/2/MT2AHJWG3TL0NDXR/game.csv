"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking for a price closer to $900000. This would give us both a fair deal and allow for a mutually beneficial outcome. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a price of at least $1050000 to make it worth my while. I believe this is a fair compromise and would be a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1000000 feels like a more reasonable price that reflects the value for both of us. I'm confident this price would work for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this figure. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and my original offer of $1100000. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
