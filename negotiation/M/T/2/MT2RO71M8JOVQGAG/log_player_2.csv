"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum value as possible. Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price.  While John offers a guaranteed purchase, Bob is hoping to save even more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $108 is still within his budget, and he hopes this offer will be more appealing to Alice while still being significantly lower than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value, and he's not willing to go above $110 yet.  While the time is getting tighter, Bob is determined to save as much as possible.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if they can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer once more, demonstrating flexibility. At $110, he is now at his maximum value. He is hoping that Alice will accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely buy the product from John to avoid losing the opportunity altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. There's only a small window left to negotiate, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that they will reach an agreement.  Given the limited time and the risk of losing the product altogether, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $120, as it is still within his budget, and he can guarantee the purchase."
