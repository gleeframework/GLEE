"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I'm confident this product is worth it, and I'm willing to be flexible for a quick sale.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $7500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8000. It's a fair price for a product that is worth it. I'm ready to close the deal now, but I can't go lower than that.",8000.0,Alice,5,
