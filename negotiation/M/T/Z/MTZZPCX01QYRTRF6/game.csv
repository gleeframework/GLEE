"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, my budget is limited to $800000 for this purchase. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1200000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1200000 is slightly out of my budget. Could you possibly lower the price further? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to be mindful of the product's value.

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1150000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
