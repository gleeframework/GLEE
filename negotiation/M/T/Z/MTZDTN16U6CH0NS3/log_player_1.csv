"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's showing interest, $90 is still too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $100.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I need. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'm also running out of time and don't want to risk selling to John for less than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this work, but $85 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I'd hoped for, it's getting close to my minimum. I'm worried about losing the deal and having to sell to John for less.  I'm also running out of time, so it's better to take this offer rather than risk getting nothing."
