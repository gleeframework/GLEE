Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $14,500 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting that you have another buyer (without explicitly mentioning the price) subtly creates a sense of urgency and value.

This approach aims for a win-win situation where Bob might perceive he's getting a slight discount, while you secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value."
