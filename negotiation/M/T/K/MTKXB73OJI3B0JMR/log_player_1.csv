Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a good starting point.** It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.**  This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than immediately reject the deal. 

By starting with a higher price, I aim to maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then use his counter-offer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counter-offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and appreciate your offer.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($120) and his offer ($100). 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate my justification for a higher price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer again if needed. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still keeping my profit margin higher than the $80 offered by John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to consider $105? I think that's a good compromise between our initial offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:** $105 is very close to my desired price range and significantly better than selling to John for $80.
* **Limited bargaining power:** Bob has shown a firm stance at $105. Further negotiation might risk him walking away altogether.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might prolong the process and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a better offer from another buyer. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal or getting a lower price."
