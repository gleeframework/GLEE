Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $130.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We start with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80) but below Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leave Bob Feeling Good:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, the price is still a good deal compared to his perceived value, making him more likely to accept.  
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so you won't be left empty-handed if Bob rejects the offer."
