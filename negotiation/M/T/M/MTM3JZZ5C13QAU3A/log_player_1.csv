Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  I'm confident you'll see its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $13,500? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $16,000? This is a significant reduction from my original asking price and reflects my eagerness to do business with you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $16,000 is getting closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $14,000? That would work for me and be a fair compromise I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go substantially higher than $14,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
