"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this price reflects the value I place on it and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential returns.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product, and I truly believe this is a deal we can both be happy with. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
