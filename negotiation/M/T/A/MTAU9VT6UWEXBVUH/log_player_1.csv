Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This offer is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he is getting a good deal.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's a good chance he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  There's a good chance you can get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between your initial offer and his counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still getting a price closer to your goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is getting closer to your desired price.  While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John doesn't outweigh the potential gain.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a good deal."
