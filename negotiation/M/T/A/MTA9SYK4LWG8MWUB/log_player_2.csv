"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have no information on the value of the product to Alice, and her offer is your maximum budget.  There's no reason to negotiate further. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price, eliminating any risk of a prolonged negotiation or a worse outcome."
