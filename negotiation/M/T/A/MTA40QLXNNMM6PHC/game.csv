"Bob, I understand your position. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000 as a final offer, but I can't go any lower. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for me. If you're not interested, I'll need to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
