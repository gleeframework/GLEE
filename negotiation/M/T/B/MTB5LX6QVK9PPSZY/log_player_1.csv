"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's my minimum value, I'm hoping to get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125 as my counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a profit now than to potentially end up selling to John for less."
