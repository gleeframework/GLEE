"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
