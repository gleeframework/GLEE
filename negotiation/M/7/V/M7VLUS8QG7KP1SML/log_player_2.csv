"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $10,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's value, before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $11,250 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and Alice's valuation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $11,050. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,050 is still higher than Bob's ideal price and Alice's valuation. However, it's lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's a relatively small concession from Alice's previous offer.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and save $950 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation may not result in a significantly better price, and risking losing the deal to John is not worth it for a potential small saving."
