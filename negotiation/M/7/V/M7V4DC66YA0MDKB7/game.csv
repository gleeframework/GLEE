"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's definitely a cool product. However,  $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $155.",155.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $165 is closer, but still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  It's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $160 just yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $162. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price.",162.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $162 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. Let's meet in the middle at $161. It's a small difference, but it's the best I can do right now. ",161.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $161. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $163. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",163.0,Alice,7,
