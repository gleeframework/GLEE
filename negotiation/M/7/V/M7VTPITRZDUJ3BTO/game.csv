"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
