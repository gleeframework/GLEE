"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what it's worth to me and more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to counteroffer at $105 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's still less than what it's worth to me. Let's meet halfway!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to go down to $107 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us both.",107.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
