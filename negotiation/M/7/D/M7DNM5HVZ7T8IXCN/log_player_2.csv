Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $1,030,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,030,000, so how about we discuss a price of $1,055,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating in good faith, but she's also holding firm on getting a price above her value for the product. At $1,055,000, we're getting a reasonable deal and further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good price now than risk the deal falling apart."
