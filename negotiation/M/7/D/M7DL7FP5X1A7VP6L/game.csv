"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can see you're willing to pay a bit more than $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000, which is $12,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",12250.0,Alice,5,
