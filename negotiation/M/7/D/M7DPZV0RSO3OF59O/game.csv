"I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a very competitive price for this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
