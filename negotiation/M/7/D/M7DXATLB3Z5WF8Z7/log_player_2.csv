Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to accept $700,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $725,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus package worth $10,000 to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:** She has stated this is her final offer twice and included a bonus to try and close the deal. 
* **The price difference is getting smaller:**  While saving money is important, the difference between your last offer ($700,000) and hers ($725,000) is now relatively small compared to the overall price. 
* **Time is a factor:** You have fewer rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate, especially since Alice seems firm. 

This offer gets you a decent discount from the original price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
