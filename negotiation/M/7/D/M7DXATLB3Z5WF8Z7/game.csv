"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",750000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's some room for negotiation. How about $675,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own needs.",725000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $725,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within a reasonable range for my investment.",700000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to accept $700,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $725,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus package worth $10,000 to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer.",725000.0,Alice,7,,10000.0
