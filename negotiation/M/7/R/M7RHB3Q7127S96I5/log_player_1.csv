Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, there's a risk of Bob finding it unreasonable and immediately rejecting the offer. A slightly lower starting point might make him more receptive."
