"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable at this price, and I'm eager to see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80 for the product. Would you be willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get a little closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
