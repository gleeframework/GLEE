"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15000 to you and I'm ready to purchase it right now. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
