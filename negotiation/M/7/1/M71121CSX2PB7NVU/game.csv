"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good price for the value you'll be getting.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
