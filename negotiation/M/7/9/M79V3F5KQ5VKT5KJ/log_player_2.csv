**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000. 
* **It's not relevant that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.**  Your goal is to get the best deal for yourself.  Alice's valuation of the product is not a factor in your decision."
