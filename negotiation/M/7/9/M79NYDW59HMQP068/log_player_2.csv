You're better off rejecting Alice's offer. You're willing to spend $1,200,000 on this product. This means you have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's likely you can get a better price by making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000 which is within your budget.  It's a good deal considering you are willing to pay $1,200,000 from John. There is no guarantee you can get a better price in further negotiation. You should accept this offer."
