Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing we have a guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price needs to be appealing to Bob, exceeding his $12,000 valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to secure a sale above Bob's perceived value while still leaving us with a comfortable profit margin above John's offer."
