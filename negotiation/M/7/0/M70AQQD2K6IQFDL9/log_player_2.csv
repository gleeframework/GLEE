"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. Even if you can only get Alice down to $850,000, you'll save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
