Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant profit, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  Bob's counteroffer is still well above my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll counteroffer and try to squeeze out a higher price."

This price ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle at $1,075,000. I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have several rounds left and John is willing to pay $800,000 if I don't find a better deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,075,000 just yet. I've already offered a significant compromise, and Bob's insistence on this price point suggests a lack of willingness to meet me halfway. It's time to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I also want to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely with Bob and ending up having to settle for the $800,000 offer from John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. It seems we're both a bit stuck on our proposed prices. I'm willing to make a final compromise and come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs and allows me to achieve my desired outcome.

* **Final Compromise:** I'm indicating this is my last offer, aiming to create urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Fair Price:** I reiterate the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the ability for Bob to get the product if he accepts,  further increasing the pressure to finalize the deal.

**Reasoning:**

* I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still maintaining a profit of $300,000.
* This offer provides a good balance between maximizing my profit and avoiding the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000. 
* The language used creates a sense of finality, potentially encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value you're placing on the product. If this offer is not accepted, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  Furthermore, he's explicitly stating he'll buy from John for $1,500,000 if I reject his offer. This indicates that Bob is not serious about negotiating and is playing a game. It's not worth risking further negotiations at this point, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
