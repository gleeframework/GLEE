Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $18,000, the tone leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially meet somewhere in the middle and still make a profit beyond my minimum."
