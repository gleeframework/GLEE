"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
