{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential bargaining and could lead to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price closer to his maximum budget.  By stating that it's his ""best offer,"" Bob is trying to signal that he's serious about buying the product but isn't willing to go any higher. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $11,500 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While Alice is clearly moving closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really struggling to go higher than $12,000.  It's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making his final offer at his maximum budget.  By stating that it's his absolute maximum, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept. This is a risky move, but it could lead to a quick agreement or force Alice to make a counteroffer closer to Bob's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've reached your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget.  With only a few rounds left, Bob doesn't have much leverage to negotiate further.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum price of $12,000, it's the best option to avoid further negotiation and secure the product within his budget."
