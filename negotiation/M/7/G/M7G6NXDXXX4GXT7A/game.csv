"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Based on its value and potential, I'm asking for $1200000. This is a great opportunity for you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1050000 is slightly out of my range. I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this helps us move closer to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. $950000 is still below my target, but I recognize your budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident it's an offer we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a price of $975000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
