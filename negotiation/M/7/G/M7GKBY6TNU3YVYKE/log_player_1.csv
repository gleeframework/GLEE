Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without being too specific. This aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:**  I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value. There's a risk he might reject the offer outright.
* **Time sensitivity:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.  I need to factor in how long I'm willing to negotiate with Bob before accepting John's offer. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit, but I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
