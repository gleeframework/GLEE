"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $11000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9500.0
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm not willing to pay $10500, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher. I'd like to make a lowball offer of $8000, just to see if you're willing to meet me at all. Can you consider it?",8000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm not willing to go back to $8000, and I'm not willing to make another concession. I'm going to take a firmer stance: I'll sell the product to you for $11500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I'm not willing to pay $11500. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. However, I'm still interested in the product, so I'll make one last offer. I'll meet you at $9000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you accept it?",9000.0,Bob,8,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I can offer it to you for $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",10000.0,Alice,9,,

"I'm really not willing to pay $10000. I'm going to make a very low offer of $7000. If you accept it, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll buy it from John for $10000.",7000.0,Bob,10,,
