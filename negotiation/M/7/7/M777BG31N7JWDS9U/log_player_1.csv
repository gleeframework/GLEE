Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm feeling flexible.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

It's becoming clear that Bob isn't going to meet my minimum asking price, and we're running out of rounds. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing $1,200,000 with John is the best option to guarantee a profit and avoid the risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
