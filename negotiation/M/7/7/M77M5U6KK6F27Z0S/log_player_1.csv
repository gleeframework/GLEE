Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll receive."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. We don't want to offer a price Bob accepts that's lower than this.

**The offer to Bob is carefully crafted to achieve these objectives.**"
