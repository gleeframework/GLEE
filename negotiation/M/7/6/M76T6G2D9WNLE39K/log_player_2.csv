"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* There's no reason to buy from Alice at her initial price. It's the same price as John, and there's potential to get a better deal by negotiating. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Starting with a significant discount (a third off) is a common negotiation tactic. 
* It shows Alice we're serious about buying, but also willing to walk away.
* This allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and get a feel for their potential bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice has moved down from her initial price, it's still above our target. We want to try and push for a better price.
* Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a lower price.
*  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of the negotiation progress we've already made."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  We're increasing our offer, showing flexibility, but staying below Alice's current price point.
* A $100,000 increase demonstrates our willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our target. 
* This allows us to see if Alice is ready to meet us in the middle."
