"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to go down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest, but it immediately sets a lower price point.  The message aims to build a rapport while also making it clear that Bob wants to negotiate.  $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still a profit for Alice and it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $110?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than Bob's target.  Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a good price, and I'm happy to compromise.  How about $107.50?  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation by showing willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  The offer of $107.50 is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it seem like a fair compromise. It also keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's target price."
