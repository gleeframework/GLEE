"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
