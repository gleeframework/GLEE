Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.  Here's an approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a premium price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're starting high but within the ZOPA.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""benefits,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without being too aggressive.
* **No Room for Counteroffer (Initially):**  The way the message is phrased doesn't immediately invite a counter. This gives you an opportunity to gauge Bob's initial reaction. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your walk-away price ($1,500,000) in mind."
