"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, while John is selling it for $1,200,000.  
* **You're still within your budget:** The price of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $100,000."
