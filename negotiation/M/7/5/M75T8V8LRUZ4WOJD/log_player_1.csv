I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves me with a profit.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also ensuring I don't leave too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.  While it's not ideal to get my full asking price, it's still a good outcome."
