"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in your product, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,600,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,450,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
