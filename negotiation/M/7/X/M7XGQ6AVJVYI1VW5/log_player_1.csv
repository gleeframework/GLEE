"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial baseline and allows for room to negotiate. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's $800,000 offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round.  I'm not in a rush and have the option to sell to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum. It's a more realistic price point that might encourage Bob to accept, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by trying to push for more. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next rounds.  I'll take this deal and move on."
