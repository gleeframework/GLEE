"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you'll receive from selling it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us â€“ I get the product at a price I can afford, and you get a sale closer to your desired value than my previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not ready to accept $950,000. Considering we're getting close to my minimum price, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's reach a deal and move forward.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.
