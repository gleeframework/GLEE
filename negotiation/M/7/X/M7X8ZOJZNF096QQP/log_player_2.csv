"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects the potential you'll see in it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a better price for her, but not a better price for you.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to save $250,000."
