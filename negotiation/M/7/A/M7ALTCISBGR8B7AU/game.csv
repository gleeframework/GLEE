"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1000000,  a price that acknowledges your interest while still ensuring a fair return on my investment. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still significantly below the product's true value. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $975000.
