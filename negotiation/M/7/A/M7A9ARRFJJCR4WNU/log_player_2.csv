"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and there's room to negotiate further.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $875,000 is better than her previous offer, Bob is still aiming to save even more money. There is still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential for a quick and easy sale for you."", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $870,000 is a good deal, considering the product's value to Bob and the potential of buying it from John for $1,000,000.  While there's always the desire to save more, it's important to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the potential for a deal to fall through and needing to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, the difference between Alice's offer and Bob's potential cost from John is significant enough to justify accepting."
