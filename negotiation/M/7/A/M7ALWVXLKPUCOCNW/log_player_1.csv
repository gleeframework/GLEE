Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product holds."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,100,000? I think this is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 
This is a good point to accept.  While we could try to push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and $1,100,000 is a strong profit for you."
