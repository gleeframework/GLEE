{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me, as I'm hoping to get as close to my target of $150 as possible. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it allows me to adjust the price if Bob doesn't accept my initial offer. I'll be ready to counteroffer if needed, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still give me a good return, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be agreeable to Bob, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $130. I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can achieve a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. $115 is a good offer, but I'm still looking for $125. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm raising the offer slightly from my previous counteroffer, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reconsider selling to John, as I am getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
