"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, my valuation of the product is significantly higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. If you're willing to consider a price closer to $700,000, I think we could make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we might be able to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference from our last two offers and land at $950,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of this product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, that price is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
