Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price for you.

Remember, you can always use the threat of selling to John for $12,000 as leverage if Bob becomes too difficult to negotiate with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $13,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You can likely get closer to your target by counteroffering.  The threat of selling to John for $12,000 will be helpful leverage if Bob becomes inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that still allows you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
