"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

It's much better to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. $2,000,000 is far above your budget. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm offering Alice half her asking price, $1,000,000. This is a significant discount and still leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to bargain."

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's closer to my ideal price. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. There's a chance she'll come down in price even more, and I don't want to miss that opportunity."

I'm offering Alice $1,500,000, which is halfway between my last offer and her current offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a fair price."
