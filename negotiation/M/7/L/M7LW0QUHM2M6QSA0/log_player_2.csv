"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,000. I think it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating.  While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than John's offer of $12,000 and allows Bob to save $1,750 compared to his initial budget. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice, especially since John is always available as a backup option."
