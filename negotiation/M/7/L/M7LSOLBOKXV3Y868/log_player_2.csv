Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still try to get a better price. He's still got time and should keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,750. How about we try $8,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob.  While it's slightly higher than his target, he's saved $3,125 by negotiating with Alice instead of buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise that achieves his goal of saving money."
