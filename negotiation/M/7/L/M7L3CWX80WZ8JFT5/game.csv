"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This considers both of our positions and feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I'll offer you $1,425,000.  That's a very strong offer and I think it makes sense for both of us to agree on this.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
