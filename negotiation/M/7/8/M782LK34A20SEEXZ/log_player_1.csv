Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it could be of great value to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights the potential value to Bob, not just the price.

**Why not ask for more?**

* If Alice asks for significantly more than $11,999, Bob will likely reject the offer outright, knowing he can find similar value elsewhere.  This would lead Alice to John's offer, which is lower."
