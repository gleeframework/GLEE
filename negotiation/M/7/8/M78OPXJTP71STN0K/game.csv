"I'm interested in your product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can offer you a compromise at $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $110, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $111.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get what we want.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, but I still need to make a profit. How about $113?",113.0,Alice,7,
