"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
