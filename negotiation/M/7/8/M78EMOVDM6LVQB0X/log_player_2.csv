"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm certainly interested in the product, but that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $775,000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $800,000. Since you have the option to buy from John at that exact price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You'll save time and potential frustration by going with John."
