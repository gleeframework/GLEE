Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm certainly interested in the product, but that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $775,000. This is my final compromise."", ""product_price"": 775000}"
