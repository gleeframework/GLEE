"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to keep the cost below $12,000 if possible. Could we perhaps negotiate down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and would like to come closer to meeting you halfway. Would $13,200 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,200 is tempting, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's getting close to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $13,200 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $13,400? This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and am willing to go up to $13,300 for the product. Is this within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I'm still a bit short of my ideal price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk I might not get a better deal in the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of getting nothing, I'll accept Bob's offer."
