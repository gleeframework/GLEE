"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

* It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be able to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* While she has lowered her price, it's still not within your acceptable range. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and potentially find a price point that works for both of you."
