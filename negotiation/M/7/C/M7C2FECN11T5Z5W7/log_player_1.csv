"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John, as time is running out and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. Can you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer getting closer to my minimum but not surpassing it, it's time to cut my losses. I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher in such a short time, and I risk losing both potential buyers if I keep rejecting.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I get a guaranteed sale and meet my minimum price."
