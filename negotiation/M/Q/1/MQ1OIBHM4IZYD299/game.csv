"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
