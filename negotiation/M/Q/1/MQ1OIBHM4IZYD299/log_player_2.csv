"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, and it's likely she's willing to negotiate. I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. I'm still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's likely I won't be able to negotiate a much lower price in subsequent rounds.  It's better to secure the deal now."
