{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) but still above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This creates a space for negotiation. 
* **""Fantastic deal"" and ""valuable asset"":** These phrases are designed to create a positive impression and subtly emphasize the product's value.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to allow Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000).** It's not even close to my initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **It's too risky to accept his offer.**  While I could make a quick sale, I'd be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer, especially if he values the product at $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* If he continues to refuse, I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000?  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,100,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a solution that benefits both parties. This aims to make Bob feel heard and encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,100,000, as it's still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By suggesting finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" I'm subtly implying that time is of the essence and we need to reach an agreement soon.
* **Preparing for a potential final offer:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might consider dropping my price slightly further, but I'll likely be prepared to sell to John if he continues to refuse."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's not enough to justify accepting it.
* **The risk of accepting is too high.**  If I accept his offer, I'd be losing out on a significant amount of potential profit. 
* **Rejecting his offer gives me the chance to potentially secure a better price.**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's possible he might be willing to come up a bit further.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll likely propose a price somewhere between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, depending on my assessment of Bob's negotiating stance. 
* If he continues to refuse, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
