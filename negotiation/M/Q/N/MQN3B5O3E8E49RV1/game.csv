"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less given the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's value to me is quite significant, and $1,000,000 falls short of what I'd consider. I could agree to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant benefit.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you with a substantial profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
