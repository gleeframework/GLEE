"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,500?  That's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,250. Let's see if we can make this happen.",15250.0,Bob,4,
