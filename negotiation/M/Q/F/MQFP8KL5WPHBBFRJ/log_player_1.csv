Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm also factoring in that John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm hoping for a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer, but still below the $1,500,000 I initially proposed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This should make it more likely for Bob to accept while still allowing me to achieve a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only slightly better than John's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better than selling to John and I'm not confident that Bob would go higher."
