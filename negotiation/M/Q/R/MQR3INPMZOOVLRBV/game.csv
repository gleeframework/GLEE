"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think you'll really love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a slightly better price.  Would you be willing to consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
