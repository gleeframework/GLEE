{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also being somewhat flexible. If Bob rejects it, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,250? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, and it's more than what John is offering.  Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high."
