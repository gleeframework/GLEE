Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to entice him to accept. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** I'm trying to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will tell me how serious he is about buying the product.
* **Keep the option open:** I have a fallback option with John, which means I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, it's closer to my goal than his initial value of $800,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get him to pay more by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoid selling at a loss:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise considering the product's value and your eagerness to acquire it.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000.  This shows flexibility and signals that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.
* **Message:** I'm trying to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone, focusing on compromise and fairness.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Moving towards my goal:** $1,050,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's a compromise. 
* **Testing the waters:**  By offering this price, I want to gauge Bob's willingness to meet in the middle.  

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  This offer is very close to my goal, and I'm confident I won't get a much better offer from Bob. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, there's a chance he might walk away completely.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not be worth the potential gain of a few thousand dollars.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
