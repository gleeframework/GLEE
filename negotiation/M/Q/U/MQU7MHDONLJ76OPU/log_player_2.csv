"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount, considering its value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We might be able to get a better price! Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation going smoothly.  
* **Leaving Room:**  While we want to save money, we don't want to lowball Alice to the point of offense. $80 is a significant reduction but still demonstrates serious interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $85. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while providing a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $85 is better than her initial offer, we've still got some wiggle room to potentially snag a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?"",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer proposes a compromise by meeting directly in the middle of the last two prices. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a discount. 
* **Specificity:** The very specific price of $82.50 might make Alice more likely to accept, as it seems like a carefully considered offer."
