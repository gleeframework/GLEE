"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value, making this a fantastic deal for you.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you while still being a great deal for me. Consider this a one-time chance to acquire this valuable product at a price you won't find elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
