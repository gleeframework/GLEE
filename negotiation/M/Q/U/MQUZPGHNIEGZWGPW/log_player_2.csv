It's a good start, but you can aim for a better price.  Let's try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 130}

We're getting closer, but $135 is still above your goal. Let's try to squeeze out another few dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about $132? It's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to get another dollar or two off, at this point, it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting her offer at $133 saves you $17 and is a good deal considering John is selling for $150."
