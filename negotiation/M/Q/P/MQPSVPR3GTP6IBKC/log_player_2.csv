"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, $900,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will move closer to a price point that makes more sense for Bob before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. Since John offers the product for $800,000, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John and save $50,000. There's little point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when a better option is available."
