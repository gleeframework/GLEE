Our current offer stands at $100, which we believe is a fair price given the value of the product.

Alice is firm on her price, but there's still a gap between her price and what you're willing to pay.  You can try a counteroffer again, but be prepared to walk away if she's not willing to budge."

Please let me know if this is something you'd like to proceed with.
