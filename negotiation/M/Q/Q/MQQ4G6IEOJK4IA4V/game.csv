,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you. Let's close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference at $11,125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",11125.0,Alice,7,
