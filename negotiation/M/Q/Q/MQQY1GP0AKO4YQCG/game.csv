"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
