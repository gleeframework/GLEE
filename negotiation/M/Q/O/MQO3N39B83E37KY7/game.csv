"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
