"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
