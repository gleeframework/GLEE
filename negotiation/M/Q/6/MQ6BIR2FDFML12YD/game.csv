"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This price still leaves you with a profit, and it's closer to what I'm able to spend. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750?  This price is a good compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
