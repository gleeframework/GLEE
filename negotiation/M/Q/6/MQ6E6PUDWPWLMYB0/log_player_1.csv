Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility but still staying above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and secure a price closer to my minimum."

Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway. While I'd prefer to make a sale, it's more important to secure my minimum price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so I'll sell to him."
