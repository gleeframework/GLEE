**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,250,000 and is only making very small concessions.  The gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are likely to be minimal, and the time spent haggling could be used to pursue other opportunities. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the most profitable and efficient decision at this point."
