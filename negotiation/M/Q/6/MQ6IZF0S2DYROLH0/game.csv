,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $81, as I've already compromised quite a bit. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus that adds significant value to the product. I can offer you the product for $81, and I'll also include a premium service that's usually worth $10. This way, you'll get an even better deal than before. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer of the premium service, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $79, and I'm willing to accept the premium service as part of the deal. Can you consider that?",79.0,Bob,8,
