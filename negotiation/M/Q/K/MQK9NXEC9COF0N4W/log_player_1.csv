"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob can make him more willing to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's still a bit above my budget, but I'm interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options before resorting to selling to John.
* **Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable compromise. 

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider this compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value proposition again, reminding Bob that even at $11,000, he's still getting a great deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground that acknowledges both our positions.  I'm confident that $11,000 is still a good price for me, while being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Closing the Gap:**  While his offer is closer to my desired price, it's not close enough to make it worthwhile to sell now. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially given his interest in the product.

**Strategy:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000, but to show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant concession on my part. Let me know if this feels like a fair compromise for you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating further flexibility by lowering my price to $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm serious about finding common ground.
* **Emphasis on Concession:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise, hoping to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and reason.

**Strategy:**  By making this significant concession, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price range. If this offer fails, I'll carefully consider my next move, weighing the potential of further negotiation against the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is only $5,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with no sale at all. 

**Strategy:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action at this point. It allows me to secure a sale and avoid the potential risk of losing the deal completely."
