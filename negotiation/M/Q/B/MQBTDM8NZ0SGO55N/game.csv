"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best offer at this time.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it reflects the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me here, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
