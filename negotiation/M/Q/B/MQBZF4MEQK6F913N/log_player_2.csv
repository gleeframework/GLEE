# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much as possible. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to budge a little, but her offer of $145 is still above your desired price point. You can try to negotiate further to get closer to your target of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $135. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $142. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $142, which is closer to your target price of $130 and still within your budget of $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  At this point, it's probably a good idea to accept and secure the product."
