"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $8,000 to you and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with the new offer. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? That's the highest I can go.",8250.0,Bob,4,
