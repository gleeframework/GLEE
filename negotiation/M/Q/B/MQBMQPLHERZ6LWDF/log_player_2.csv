"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  You should definitely counter-offer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and professional:** Maintains a positive tone for continued negotiation.
* **Expresses interest:** Shows you're serious about buying but not at any price.
* **Anchors low:** Starts the negotiation significantly below Alice's asking price, leaving room to move up while staying within your budget.
* **Provides a reason:** Citing your budget makes the counter-offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is below my minimum. I can meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down significantly, $14,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? I'm ready to buy if you can make that work."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges progress:**  Recognizing Alice's movement keeps the negotiation moving positively.
* **Firm but fair:**  Holds firm on your budget limitations while proposing a price closer to Alice's desired range.
* **Signals urgency:**  Adding ""ready to buy""  implies this is a close-to-final offer to encourage Alice to agree. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  Leaves room for one more potential counter-offer closer to $12,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000 and has signaled this is her final offer. Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed saving at this point."
