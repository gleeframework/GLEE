"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $120.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's price and still within Bob's budget, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to save money."
