"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value for this product. It represents a unique opportunity and its potential returns are substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a much higher price and can afford to push back a bit more.  We'll counter with a price closer to our minimum to signal we're getting closer to our bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, selling this for anything less than $1,250,000 would be difficult for me.  This is a significant discount already, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement on this."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd prefer a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,150,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or us having to settle for John's offer later in the negotiation."
