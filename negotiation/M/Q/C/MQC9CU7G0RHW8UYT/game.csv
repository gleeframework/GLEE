"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value for this product. It represents a unique opportunity and its potential returns are substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, selling this for anything less than $1,250,000 would be difficult for me.  This is a significant discount already, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement on this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
