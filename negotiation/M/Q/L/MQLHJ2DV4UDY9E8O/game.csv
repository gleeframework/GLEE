"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
