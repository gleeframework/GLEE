Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to earn at least $15,000, so any price below that is unacceptable.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer a price that is at least somewhat appealing to him.
* **Negotiation room:**  A price of $13,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially counteroffer. This gives us both the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price within a reasonable range. 
* **John as a backup:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob.

This initial offer aims to strike a balance between getting the best price possible and leaving room for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to earn at least $15,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. 
* **Negotiation:** Although Bob's offer is low, it shows that he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to accept a price that is so far below my minimum.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While my minimum is $15,000, I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  $11,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Remaining above minimum:** This price is still significantly higher than what Bob offered, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **John's influence:**  Knowing that I have John as a backup for $15,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum not met:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited negotiation:** I've already lowered my price twice, and further concessions would be too risky, as I'm getting closer to my minimum and Bob's offer isn't increasing substantially.
* **John's guarantee:** Selling to John ensures that I reach my minimum goal. The risk of further negotiation is higher than the certainty of John's deal. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially lose out on a better deal."
