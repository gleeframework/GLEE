I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get a much better deal. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
