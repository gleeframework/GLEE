"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far beyond your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a fallback option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still potentially attractive to her.  This gives us room to negotiate, and shows Alice that I am serious about getting a good deal.  I am also leaving a significant amount of room for Alice to make a counteroffer, which is likely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and drive the price down further.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows me to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,000,000. This is my maximum budget, and it's a strong signal to Alice that I'm serious about acquiring the product.  I'm hoping that Alice is willing to accept this offer as it is a significant compromise from her previous price.  If she rejects it, I can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While there's a chance she might come down further, I've already made my maximum offer and it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at my maximum budget.  Buying from John ensures I get the product within my budget."
