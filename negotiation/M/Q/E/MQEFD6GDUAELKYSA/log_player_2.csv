"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. I believe this price reflects its high quality and value, while still allowing you to enjoy significant savings compared to its market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it at $100. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and I can get the product for $120 from John. There's no point in further negotiation."
