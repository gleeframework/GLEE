"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $165 is close enough to my target price of $170, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might risk getting a lower price or even losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer will give me a good profit while ensuring I close the deal."
