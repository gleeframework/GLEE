"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product. This still reflects its true value to us, while being more accessible to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",10500.0,Alice,3,
