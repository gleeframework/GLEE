"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is a good price, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This will test her willingness to negotiate and give me some room to compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer.  Accepting at $110 saves me $40 compared to buying from John, and I'm still within my $150 budget.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice walking away is increasing."
