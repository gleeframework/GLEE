"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is 20% higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate and allows for potential counteroffers.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to agree while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer again, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned. We are halfway through the negotiations, and if I don't find common ground soon, selling to John for $10,000 might be the best option.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'll need to be more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $10,500. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also ensuring I don't lose too much money.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm also going to seriously consider selling to John if this doesn't work out.  We are running out of time, and I need to make sure I get a reasonable price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm dropping my price down to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum. If Bob doesn't accept this, I will sell the product to John for $10,000. I'm hoping Bob understands that this is the best I can do and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We are down to the last few rounds, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I've already made a significant concession by lowering my price to my absolute minimum.  It's better to secure the deal with John and get my minimum value than risk getting stuck with a lower price or losing out on the opportunity entirely."
