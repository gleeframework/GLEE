Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130.  This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm also keeping John in mind, as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
