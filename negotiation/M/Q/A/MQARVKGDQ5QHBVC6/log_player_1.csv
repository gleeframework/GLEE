Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'll accept his offer and move on."
