(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price. You have a strong negotiating position since you have a fallback option with John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's likely that further negotiation will not bring the price down enough to be worthwhile.  You are better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at your desired price."
