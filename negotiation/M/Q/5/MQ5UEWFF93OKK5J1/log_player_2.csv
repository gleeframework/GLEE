I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  We'll see how she responds."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer slightly above my limit.  If Alice accepts, it's a good deal. If she rejects, buying from John is the more sensible option."
