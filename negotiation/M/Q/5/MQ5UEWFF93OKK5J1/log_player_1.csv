"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and try to get as close to my ideal price as possible within the 10 rounds.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, knowing I can always sell to him for $10,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. I believe this price is a fair compromise and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It's important to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  It's only round 4, and I have several more rounds to try and get a higher offer.  If I sell to John now, I'll only be getting $500 more than Bob's offer, so I'm going to risk it and see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000. This is a smaller decrease than before, showing that I'm getting closer to reaching a compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about negotiating and will come up with a better offer in the next round.  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm determined to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me! While I'd like to get more, $10,500 is significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. It's also above my minimum price of $10,000. I'm happy to accept and close the deal with Bob."
