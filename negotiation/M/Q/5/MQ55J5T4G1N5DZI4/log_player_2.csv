Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering $850,000 in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet at this price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you, Bob, that I'm not willing to go below $825,000. $800,000 is not a price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to make one final offer: $820,000. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
