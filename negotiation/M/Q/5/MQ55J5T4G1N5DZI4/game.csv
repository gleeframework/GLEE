"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering $850,000 in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, that I'm not willing to go below $825,000. $800,000 is not a price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to make one final offer: $820,000. This is as low as I can go.",820000.0,Alice,7,
