"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price still gives you a significant value advantage, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but that price is still a bit too high for me. How about $900,000? That's a substantial offer and shows I'm serious.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that gives you a valuable asset and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $950,000 to make this deal happen. That's a very strong offer considering my initial budget.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this work. $950,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit too far from my ideal price point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's get this done!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is important to both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 to finalize this deal. That's a significant investment for me and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest.  While $975,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to close this deal.  How about $990,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. It's a win-win situation. Let's make this happen!",990000.0,Alice,9,
