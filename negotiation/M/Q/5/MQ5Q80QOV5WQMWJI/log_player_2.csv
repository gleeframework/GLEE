Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this work. $950,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit too far from my ideal price point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's get this done!

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest.  While $975,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to close this deal.  How about $990,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. It's a win-win situation. Let's make this happen!

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. While she's come down in price, she's unlikely to reach a price point that makes sense for you. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which saves you a significant amount compared to Alice's latest offer."
