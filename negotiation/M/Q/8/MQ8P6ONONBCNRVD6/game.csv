"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond my current budget. I could potentially go up to $10,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,500.
