Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $120 minimum, but not setting the bar so high that it instantly makes Bob walk away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's space to bargain if he counters.
* **It's positive and engaging:** The message encourages Bob to consider the offer and start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is below the initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $120.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
