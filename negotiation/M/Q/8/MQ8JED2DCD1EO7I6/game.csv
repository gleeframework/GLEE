"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $925,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $850,000, Bob, but I'm still not getting a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own minimum price. I can do $900,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
