Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already come down significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $16,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $15,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
