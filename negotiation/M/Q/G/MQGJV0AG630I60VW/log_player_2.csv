"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her price to $980,000, which is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. At this point, the risk of further negotiation is high.  There's a good chance that Alice will not lower her price further, and Bob might end up not getting the product.  It's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring that he gets the product within his budget."
