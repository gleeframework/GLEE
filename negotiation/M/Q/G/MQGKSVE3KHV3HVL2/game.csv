"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is much higher than that.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $9500. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $12000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
