"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Alice has already lowered her price, and Bob knows that he can get the product from John for $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,000,000 is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it elsewhere for the same price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his absolute limit of $1,000,000. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Given that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying the product from John at $1,000,000 is the most financially sound decision."
