Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

You want to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay that's still beneficial for him. Offering anything below $12,000 is a loss for you since you have a guaranteed buyer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,999, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting near your minimum acceptable price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Justification:**  You're acknowledging the value it holds for Bob, making him feel like the price is justified.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a small discount (just $1 less than your guaranteed sale) might be enough to entice Bob without significantly impacting your profit.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product. If you had more information, you might adjust your strategy."
