"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  While I recognize its potential, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be happy to offer $900000 for the product. This reflects a fair value based on my understanding of the market and its potential for growth. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial starting point for further discussion.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to me and the market potential, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a more reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the potential of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950000. This represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product and the market potential, I'm willing to come down to $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1025000 is getting closer to where I need to be. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $975000. I believe this offer reflects a fair price considering the product's potential and the market conditions.  Let's work together to bridge this small gap and finalize this agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product and the market potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $1025000. I'm offering the product to you for $1000000, which is the same price John is willing to pay. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
