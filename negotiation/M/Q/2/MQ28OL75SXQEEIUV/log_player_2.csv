# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is sufficient for this product. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. I'm thinking of a price of $975,000. Can you consider this offer?
