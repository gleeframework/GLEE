Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's still a better deal than selling to John, and we're close to the end of the rounds.  There's a good chance Bob won't budge any further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
