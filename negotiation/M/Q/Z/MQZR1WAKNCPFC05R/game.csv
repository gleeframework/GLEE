,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this work for me. How about $8,500?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about $7,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $8,250 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
