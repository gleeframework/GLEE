"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low for me, and I can get $8,000 from John.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this work for me. How about $8,500?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about $7,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,750 is closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum. I can get $8,000 from John, so I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $8,250 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is finally offering me my minimum price of $8,000.  There's no reason to keep negotiating.  I'm happy to accept his offer."
