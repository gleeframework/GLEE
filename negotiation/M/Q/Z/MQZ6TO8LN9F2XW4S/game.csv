"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $7000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident you'll agree this is still a great deal for such a valuable product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7500 just doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's try one last compromise. How about $8250? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
