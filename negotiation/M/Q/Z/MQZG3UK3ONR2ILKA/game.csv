"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $12000. I would like to propose a price of $10000 if that is within your consideration.",10000.0,Bob,4,

However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and sell it to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
