"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save a lot of money by negotiating with Alice. While $950,000 is still a decent deal, it's better to see if Alice will lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer. Since Alice values the product at $800,000, this offer gives her a $50,000 profit margin, which is still a good deal for her. This approach aims to quickly establish a lower price point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  He has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. It makes sense to continue exploring options before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to secure a good deal.  This counteroffer offers Alice a $75,000 profit margin, which should be attractive to her while still being a good price for Bob."
