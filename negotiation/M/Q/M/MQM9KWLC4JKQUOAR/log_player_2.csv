"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds. What do you think?

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(""It's closer to my budget, but I think I can get it lower."") 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll go down to $8,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

```tool_code
print(""Great! I'll accept your offer of $8,000."")
``` 

It's no longer worth haggling further. Alice has met my upper limit, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal."
