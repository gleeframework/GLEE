Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob a decent discount from what I think the product is worth, but also leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  I'm hoping to get as close to $150 as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$120 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with, and selling to John would guarantee me a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but will not accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close enough to my minimum price of $150 that I'm willing to accept it. While selling to John would be slightly more profitable, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely."
