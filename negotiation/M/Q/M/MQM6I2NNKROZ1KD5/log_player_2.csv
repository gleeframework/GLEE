"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal that provides you with significant value. While I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price ($1,250,000 vs. $1,000,000).
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might incentivize her to lower the price closer to your limit.  

**Strategy:**  You are in a strong negotiating position.  Let Alice sweat a little, she has more to lose than you do."
