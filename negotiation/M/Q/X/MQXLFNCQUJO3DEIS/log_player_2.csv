# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $900,000. What do you think?

``` 

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.
* It's worth negotiating further to see if Bob can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $875,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $875,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,000,000.
* This is a better deal than buying from John, who is selling for $1,000,000.
* While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are smaller, and it's likely that Alice won't go much lower. 
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product and save $125,000 compared to buying from John."
