"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer is close to Alice's value of the product ($8,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's target, there's still some wiggle room.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his ideal.  He also needs to consider the number of rounds remaining - he has 7 left, giving him time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer increases his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise. However, he's still keeping the price below $9,000, aiming to get a better deal. This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while keeping his goal of saving money in mind."
