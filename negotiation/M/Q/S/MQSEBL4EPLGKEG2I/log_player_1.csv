{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit margin while still being attractive to Bob since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. This opens the door for negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a substantial amount, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me and falls below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```
This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, while remaining  a good deal for Bob as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still below my initial desired price, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  It's likely that further negotiation would take time and there's no guarantee of a better outcome."
