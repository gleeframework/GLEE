"I'm interested in your product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. Can we compromise on that?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
