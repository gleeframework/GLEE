"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset and this price reflects its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Opening with a high offer (significantly higher than my minimum) allows room for negotiation and gives me a better starting position.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Mentioning the product's potential helps Bob see the value and encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly implies I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only afford $1000000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.** I cannot accept such a low price as it's well below my floor price of $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John is a viable option.** While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John's offer is still within my acceptable range.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round, while still keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,750,000. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair value for the product.
* **Focusing on compromise:**  The message highlights that I'm trying to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  Even though I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in entirely. The counteroffer is still a good price for me and shows that I'm serious about getting a reasonable price.

**Next Steps:** I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, always considering the potential of selling to John if a deal with Bob isn't possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1750000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While he's increasing his offer, it's still not in my acceptable range. I'm determined to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option.** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John's offer is a safe alternative.
* **Further negotiation is necessary.**  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'll need to be careful not to let the negotiations drag on too long, however, as time is a factor.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still showing flexibility. I'll also be mindful of the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to try and reach a deal.  This offer is still a good value for you, and it's the lowest I can go while still achieving my minimum desired price. I'm confident that this product will be worth the investment for you in the long run. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, but I'm only willing to go down to $1,600,000 which is still above my minimum. This shows that I'm making a genuine effort to meet Bob halfway.
* **Highlighting Long-Term Value:** Emphasizing the product's long-term potential can encourage Bob to see the value beyond the immediate price.
* **Clear Signal of Finality:**  I'm making it clear that this is likely my final offer. I'm not going to keep lowering my price indefinitely, and Bob needs to decide if he's truly interested.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll closely analyze Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects again, I might consider selling to John in the next round to avoid wasting any more time. 
* **Prepare for a Potential Deal:** If Bob accepts, I'll be prepared to move forward with the transaction. If he counteroffers, I'll need to carefully evaluate his new offer and decide if it's acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1600000 is getting closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground here to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** Even though he's raised his offer, it's still not enough for me. I'm not willing to compromise my minimum price of $1,500,000, especially after already making significant concessions.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 6, and there are only 4 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks me losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.
* **John offers a safe alternative:**  John's offer is a guaranteed sale for a price that is acceptable to me.  It's a much safer bet than risking further negotiations with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John is the most practical and sensible decision at this point. It ensures that I reach my minimum price target without risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
