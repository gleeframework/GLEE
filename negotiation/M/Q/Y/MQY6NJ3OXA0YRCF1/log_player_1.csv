Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves a reasonable profit margin for me. 
* I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter with a new price, or simply move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I don't want to settle for a price that's too far below my value. 
* I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counter-offering with a price of $14,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable compromise that gives Bob a better price than my original offer while still securing me a good profit. 
* I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price considering the product's value to him. 
* If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider whether to accept his next counteroffer or move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to compromise any further. 
* I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, so I'm going to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially resulting in a lower sale price."
