Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (1.5 times Bob's perceived value) positions it as a premium item. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""excited to offer"" and ""believe this reflects its true worth"" convey value and encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
