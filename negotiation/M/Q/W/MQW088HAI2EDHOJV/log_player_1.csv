Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me, since the product is worth $10,000 to him. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I believe I can get a better price if I counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my original offer and only $1,000 more than his offer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise that will lead to a deal."
