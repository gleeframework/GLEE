"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $12,000 for a product worth $10,000 to you.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still potentially appealing to her.  It also leaves room for further bargaining if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $11,000. While you could continue negotiating, at this point it's likely that further negotiation would lead to a lot of back and forth. Accepting her offer means you get the product for a price that is within your budget and only slightly higher than what you'd pay to John."
