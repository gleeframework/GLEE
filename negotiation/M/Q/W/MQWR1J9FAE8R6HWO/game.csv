"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I propose we set the product price at $11,000. This offer still allows for a reasonable profit while being competitive with your initial proposal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
