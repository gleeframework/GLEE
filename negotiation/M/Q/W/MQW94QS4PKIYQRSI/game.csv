"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1000000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $1050000 to make it worth my while. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
