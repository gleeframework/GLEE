"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $11,000 is still a little bit outside my budget. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
