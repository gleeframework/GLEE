Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $400,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $600,000 is simply too low.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap here. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, it's nowhere near the $1,000,000 baseline. I'm willing to negotiate further but holding firm to encourage a more substantial offer."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer. While it's a significant increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk Bob walking away, leaving me with nothing."
