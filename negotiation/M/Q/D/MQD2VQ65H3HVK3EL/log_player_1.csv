"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum value of $80. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. It's still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $85, which is closer to my desired price and still a good profit for me.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
