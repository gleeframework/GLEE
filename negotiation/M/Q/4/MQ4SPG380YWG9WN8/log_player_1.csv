Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, increasing the likelihood he'll accept.  However, I'm still leaving myself open to negotiation and willing to walk away if I don't feel the price is right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and a good profit."
