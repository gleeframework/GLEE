Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $13,500? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $13,500 remains beyond my budget. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product, but I can't go higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $9,500 is too low.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm convinced that $10,000 is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to me while allowing you to get a reasonable return. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's consistently stayed below $10,000, showing resistance to approaching my minimum. Accepting his $10,000 offer means a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sure deal with John."
