"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $13,500? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $13,500 remains beyond my budget. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product, but I can't go higher.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $9,500 is too low.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm convinced that $10,000 is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to me while allowing you to get a reasonable return. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
