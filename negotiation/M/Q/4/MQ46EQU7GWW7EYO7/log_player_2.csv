Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  John offers a much better deal at $8,000, which is within Bob's budget. Bob should buy from John to save the most money."
