"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings is truly significant. I could come down to $900,000, which I feel is a very competitive offer.  This is a small concession for something that can yield such substantial returns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly above John's offer. There's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $890,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to stretch to $880,000. Can you meet me at that price?

**Reasoning:**  While we're slightly below our target, accepting $880,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
