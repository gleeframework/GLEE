Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $10,300? It's still a great price for this product, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently coming down in price, but in smaller increments.  While we might be able to get a slightly better deal, the difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $10,300 saves time and avoids the risk of the price going back up or missing the deal altogether."
