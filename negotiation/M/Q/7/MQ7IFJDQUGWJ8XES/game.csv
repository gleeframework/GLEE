"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9,750. How about we meet again at $10,250? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a great price for this product. I think it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $10,300? It's still a great price for this product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10300.0,Alice,7,
