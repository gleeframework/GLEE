Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting price of $1,300,000 allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" you create a sense that the product is worth more than Bob might initially think. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer goes below a price you find acceptable, remember you can always fall back on your deal with John."
