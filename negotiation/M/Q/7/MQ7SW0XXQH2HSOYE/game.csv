"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, my product is worth more than $60 to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $100 for it. How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for it. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
