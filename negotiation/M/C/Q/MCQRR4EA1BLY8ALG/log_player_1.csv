{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, given your line of work. I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and its potential for your business. Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business and the market price. I'm open to negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent offer, I can still push for a better price.  I believe I can get closer to my ideal price point, and I have several rounds to do so."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds for your operations. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this deal to work for me. This price still offers you a significant profit margin and a valuable asset for your business. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from your original offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some movement from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product. I'm prepared to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,275,000. This price reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to ensure a fair return on my investment. It's the best offer I can give, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,225,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can understand my perspective. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's final offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable value.  If I reject this, I risk him going to John, which would mean I'd get a significantly lower price.  Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
