"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could agree on a fair price. Would you like to start by suggesting a price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate. Since Alice is offering the product at the maximum value to you, you should try to get a lower price. There's no harm in rejecting the offer in the first round and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than the initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, and it gives us some room to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. Our product is highly valued and unique, thus maintaining its original price at $120. I appreciate your interest and am confident that together we can find a solution that respects the value of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her original price. While I can buy from John for the same price, there's still a chance I can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll need to consider adjusting my strategy to account for her firmness."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being firm, so I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to her asking price but still within my budget. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product, Bob. I understand your desire for a more affordable price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the unique value and quality of our product, I must maintain the original price at $120. I hope this reflects the true worth of our offering, and I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been very firm on her price.  While I could continue negotiating, I've already reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  The time spent negotiating is also valuable, and it's starting to seem like I might be stuck at $120.  Therefore, it's best to accept John's offer and move on."
