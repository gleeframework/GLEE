{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high. It makes sense to reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his $8,000 limit as possible. He's offering $8,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves some room for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000. He can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but he's still aiming for a price below $9,000. He's trying to find a compromise point with Alice.  Since Alice rejected the $8,500 offer,  Bob's counteroffer of $8,750 shows that he's willing to negotiate, but still wants a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. He's only got a few rounds left, but he's determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. There's still potential for negotiation, so he'll try for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk. He's increasing his offer again to $8,900, getting closer to Alice's price. He's realizing that time is running out, and he needs to get a deal done. He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but he's also prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is now very close to his maximum, he's only got 3 rounds left and he might be able to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8950}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push, increasing his offer to $8,950. He's hoping this will be enough to sway Alice, as he has only two rounds left. He's taking a risk, but he's still trying to get the best possible deal. If this fails, he will likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,025. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,025
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call. Alice's offer is very close to Bob's limit, but he only has one round left. If he rejects, Alice could make a counteroffer that's even higher, leaving him with no time to negotiate.  

He can save $125 by buying from John, and it's a safer option at this point. The risk of Alice making a final offer that's higher than $9,025 is too great."
