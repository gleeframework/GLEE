Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly higher than John's offer, we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, we can always come down closer to our minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still keeping the offer within a reasonable range for Bob."
