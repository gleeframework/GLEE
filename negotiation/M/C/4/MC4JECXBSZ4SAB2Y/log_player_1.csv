Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 120}
