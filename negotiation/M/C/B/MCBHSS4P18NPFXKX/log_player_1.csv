Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000, but it's a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from this point.  

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Provides a benchmark:** It helps me understand how much Bob values the product. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I still have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Next Steps:**

*  Wait for Bob's response. 
*  If Bob rejects, move on to selling to John.
*  If Bob accepts, consider negotiating further based on his willingness to pay."
