"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, to be honest, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $700,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $762,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting the difference. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 was a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you at $825,000 is not an option, so I'll try to meet you in the middle of $825,000 and $762,500, which is $793,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",793750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to come down just a bit more. How about $780,000?  That's my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not comfortable going below $800,000, as I have another buyer interested in the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",795000.0,Alice,9,
