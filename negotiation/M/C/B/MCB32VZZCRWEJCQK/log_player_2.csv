"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. You have plenty of room to negotiate down from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, it sets a strong anchoring point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives you space to gradually increase your bid over the remaining rounds if needed. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This bold counteroffer will help you gauge how much Alice is willing to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $850,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and leaves limited room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further, especially since you've shown a willingness to walk away from the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, to be honest, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $700,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing your offer to $700,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying well below Alice's current price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice by highlighting the gap between your offer and her expectations.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This offer leaves space for a potential compromise in the next round, perhaps around the $750,000 mark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:**  Alice is clearly signaling that she's getting closer to her bottom line by only dropping the price by $25,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You still have five rounds left and the option to go with John. There's no need to rush. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Aiming Lower:** You should be able to get the price below $800,000, especially since Alice hasn't given any indication that this is her absolute lowest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $762,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 762500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Compromise:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise but firmly positions it closer to your previous offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By round 6, you're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. This offer subtly reminds Alice of the time constraint.
* **Potential Final Offer:** Depending on Alice's response, this price point could be close to your final offer before considering John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting the difference. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 was a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you at $825,000 is not an option, so I'll try to meet you in the middle of $825,000 and $762,500, which is $793,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $793,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $793,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** Alice is clearly getting closer to her valuation, but you're within striking distance of a better deal.
* **Leverage:** You still have three rounds and John's offer as backup. There's no need to jump at this offer just yet.
* **Final Push:** One more well-placed counteroffer might be enough to secure a price below $790,000."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to come down just a bit more. How about $780,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about closing the deal but not willing to budge much further. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Stating this is your final offer creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is a good balance between an attractive deal for you and a potentially acceptable offer for Alice, considering her previous concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not comfortable going below $800,000, as I have another buyer interested in the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has revealed her likely true valuation ($800,000). It's unlikely she'll go lower, especially with another interested buyer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  You're down to the wire with only one round left. If you reject this offer, you risk losing out on both Alice's deal and John's backup.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not your ideal target, $795,000 is a solid price and saves you $205,000 compared to John's offer."
