"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting price is $1150000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1050000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is still fair to both of us and allows for a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
