"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting price is $1150000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1150000 is a bit too high for me. Given what I know about the product, I'm willing to offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1050000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is still fair to both of us and allows for a successful transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a little high. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
