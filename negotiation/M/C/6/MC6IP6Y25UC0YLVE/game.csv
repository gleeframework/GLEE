"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet halfway at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,900,000 is close, but I need to be sure this is the right decision for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,950,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this product. Would you be willing to match that offer?",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,920,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",1920000.0,Bob,6,
