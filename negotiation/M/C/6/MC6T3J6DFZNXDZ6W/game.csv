"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant compromise from my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
