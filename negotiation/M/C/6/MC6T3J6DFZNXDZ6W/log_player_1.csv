{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves a healthy profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely for him to accept. 
* **Strategic thinking:** By offering a price slightly below my minimum, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. If he doesn't come up to my price, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to facilitate a deal. Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $1,050,000 is a compromise, offering Bob a significant discount while still allowing me to make a profit. This price is halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly express my desire for a higher price. I highlight my willingness to compromise, making the counteroffer seem more appealing.
* **Strategy:** By showing flexibility and offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, I increase the chances of reaching an agreement while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me.  I am willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that leaves me significantly below my goal.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $1,000,000 is a further compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I am attempting to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's constraints while emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.  This message uses a more assertive tone to push for a deal.
* **Strategy:**  By offering a price that is closer to Bob's, I am increasing the pressure on him to accept.  If he rejects this offer, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This strategy gives me leverage while still remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions and have reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a much better outcome, ensuring I achieve my financial goals."
