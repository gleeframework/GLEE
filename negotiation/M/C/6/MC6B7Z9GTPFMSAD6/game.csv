"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. $11,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000? This feels like a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
