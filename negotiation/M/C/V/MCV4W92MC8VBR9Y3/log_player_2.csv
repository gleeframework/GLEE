"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and get a better deal before committing. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price for the product would be $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's desired price. While it's a compromise, Bob can still try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob can still try to negotiate further, it's getting closer to his desired price and there's a risk of going too low and losing the deal. It's also worth considering that there are only five rounds left, and time is running out.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount of money compared to buying it from John."
