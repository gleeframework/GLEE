"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price for the product would be $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
