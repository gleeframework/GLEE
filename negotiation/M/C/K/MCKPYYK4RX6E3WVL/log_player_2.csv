Alice is stuck on a price point that's not beneficial to you. She's gone back up to $975,000 and called it her ""last chance"" twice now. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly in the remaining rounds. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
