Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you a significant profit. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your absolute bottom line can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, increasing the chances he'll accept. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. However, this strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
