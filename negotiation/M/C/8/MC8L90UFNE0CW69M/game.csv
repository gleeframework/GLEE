"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it doesn't fully account for the unique advantages this product offers. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think we can do better. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
