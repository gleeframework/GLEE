"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that suits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  While $800,000 is a significant undervaluation, I understand you have a budget in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter.  While that's closer, it's still a bit rich for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
