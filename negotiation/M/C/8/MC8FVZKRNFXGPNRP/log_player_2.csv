"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that suits us both.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  While $800,000 is a significant undervaluation, I understand you have a budget in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.
