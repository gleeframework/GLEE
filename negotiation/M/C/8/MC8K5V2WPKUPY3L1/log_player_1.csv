Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my target ($14,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the significant value Bob gets by emphasizing the difference between my offer and his perceived worth ($15,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net, so I can be flexible if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest. I can use this as a starting point for counter-negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $12,000 would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still offers you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not completely conceding. $13,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I emphasize the value Bob gets by mentioning the discount compared to his perceived worth.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages further negotiation.

By offering $13,000, I'm aiming for a middle ground while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would mean a loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Although Bob is getting closer to my price, there is still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would be safe, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price with Bob.  

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This offer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500.
* **Finality:**  I emphasize ""finalizing this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that $12,500 is still a good deal.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I am still aware of John's offer, so I can accept $12,000 if necessary. However, I am aiming for a slightly higher price with Bob."
