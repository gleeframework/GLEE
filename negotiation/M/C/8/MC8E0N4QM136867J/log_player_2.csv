"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an amazing opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. Would you like to make an offer for $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still a decent starting point for negotiation.
* **Show interest:**  Mentioning that you're interested in the product keeps the negotiation going.
* **Be polite:** Maintaining a friendly tone will make Alice more likely to work with you."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:** While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still higher than your maximum of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** You still have 7 rounds left to bargain. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get Alice to come down even further. 
* **John is a safety net:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $10,000 if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you go down to $10,000? That's my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:**  State your absolute limit upfront to avoid further back-and-forth.
* **Show Commitment:**  Reinforce your interest in the product by emphasizing you're willing to meet at your maximum price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11000?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:**  $11,000 is still more than your maximum of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk of not being able to negotiate further. 
* **Guaranteed deal with John:** Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price, avoiding further negotiation and potential risk. 

It's important to prioritize your financial goals and ensure you don't overspend. Buying from John is the safest and most budget-friendly option at this point."
