Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could make, considering her goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  A price too close to $12,000 might seem like Alice is trying to extract all the value, potentially making Bob less likely to accept.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John. Offering the product to Bob at $11,500 significantly increases her chances of getting a better price, even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Alice could choose a more aggressive opening price, especially if she's a strong negotiator or suspects Bob might be very eager to buy."
