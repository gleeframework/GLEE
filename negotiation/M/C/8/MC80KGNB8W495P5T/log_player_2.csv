This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $975,000, a saving of $525,000 from John's price and a good reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's indicated this is her best offer, implying she might not budge much further.
* **Limited Rounds:** You're getting close to the end of the negotiation window, increasing the risk of missing out on a deal with Alice. 

While you might be able to push Alice a little lower, it's risky. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potential negotiation fatigue."
