"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business. It's something that could significantly boost your operations and increase your revenue. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to you, and it's a price that ensures both of us benefit from this deal. If you're interested, let's discuss further. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product from John for the same price as your budget limit. This means you don't save any money, but you also don't risk spending more than you're willing to."
