"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  Even though $120 is my minimum, I can try to get a higher price from Bob.  If I fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. This is a better price than John's offer and it's likely that Bob won't go higher.  There are still rounds remaining, but I'd rather secure a sale now and move on."
