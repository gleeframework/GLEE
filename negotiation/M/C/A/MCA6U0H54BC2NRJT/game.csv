"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid wasting any more time.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,380,000?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
