It's clear Alice's offer is far too high.  There's no reason to accept it when John is offering a much better price."

I'm going to start with John's price, as that's my absolute limit.  I'm hoping Alice will see that it's a fair offer, but I'm ready to walk away if she doesn't."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not within my budget. I'm going to see if I can get her closer to $8,000 with another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}

I'm going to increase my offer a bit more, but I'm still keeping it below $9,000. This is a fair price, given that I'm willing to go as high as $8,000 with John."
