"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1280000. How about we split the difference and I pay $1240000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",1240000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1240000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1290000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
