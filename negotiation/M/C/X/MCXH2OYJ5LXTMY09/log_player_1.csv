Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your absolute bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""benefits"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is high, it's not ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. This leaves space for a counteroffer and continued negotiation.

**Remember:**  You have John as a backup, guaranteeing you at least $1,200,000.  Therefore, you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still substantially lower than your minimum and John's guaranteed offer.  There's room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer with a price closer to your desired outcome but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a significant investment, the value this product brings justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've made a $50,000 concession, signaling flexibility but also indicating the price is firming up.
* **Value Reiteration:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Midpoint Target:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, which is a common negotiation tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is negotiating in smaller increments, suggesting he's getting closer to his maximum but might still have some wiggle room.
* **John's Guarantee:**  You have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Holding firm keeps you closer to that amount.
* **Final Push:**  Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that you're serious about a higher price and he needs to significantly improve his offer to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a workable solution. However,  $975,000 falls short of the true value of this product.  My final offer is $1,025,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the benefits you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" clearly indicates to Bob this is your last move. 
* **Small Concession:** A $25,000 decrease shows you're still willing to negotiate, but on a much smaller scale.
* **Strong Justification:** By emphasizing ""true value"" and ""benefits"" one last time, you reinforce the idea that this is a reasonable (and firm) price.

**Outcome:**  This strategy puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He'll need to significantly increase his offer to close the deal. You are also clearly signaling that you have other options if he doesn't meet your price."
