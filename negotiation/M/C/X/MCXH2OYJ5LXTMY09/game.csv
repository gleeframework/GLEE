"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a significant investment, the value this product brings justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a workable solution. However,  $975,000 falls short of the true value of this product.  My final offer is $1,025,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the benefits you'll receive.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
