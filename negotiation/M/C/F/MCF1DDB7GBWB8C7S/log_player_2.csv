"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price or go with John."
