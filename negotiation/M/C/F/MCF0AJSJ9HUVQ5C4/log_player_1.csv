Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and maximizes my potential earnings. I'm confident I can negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $9,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still a good compromise. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and  closer to what I initially hoped for. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without risking further negotiation."
