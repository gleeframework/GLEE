"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $10,000. It's a fair price, considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to establish a baseline and avoid coming across as too aggressive.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without revealing too much. This is intended to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While I'm happy to sell for $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more if I counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I show him that I'm willing to negotiate and that his initial offer isn't satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to accommodate your needs. This price still reflects the value I place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not going too low. I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell.
* **Mid-ground:**  $9,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to go below $8,000 for the product. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  I don't want to waste more time on a deal that's unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  

Selling to John at $8,000 guarantees me my minimum and ensures a quick and certain sale."
