"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $110 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100, which is the price I was initially interested in. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider it?",100.0,Bob,4,
