Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $150.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John. 

Since you know John will buy the product for $150, you need to offer it to Bob at a price higher than $80 (his valuation) but lower than $150 to entice him.  

Offering it at $125 gives Bob a chance to get it at a price he might find attractive while still netting you a profit. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell to John."
