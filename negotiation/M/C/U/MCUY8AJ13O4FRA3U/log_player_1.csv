Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.
