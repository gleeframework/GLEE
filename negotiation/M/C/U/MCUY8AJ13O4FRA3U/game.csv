"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'll meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
