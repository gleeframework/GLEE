``` 

This offer is a starting point that is slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows good faith and an attempt to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further. Given the opportunity to sell to John for my desired price of $1,200,000, I'm going to take it."
