Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Value emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob's thoughts, signaling a willingness to negotiate, which can be helpful in securing a deal.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
