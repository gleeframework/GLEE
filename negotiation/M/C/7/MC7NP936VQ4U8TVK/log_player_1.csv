{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic [Product Name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $150 as my initial offer. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and highlighted the product's value. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a quick sale at a good price. 
    * If Bob rejects, I'll have a starting point for counteroffers and can adjust my strategy based on his response. 
    * I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $100 if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but still lower than my desired price.**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired $150 price point.
* **Counteroffering will give me more control over the deal.**  I can use Bob's initial counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered with $135, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  
* **Message:** I've kept the message polite and focused on finding a mutually agreeable price.  I've highlighted the value of the product again to reinforce its worth.
* **Strategy:** By counteroffering, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range. This approach aims to:
    *  Explore Bob's willingness to pay more.
    *  Keep the negotiation moving towards a successful transaction. 
    *  Maintain the option to sell to John if Bob continues to offer a price below my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John.** I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the effort.**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether and forcing me to settle for John's offer. 
* **This is a good compromise.** $125 is a solid price for the product, and accepting this offer ensures a successful sale."
