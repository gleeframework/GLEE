"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 represents significant value for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a considerable compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,400,000 is closer to your budget, it's a significant drop for me. Let's settle this right here, how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $1,600,000.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
