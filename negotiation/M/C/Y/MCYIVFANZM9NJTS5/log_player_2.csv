"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it's a better deal than John's offer. Let's see if we can get her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I could maybe do $75, but that's really pushing my budget."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We are strategically increasing our offer while still staying below John's price.  This keeps the negotiation moving and signals to Alice that we are serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our price target.  There's no point in negotiating further since we can get the same price from John. Accepting now ensures we get the product."
