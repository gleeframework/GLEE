Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

1. **Maximizing Profit:**  You aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($100) and closer to Bob's valuation. 
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $130 is your initial offer, there might be room for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to his maximum valuation.
3. **Staying Above John's Offer:** You ensure that even if Bob negotiates down, you'll still likely get a better price than John's offer."
