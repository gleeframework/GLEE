"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. Let's aim for a fair compromise. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $12,000 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a decent profit margin while being competitive in the market. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
