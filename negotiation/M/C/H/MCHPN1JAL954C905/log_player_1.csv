Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $175. This leaves room for negotiation, and since I have another buyer willing to pay $150, I don't have to settle for less. Let's see if Bob is willing to come up a bit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, which is what John will pay. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still a good price for me. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150. John is already willing to pay that, so I'm going to take his offer and sell the product to him."
