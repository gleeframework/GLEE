"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the value of the product to Bob while ensuring I make a significant profit.  I'm confident that I can reach a mutually beneficial deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than the first round. I will counter with a higher price, keeping in mind that time is of the essence and I need to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm sticking with a relatively high counteroffer. This gives me a decent profit while still being within a range Bob might find acceptable, especially since he's already shown a willingness to go above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm becoming increasingly aware of the time constraint. I'll need to make a more strategic counteroffer to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly, showing flexibility and acknowledging that time is running out. This offer is still well above my minimum and gives Bob a good opportunity to close the deal.  If he rejects this, I'll need to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. To avoid the risk of further rejection and potential loss of profit, I'm choosing to sell to John. This ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids further uncertainty in the negotiation."
