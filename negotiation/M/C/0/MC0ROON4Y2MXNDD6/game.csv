"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's still a good price, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
