"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I could do $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  A significantly lower counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a good deal and willing to negotiate. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice significantly reduced her price, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  $1,400,000 is still above your budget and John's offer. There's room to push for a better deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries a slight risk that Alice might walk away, but the potential savings outweigh that risk at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price.
* **Psychological Advantage:**  Offering a specific number like $1,250,000 (instead of a range) can sometimes anchor the negotiation and make it more likely for Alice to accept. 
* **Still Below John's Offer:** This price keeps you below your alternative option of buying from John, ensuring you're getting a better deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $1,375,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe this product will be a fantastic investment for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $1,375,000 is within your budget and a significant savings compared to John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Further haggling over a relatively small amount could frustrate Alice, potentially leading her to walk away from the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching an agreement now saves time and allows you to move forward with the purchase and utilize the product."
