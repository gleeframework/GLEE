"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I could do $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $1,375,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe this product will be a fantastic investment for your business.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
