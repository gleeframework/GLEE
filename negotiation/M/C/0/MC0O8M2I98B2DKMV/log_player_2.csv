"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation. It's likely that you can get a better deal by counter-offering and potentially pushing the price down closer to her $1,000,000 valuation. There's a good chance she'll want to make a deal, as it's still a profit for her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's certainly attractive, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still offers her a good profit margin. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Bob is serious about buying the product while also being mindful of his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,225,000 is still higher than her own valuation, and we're still closer to her value than to your maximum budget.  There's still room to negotiate, so it's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,162,500.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between the previous two offers and is a reasonable compromise. It's still a good profit for Alice and is closer to Bob's desired price point, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, $1,162,500 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  I'm willing to accept $1,193,750. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,193,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,193,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,193,750 is close to Bob's previous counteroffer of $1,162,500. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, especially since buying from John would cost significantly more. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and a good value for him."
