Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,450,000 is carefully positioned:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    * It's close enough to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) to ensure a substantial profit.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
