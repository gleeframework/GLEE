Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $40.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's reaction."
