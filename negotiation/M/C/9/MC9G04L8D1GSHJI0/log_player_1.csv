"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it holds significant value for your business as well.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. This price reflects both my needs and the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $775,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product and the value it holds for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to compromise, his offer is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price lower than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  While $775,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm confident this price allows both of us to achieve our goals.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product and the value it holds for you. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached my minimum threshold of $800,000.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, it's important to be pragmatic and secure a deal that meets my needs.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for the same price."
