{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation, which is important given you don't know Bob's valuation.  It also establishes that you are willing to talk and find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the unique value it offers and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $900000. I believe this price reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $1,000,000, Bob seems unwilling to go much higher. It's better to accept John's offer and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
