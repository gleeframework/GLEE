# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, I can't quite go down to $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?
