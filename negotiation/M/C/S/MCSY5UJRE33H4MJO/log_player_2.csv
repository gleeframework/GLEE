"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground between Alice's starting price and my ideal price.  It shows I'm interested but want a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That still leaves you with a good amount of value, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my target. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm on achieving a price closer to my goal. I'm aiming for a price that's still beneficial for Alice but represents a good deal for me."
