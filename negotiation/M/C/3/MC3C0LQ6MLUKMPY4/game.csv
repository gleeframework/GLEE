"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for this product. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $160 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's try $155. I'm serious about getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $150 is your final offer, Bob. However, I've already told you that I'm looking for at least $150. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small concession. I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value you'll get is $170. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,7,
