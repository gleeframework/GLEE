"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
