"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about we meet in the middle at $13750? That's a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the price I'm willing to go up to. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $12500. This is my absolute best offer, and it reflects the value I've placed on it. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity.",12500.0,Alice,5,
