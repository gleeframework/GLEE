``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price:** This makes it attractive to Bob, who values the product at $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back and forth, which could potentially lead to a higher price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  I'm not starting too low, which could make me look desperate.

I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $1,500,000, so I have a backup plan if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering his previous offers and the fact that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a deal with John."
