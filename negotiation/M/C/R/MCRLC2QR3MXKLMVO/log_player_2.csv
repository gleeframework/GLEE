# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse and you'd end up paying more to John."
