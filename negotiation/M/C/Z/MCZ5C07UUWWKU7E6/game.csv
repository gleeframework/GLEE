"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $8,000. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  The product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
