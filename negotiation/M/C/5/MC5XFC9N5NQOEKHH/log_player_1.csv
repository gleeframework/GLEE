Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so she can afford to be a bit more ambitious with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know the product's value to Bob, he doesn't know Alice's minimum price. This information asymmetry is key to the negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants to maintain a good relationship with Bob for potential future deals, she might be slightly less aggressive in her initial offer."
