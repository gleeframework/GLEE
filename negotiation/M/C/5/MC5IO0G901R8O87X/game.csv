"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value the product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm serious about purchasing the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can offer you a slightly higher price than $975,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my original price, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
