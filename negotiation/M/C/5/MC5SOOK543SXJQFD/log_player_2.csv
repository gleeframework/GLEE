"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,300,000? This price still allows for a good profit for me, while also being a fair deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price than John's offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product while saving $100,000 compared to John's price.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are relatively small, and the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and Bob needing to settle with John exists.  Therefore, accepting the current offer is the most sensible choice."
