While I could hold out for more, Bob has consistently shown resistance above $1,375,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting closer to my minimum or having to settle for John's offer."
