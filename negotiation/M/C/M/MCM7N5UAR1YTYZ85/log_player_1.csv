Round 4

Bob is still significantly under my minimum. I'll try to negotiate up a bit more, but I'm getting closer to John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts?

Bob is not budging, and I'm only $25,000 away from his offer. It's better to take a small profit now than risk him walking away and getting only $800,000 from John."
