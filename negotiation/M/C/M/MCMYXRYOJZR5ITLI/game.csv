"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $900000 doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 still doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident that this price still presents a lucrative opportunity for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
