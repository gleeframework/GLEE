Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly hinting at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing I have another buyer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is collaborative (""fair offer"", ""Let me know your thoughts"") encouraging Bob to engage and potentially negotiate.

**Goal:** The ideal scenario is that Bob counters with an offer closer to his $1,000,000 valuation.  I can then decide whether to meet him somewhere in the middle, maximizing my profit while still exceeding my $1,500,000 reserve from John."
