"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at no less than $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great value for you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,350,000? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to sell at your proposed price, it's just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still reflects a good value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within a tighter budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $1,325,000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your interest in this product, but $1,325,000 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1,350,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I've reviewed my budget once again and I'm comfortable moving forward with a proposal of $1,330,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties involved. I look forward to your response.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
