"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $810,000 is still a little above what I can justify.  I'm willing to pay $795,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work.",795000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to squeeze every last dollar out of this deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $795,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $805,000. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",805000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $805,000.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
