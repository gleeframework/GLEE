"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. Would you consider $600,000? I feel that's a fair price reflecting the value and my current situation.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $620,000.
