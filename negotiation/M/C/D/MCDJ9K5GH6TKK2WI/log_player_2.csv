Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $15,500. I think it's a great price that still reflects the product's value, and it's closer to my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out. I'm willing to pay $14,500, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go above $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $15,250. This is my best and final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is not budging significantly, and her latest offer is still higher than John's price. It's unlikely she'll go below John's price in the remaining rounds.  You've done well negotiating, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the $15,000 deal with John."
