"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially even more so than my own. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I could consider a price of $875,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $785,000?",785000.0,Bob,4,
