"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're enthusiastic about the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still too high for me.  My budget is firm at $8,000, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm open to exploring other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still above my budget. As I mentioned before, I'm committed to $8,000.  If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
