"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price still gives you a significant savings while ensuring I get a fair value for my product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
