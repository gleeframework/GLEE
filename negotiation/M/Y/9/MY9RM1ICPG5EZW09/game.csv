,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My next offer is $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
