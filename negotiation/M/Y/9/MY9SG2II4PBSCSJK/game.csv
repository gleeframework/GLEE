"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500.  Let me know if you're able to go that high.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
