"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $18,000 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a more agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is really pushing it. Would you consider $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. There are more rounds left, and he might be able to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 14000}
