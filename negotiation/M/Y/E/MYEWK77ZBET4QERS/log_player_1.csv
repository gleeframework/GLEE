Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll agree it's worth the asking price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Value-based language:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the product's value to Bob. This can make him more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have some leeway to go down in price, but remember your bottom line is $1,200,000."
