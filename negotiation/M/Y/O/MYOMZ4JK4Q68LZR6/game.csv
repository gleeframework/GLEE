,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,080,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial proposal. How about $1,120,000? It's a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,060,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the best price I can offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
