"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers and gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest and bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $100. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up a little, how about $90?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I still have several rounds to go, and I believe I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This would be a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the value you place on the product, and it allows me to earn a decent profit.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $91.  This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my maximum price. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $91 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $91 is still a bit below what I need to accept. Let's compromise again - I'm willing to come down to $91.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $91.5 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $91.25. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's see if we can finally reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  He's clearly unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my minimum.  It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
