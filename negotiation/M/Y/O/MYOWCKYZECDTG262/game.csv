"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $100. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up a little, how about $90?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This would be a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the value you place on the product, and it allows me to earn a decent profit.  Let's get this deal done.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $91.  This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my maximum price. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $91 is still a bit below what I need to accept. Let's compromise again - I'm willing to come down to $91.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",91.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $91.5 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $91.25. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's see if we can finally reach a deal.",91.25,Bob,8,
