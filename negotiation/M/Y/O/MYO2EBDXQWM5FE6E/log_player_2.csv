{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than buying from John at $8,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

```

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final chance to negotiate with Alice. Alice's offer of $9,550 is only $550 above Bob's target price of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept another counteroffer, and Bob is running out of time.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
