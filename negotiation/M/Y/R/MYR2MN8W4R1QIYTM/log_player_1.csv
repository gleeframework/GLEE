"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's still a good price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing some money compared to John, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,050 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can push for a bit more. I'm not comfortable selling for less than $11,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. $10,875 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, it seems like Bob isn't willing to budge much further. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and while $10,500 is better than nothing, it's not enough to make this worthwhile. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to secure a better deal."
