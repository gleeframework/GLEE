"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  I'm going to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for a potential compromise. I'm aiming to get as close to the product's value to Alice as possible without risking her rejecting the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my desired price range.  While $1,100,000 is better than her first offer, I can likely still get a better deal by continuing negotiations. I'm going to try and get closer to the $950,000 mark with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round.  Alice seems willing to negotiate, but she's still quite far from my ideal price.  By increasing my offer by $50,000, I hope to signal my willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price under $1,050,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer to get it for even less, I'm running out of rounds. It's likely I won't get a better price in the remaining rounds, and it's much better to get the product for $1,050,000 than to buy it from John for $1,500,000."
