"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's estimated value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired value. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my goal, I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I'm aware of Bob's willingness to pay more. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show commitment to a deal. This counteroffer is still above Bob's last offer, but is a good compromise. Hopefully this will incentivize Bob to accept and avoid further rounds."
