Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $20,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is offering your minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome.
