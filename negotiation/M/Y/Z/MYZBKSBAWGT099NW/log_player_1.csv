"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, as its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not an outrageous one. This will give me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to me, subtly implying it's worth even more than the asking price. This might encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still quite a bit lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I have 8 rounds remaining, so I can afford to be a bit more persistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I have 6 rounds remaining, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to come down to $962,500. This is a fair compromise, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 962500}
```

I'm continuing the strategy of splitting the difference, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit.  With 5 rounds left, I'm getting closer to a point where I might consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge, but I'm not there yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $925000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting close to the point where I'd have to sell to John. While $925,000 is not ideal, it's a decent profit, and Bob's offers have been steadily increasing. It's likely that if I reject this offer, he might counter with a lower price or even stop negotiating. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a good profit and avoid risking a worse outcome."
