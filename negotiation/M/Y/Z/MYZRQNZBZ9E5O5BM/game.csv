"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175 to try and work something out.  Let me know if that's a price we can agree on.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested, but $175 is still a bit high for me. How about $150? I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
