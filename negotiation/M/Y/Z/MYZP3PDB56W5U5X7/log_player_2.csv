"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $100, and both Alice and John are offering the product for $100, it makes no difference who you buy from. You might as well accept Alice's offer as it saves you the hassle of going to John."
