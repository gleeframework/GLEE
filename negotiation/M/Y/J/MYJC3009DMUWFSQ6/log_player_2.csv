"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price point and potentially get a better deal. 
* **John is a fallback option:** Having the option to buy from John for $10,000 provides a safety net, but Bob wants to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This price is fair considering your value of the product and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  Bob is proposing a price that is still higher than Alice's value but lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he is willing to negotiate.
* **Clear communication:** The message highlights Bob's interest in the product and provides a justification for the lower price.
* **Strategic pricing:**  The $8,500 offer leaves room for further negotiation, but also makes it clear that Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and my minimum requirement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fair price:** Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500, and it still provides Alice with a profit. 
* **Time pressure:** With 7 rounds remaining, it's becoming more likely that John's offer will become more attractive, leading to a higher price.
* **Opportunity to save:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $8,800 is the best option for Bob in this round. It strikes a balance between a good deal and minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity or paying more in the future."
