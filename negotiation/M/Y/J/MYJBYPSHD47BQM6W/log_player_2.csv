# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying from Alice at $1,100,000.  We should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

While Alice is getting closer, $975,000 is still too high. We need to continue negotiating to get the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, I can't go as low as $900,000.  My final offer is $950,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $950,000 is getting closer to our budget, it's still a bit too high.  At this point, it's better to go with John and secure the product for $800,000.  We can't risk going further with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal or no deal at all."
