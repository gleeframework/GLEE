"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $7,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counter offer Alice. I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere.  How about we split the difference and say $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
