"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at. Let me know if that's acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
