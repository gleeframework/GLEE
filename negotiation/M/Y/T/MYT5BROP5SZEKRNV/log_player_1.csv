"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at. Let me know if that's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
