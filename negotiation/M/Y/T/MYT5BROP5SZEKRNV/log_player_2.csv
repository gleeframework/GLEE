"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product which I believe would be of great value to you. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase it for $1,500,000. This price reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also the potential return on investment for you. Should you find this proposal attractive, please let me know, and we can proceed to finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,200,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at. Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
