Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly unique. I know you've been looking for something like this, and I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, so you can afford to be bold with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. Starting higher gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a price above your guaranteed sale. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer around the product's value and your understanding of Bob's needs, you make it more palatable.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might start with a less aggressive offer to leave room for back-and-forth."
