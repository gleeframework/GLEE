Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this work.  This price still reflects the significant value of this product and provides a good margin for you to realize substantial returns. Let's bridge the gap and get this deal done.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I have 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I want to see if I can get Alice closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking with my previous offer, emphasizing that it's a fair price and I'm ready to buy.
