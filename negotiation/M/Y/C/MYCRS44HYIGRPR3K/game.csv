"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this work.  This price still reflects the significant value of this product and provides a good margin for you to realize substantial returns. Let's bridge the gap and get this deal done.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
