"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $130 is below your maximum price of $150, you can likely get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There is room for negotiation, as the product is worth less to Alice ($80) than it is to you. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you demonstrate that you are willing to walk away, which could encourage Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** Offering $100 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to getting a better deal. This also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Focuses on value:**  The message emphasizes that the price is ""a bit high for you,"" subtly reminding Alice of the value gap. 
* **Open to compromise:** The message concludes with ""Let me know if that works for you,"" indicating a willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can come down a bit to $115. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  $115 is a good price for you, considering the product is worth $150 to you. 
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so rejecting it could lead to a stalemate and you might end up buying from John for a higher price.
* **Limited potential for further negotiation:** While you could counteroffer again, there is a risk that Alice will stick to her final offer, and you'll miss out on a good deal."
