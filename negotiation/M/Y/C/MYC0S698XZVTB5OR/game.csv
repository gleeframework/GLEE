"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I value it at a minimum of $1,500,000, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet me in this range?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,750,000. Considering my budget constraints, could we perhaps settle on $1,500,000? This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
