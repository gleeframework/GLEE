Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my research and needs, I believe the product's value to me is closer to $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, there's potential to get more from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true potential it holds for your needs.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1025000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price."
