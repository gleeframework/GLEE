"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about we meet at $1,000,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
