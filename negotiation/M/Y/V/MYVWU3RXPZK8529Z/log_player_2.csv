# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am proposing a revised price of $700,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your feedback and our ongoing discussion, I propose a price of $687,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the value you see in the product.

Alice is clearly meeting me in the middle with each counteroffer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to go with John at $800,000 is too high. Accepting $687,500 is a good compromise."
