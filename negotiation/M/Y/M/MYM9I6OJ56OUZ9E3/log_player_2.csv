"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. Going straight to John guarantees the product at my maximum price, but there's a chance to get it cheaper from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer to see how much wiggle room Alice might have. It's a common negotiation tactic to begin lower than your true desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign.  She's still slightly above my ideal price, so I'll counter again to see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?"",
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a price directly in the middle of our current positions.  It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $107.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.25. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating in smaller increments now. While I could try to haggle further, $111.25 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer. It's better to secure a good price now than risk the negotiations stalling out and losing the opportunity."
