I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,500. This gives me a good starting point, aiming for a profit while also leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that is lower than what John is offering. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than what John is offering. I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and I'm not willing to risk going lower. While I'd prefer a higher price, John is a sure thing and offers a good return. I'll sell the product to John."
