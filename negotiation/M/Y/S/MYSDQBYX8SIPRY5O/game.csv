"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can agree on this.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential deal, $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
