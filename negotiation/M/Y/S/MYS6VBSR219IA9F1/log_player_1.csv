Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be valued even higher. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering the product at $120, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, we've made a significant profit. If he rejects, we can always negotiate down or sell to John for our minimum price.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While the product is worth $80 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or if it's difficult to find elsewhere."
