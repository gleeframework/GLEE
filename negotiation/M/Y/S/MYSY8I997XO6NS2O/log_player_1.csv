"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still significantly lower than both my minimum price and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to come down that far, I'm going to have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob seems pretty firm on his $12,000 offer and it's unlikely I'll be able to bridge the gap significantly.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer.
