Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but the price is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is considerably lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product has significant potential, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product represents, and I am serious about purchasing it.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would $975,000 be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below what we know Bob is willing to pay. While John offers a safe $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate further with Bob and potentially secure a much better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I can tell you're serious, so let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has effectively met us in the middle, exceeding our minimum and demonstrating his strong interest. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away."
