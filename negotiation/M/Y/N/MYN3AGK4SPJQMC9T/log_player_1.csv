{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still making a profit, and it leaves room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob understands exactly what you're offering. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation! You'll need to be flexible and adapt to Bob's responses. You can always refer to John's offer of $15,000 as a backup if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll need to make a counteroffer that gets us closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm really working with a tight budget.  Could you do $9,750?  That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm going to need to counter his offer once more. If he doesn't come up to a price closer to $10,000, I might have to consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
