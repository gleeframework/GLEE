"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm really working with a tight budget.  Could you do $9,750?  That's the most I can offer.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
