Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting with a relatively high price, you signal that you believe in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always lower your price if Bob rejects your offer, but starting high gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and likely leaves less profit margin than you'd like. 
* **There's room for counter-negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to pay above your minimum. This means there's still potential to reach a more favorable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, aiming for a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it's closer to your initial offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're still firm on your value, but willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **It's a clear and reasonable proposal:** You've given Bob a specific number and a clear explanation for your reasoning.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:**  $10,750 is just $750 below your minimum, which is a relatively small difference considering the potential profit.
* **Bob is showing continued interest:**  He's still willing to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product.
* **There's a chance he won't go higher:**  He's already lowered his offer twice, and further negotiation might result in a lower offer or even a stalemate.

By accepting Bob's offer, you can secure a sale, make a profit, and avoid risking a prolonged negotiation that might lead to a less favorable outcome or even a sale to John at a lower price."
