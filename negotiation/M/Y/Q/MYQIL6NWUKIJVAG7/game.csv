"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11,500 to be comfortable. Can we discuss the possibility of $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is the lowest I can go. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",11250.0,Alice,5,
