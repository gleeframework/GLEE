"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price that we can both be happy with. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $9,500 is still too high for me. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. I'd like to propose a final offer of $8,000. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make the deal",8000.0,Bob,6,
