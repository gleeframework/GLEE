Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time, non-negotiable offer. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer, I can aim significantly higher.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's high value without revealing my hand.
* **Urgency and Clarity:** The ""one-time, non-negotiable"" phrase aims to encourage a quick decision from Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy allows me to potentially gain an extra $500,000 while minimizing risk."
