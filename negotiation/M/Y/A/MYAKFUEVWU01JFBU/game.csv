"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its potential value, my budget is more limited. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $800000? I believe this would allow both of us to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
