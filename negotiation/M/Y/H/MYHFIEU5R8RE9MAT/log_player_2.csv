"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $175 is higher than our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. We acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest in the product. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to buy the product for significantly less than John's $150 price, hence the lower starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we still have room to negotiate.  Getting closer to $150 (John's price) makes it less worthwhile to haggle further. Let's try a counteroffer that's closer to our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between Alice's $130 and our previous $110. 
* **Direct and Reasonable:** We're suggesting a specific price and presenting it as a fair solution.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We're still below our $150 walk-away point, leaving space for a final adjustment if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $125.  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $125 is a solid price, saving us $25 compared to John's offer.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few more dollars in savings.
* **Time Saved:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth and secures the deal."
