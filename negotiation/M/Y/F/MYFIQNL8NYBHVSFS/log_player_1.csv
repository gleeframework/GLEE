Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $120, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to rush into a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to pay more than $88 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to lower my price that much, and I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $120.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
