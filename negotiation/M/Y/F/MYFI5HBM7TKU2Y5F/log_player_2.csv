{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while still staying within his budget. He knows that Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and he's hoping to get it for closer to his own valuation of $1,000,000. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a compromise, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, hoping to meet Alice in the middle. This offer is still below Alice's last counteroffer, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum budget.  She has shown she is not willing to compromise further. It's better for Bob to secure the product from John for a lower price than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk losing out on the deal altogether."
